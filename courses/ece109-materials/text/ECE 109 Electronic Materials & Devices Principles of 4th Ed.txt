Left: Circular bright rings make up the diffraction pattern
obtained when an electron beam is passed through a
thin polycrystalline aluminum sheet. The pattern results
from the wave behavior of the electrons; the waves are
diffracted by the Al crystals. Right: A magnet brought to
the screen bends the electron paths and distorts the diffraction pattern. The magnet would have no effect if the
pattern was due to X-rays, which are electromagnetic
waves. Courtesy of Farley Chicilo

PREFACE
FOURTH EDITION
The textbook represents a first course in electronic materials and devices for undergraduate
students. With the additional topics, the text can
also be used in a graduate-level introductory
course in electronic materials for electrical engineers and material scientists. The fourth edition is
an extensively revised and extended version of
the third edition based on reviewer comments and
the developments in electronic and optoelectronic
materials over the last ten years. The fourth edition has many new and expanded topics, new
worked examples, new illustrations, and new
homework problems. The majority of the illustrations have been greatly improved to make them
clearer. A very large number of new homework
problems have been added, and many more solved
problems have been provided that put the concepts into applications. More than 50% of the illustrations have gone through some kind of
revision to improve the clarity. Furthermore,
more terms have been added under Defining
Terms, which the students have found very useful.
Bragg’s diffraction law that is mentioned in several chapters is kept as Appendix A for those
readers who are unfamiliar with it.
The fourth edition is one of the few books on
the market that have a broad coverage of electronic materials that today’s scientists and engineers need. I believe that the revisions have
improved the rigor without sacrificing the original semiquantitative approach that both the students and instructors liked. The major revisions in
scientific content can be summarized as follows:
Chapter 1

Thermal expansion; kinetic molecular theory; atomic diffusion;
molecular collisions and vacuum
deposition; particle flux density;

Chapter 2

line defects; planar defects; crystal
surfaces; Grüneisen’s rule.
Temperature dependence of resistivity, strain gauges, Hall effect;
ionic conduction; Einstein relation
for drift mobility and diffusion;
ac conductivity; resistivity of thin
films; interconnects in microelectronics; electromigration.
Electron as a wave; infinite potential well; confined electron in a
finite potential energy well; stimulated emission and photon amplification; He–Ne laser, optical fiber
amplification.
Work function; electron photoemission; secondary emission;
electron affinity and photomultiplication; Fermi–Dirac statistics;
conduction in metals; thermoelectricity and Seebeck coefficient;
thermocouples; phonon concentration changes with temperature.
Degenerate semiconductors; direct
and indirect recombination; E vs.
k diagrams for direct and indirect
bandgap semiconductors; Schottky
junction and depletion layer;

ORGANIZATION AND FEATURES
In preparing the fourth edition, as in previous edition, I tried to keep the general treatment and
various proofs at a semiquantitative level without
going into detailed physics. Many of the problems
have been set to satisfy engineering accreditation

Elementary Materials
Science Concepts1

Understanding the basic building blocks of matter has been one of the most intriguing endeavors of humankind. Our understanding of interatomic interactions has now
reached a point where we can quite comfortably explain the macroscopic properties
of matter, based on quantum mechanics and electrostatic interactions between electrons and ionic nuclei in the material. There are many properties of materials that
can be explained by a classical treatment of the subject. In this chapter, as well as
in Chapter 2, we treat the interactions in a material from a classical perspective and
introduce a number of elementary concepts. These concepts do not invoke any quantum
mechanics, which is a subject of modern physics and is introduced in Chapter 3.
Although many useful engineering properties of materials can be treated with hardly
any quantum mechanics, it is impossible to develop the science of electronic materials
and devices without modern physics.
1.1

ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND ATOMIC NUMBER

The model of the atom that we must use to understand the atom’s general behavior
involves quantum mechanics, a topic we will study in detail in Chapter 3. For the
present, we will simply accept the following facts about a simplified, but intuitively
satisfactory, atomic model called the shell model, based on the Bohr model (1913).
The mass of the atom is concentrated at the nucleus, which contains protons and
neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles, whereas neutrons are neutral particles, and both have about the same mass. Although there is a Coulombic repulsion

between the protons, all the protons and neutrons are held together in the nucleus
by the strong force, which is a powerful, fundamental, natural force between particles. This force has a very short range of influence, typically less than 10−15 m.
When the protons and neutrons are brought together very closely, the strong force
overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between the protons and keeps the nucleus
intact. The number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number Z of the element.
The electrons are assumed to be orbiting the nucleus at very large distances
compared to the size of the nucleus. There are as many orbiting electrons as there
are protons in the nucleus. An important assumption in the Bohr model is that only
certain orbits with fixed radii are stable around the nucleus. For example, the closest
orbit of the electron in the hydrogen atom can only have a radius of 0.053 nm. Since
the electron is constantly moving around an orbit with a given radius, over a long
time period (perhaps ∼10−12 seconds on the atomic time scale), the electron would
appear as a spherical negative-charge cloud around the nucleus and not as a single
dot representing a finite particle. We can therefore view the electron as a charge
contained within a spherical shell of a given radius.
Due to the requirement of stable orbits, the electrons therefore do not randomly
occupy the whole region around the nucleus. Instead, they occupy various welldefined spherical regions. They are distributed in various shells and subshells within
the shells, obeying certain occupation (or seating) rules.2 The example for the carbon
atom is shown in Figure 1.1.
The shells and subshells that define the whereabouts of the electrons are labeled
using two sets of integers, n and ℓ. These integers are called the principal and
orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively. (The meanings of
these names are not critical at this point.) The integers n and ℓ have the values
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , and ℓ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and ℓ < n. For each choice of n,
there are n values of ℓ, so higher-order shells contain more subshells. The shells
corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . are labeled by the capital letters K, L, M, N, . . . ,
and the subshells denoted by ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . are labeled s, p, d, f . . . . The
2

In Chapter 3, in which we discuss the quantum mechanical model of the atom, we will see that these shells
and subshells are spatial regions around the nucleus where the electrons are most likely to be found.

subshell with ℓ = 1 in the n = 2 shell is thus labeled the 2p subshell, based on the
standard notation nℓ.
There is a definite rule to filling up the subshells with electrons; we cannot
simply put all the electrons in one subshell. The number of electrons a given subshell
can take is fixed by nature to be3 2(2ℓ + 1). For the s subshell (ℓ = 0), there are
two electrons, whereas for the p subshell, there are six electrons, and so on. Table 1.1
summarizes the most number of electrons that can be put into various subshells and
shells of an atom. Obviously, the larger the shell, the more electrons it can take,
simply because it contains more subshells. The shells and subshells are filled starting with those closest to the nucleus as explained next.
The number of electrons in a subshell is indicated by a superscript on the subshell symbol, so the electronic structure, or configuration, of the carbon atom (atomic
number 6) shown in Figure 1.1 becomes 1s22s22p2. The K shell has only one subshell, which is full with two electrons. This is the structure of the inert element He.
We can therefore write the electronic configuration more simply as [He]2s22p2. The
general rule is to put the nearest previous inert element, in this case He, in square
brackets and write the subshells thereafter.
The electrons occupying the outer subshells are the farthest away from the
nucleus and have the most important role in atomic interactions, as in chemical reactions, because these electrons are the first to interact with outer electrons on neighboring atoms. The outermost electrons are called valence electrons and they
determine the valency of the atom. Figure 1.1 shows that carbon has four valence
electrons in the L shell.
When a subshell is full of electrons, it cannot accept any more electrons and it
is said to have acquired a stable configuration. This is the case with the inert elements at the right-hand side of the Periodic Table, all of which have completely
filled subshells and are rarely involved in chemical reactions. The majority of such
elements are gases inasmuch as the atoms do not bond together easily to form a
liquid or solid. They are sometimes used to provide an inert atmosphere instead of
air for certain reactive materials.

We will actually show this in Chapter 3 using quantum mechanics.

CHAPTER 1

∙

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

In an atom such as the Li atom, there are two electrons in the 1s subshell and
one electron in the 2s subshell. The atomic structure of Li is 1s22s1. The third electron is in the 2s subshell, rather than any other subshell, because this is the arrangement of the electrons that results in the lowest overall energy for the whole atom. It
requires energy (work) to take the third electron from the 2s to the 2p or higher
subshells as will be shown in Chapter 3. Normally the zero energy reference corresponds to the electron being at infinity, that is, isolated from the atom. When the
electron is inside the atom, its energy is negative, which is due to the attraction of
the positive nucleus. An electron that is closer to the nucleus has a lower energy.
The electrons nearer the nucleus are more closely bound and have higher binding
energies. The 1s22s1 configuration of electrons corresponds to the lowest energy
structure for Li and, at the same time, obeys the occupation rules for the subshells.
If the 2s electron is somehow excited to another outer subshell, the energy of the
atom increases, and the atom is said to be excited.
The smallest energy required to remove a single electron from a neutral atom
and thereby create a positive ion (cation) and an isolated electron is defined as the
ionization energy of the atom. The Na atom has only a single valence electron in
its outer shell, which is the easiest to remove. The energy required to remove this
electron is 5.1 electron volts (eV), which is the Na atom’s ionization energy. The
electron affinity represents the energy that is needed, or released, when we add an
electron to a neutral atom to create a negative ion (anion). Notice that the ionization
term implies the generation of a positive ion, whereas the electron affinity implies
that we have created a negative ion. Certain atoms, notably the halogens (such as F,
Cl, Br, and I), can actually attract an electron to form a negative ion. Their electron
affinities are negative. When we place an electron into a Cl atom, we find that an
energy of 3.6 eV is released. The Cl− ion has a lower energy than the Cl atom,
which means that it is energetically favorable to form a Cl− ion by introducing an
electron into the Cl atom.
There is a very useful theorem in physics, called the Virial theorem, that
allows us to relate the average kinetic energy KE, average potential energy PE, and
average total or overall energy E of an electron in an atom, or electrons and nuclei
in a molecule, through two remarkably simple relationships,4
Virial
theorem

E = KE + PE

and

1
KE = − PE
2

[1.1]

For example, if we define zero energy for the H atom as the H+ ion and the electron infinitely separated, then the energy of the electron in the H atom is −13.6 eV. It
takes 13.6 eV to ionize the H atom. The average PE of the electron, due to its
Coulombic interaction with the positive nucleus, is −27.2 eV. Its average KE turns
out to be 13.6 eV. Example 1.1 uses the Virial theorem to calculate the radius of
the hydrogen atom, the velocity of the electron, and its frequency of rotation.

4

While the final result stated in Equation 1.1 is elegantly simple, the actual proof is quite involved and certainly
not trivial. As stated here, the Virial theorem applies to a system of charges that interact through electrostatic
forces only.

It takes 13.6 eV to ionize the hydrogen atom, i.e., to remove the electron to infinity.

−13.6 eV. Calculate the average PE and average KE of the electron.
Assume that the electron is in a stable orbit of radius ro around the positive nucleus.
What is the Coulombic PE of the electron? Hence, what is the radius ro of the electron orbit?

ATOMIC MASS AND MOLE

We had defined the atomic number Z as the number of protons in the nucleus of an
atom. The atomic mass number A is simply the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. It may be thought that we can use the atomic mass number A
of an atom to gauge its atomic mass, but this is done slightly differently to account
for the existence of different isotopes of an element; isotopes are atoms of a given
element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons in
the nucleus. The atomic mass unit (amu) u is a convenient atomic mass unit that
is equal to 121 of the mass of a neutral carbon atom that has a mass number A = 12
(6 protons and 6 neutrons). It has been found that u = 1.66054 × 10−27 kg.
The atomic mass or relative atomic mass or simply atomic weight Mat of an
element is the average atomic mass, in atomic mass units, of all the naturally occurring
isotopes of the element. Atomic masses are listed in the Periodic Table. Avogadro’s
number NA is the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12, which is
6.022 × 1023 to three decimal places. Since the atomic mass Mat is defined as 121 of
the mass of the carbon-12 atom, it is straightforward to show that NA number of atoms
of any substance have a mass equal to the atomic mass Mat in grams.
A mole of a substance is that amount of the substance that contains exactly
Avogadro’s number NA of atoms or molecules that make up the substance. One
mole of a substance has a mass as much as its atomic (molecular) mass in grams.
For example, 1 mole of copper contains 6.022 × 1023 number of copper atoms and
has a mass of 63.55 grams. Thus, an amount of an element that has 6.022 × 1023
atoms has a mass in grams equal to the atomic mass. This means we can express
the atomic mass as grams per unit mole (g mol−1). The atomic mass of Au is
196.97 amu or g mol−1. Thus, a 10 gram bar of gold has (10 g)∕(196.97 g mol−1)
or 0.0507 moles.
Frequently we have to convert the composition of a substance from atomic percentage to weight percentage, and vice versa. Compositions in materials engineering
generally use weight percentages, whereas chemical formulas are given in terms of
atomic composition. Suppose that a substance (an alloy or a compound) is composed
of two elements, A and B. Let the weight fractions of A and B be wA and wB,
respectively. Let nA and nB be the atomic or molar fractions of A and B; that is, nA
represents the fraction of type A atoms, nB represents the fraction of type B atoms

in the whole substance, and nA + nB = 1. Suppose that the atomic masses of A and
B are MA and MB. Then nA and nB are given by
nA =

wA∕MA + wB∕MB

and

nB = 1 − nA

where wA + wB = 1. Equation 1.2 can be readily rearranged to obtain wA and wB in
terms of nA and nB.
COMPOSITIONS IN ATOMIC AND WEIGHT PERCENTAGES Consider a Pb–Sn solder that
is 38.1 wt.% Pb and 61.9 wt.% Sn (this is the eutectic composition with the lowest melting
point). What are the atomic fractions of Pb and Sn in this solder?

EXAMPLE 1.2

SOLUTION

For Pb, the weight fraction and atomic mass are, respectively, wA = 0.381 and MA =
207.2 g mol−1 and for Sn, wB = 0.619 and MB = 118.71 g mol−1. Thus, Equation 1.2 gives
nA =

wA∕MA
(0.381)∕(207.2)
=
wA∕MA + wB∕MB 0.381∕207.2 + 0.619∕118.71
= 0.261

and

nB =

or

26.1 at.%

wB∕MB
(0.619)∕(118.71)
=
wA∕MA + wB∕MB 0.381∕207.2 + 0.619∕118.71
= 0.739

or

73.9 at.%

Thus the alloy is 26.1 at.% Pb and 73.9 at.% Sn, which can be written as Pb0.261 Sn0.739.

BONDING AND TYPES OF SOLIDS

1.3.1 MOLECULES AND GENERAL BONDING PRINCIPLES
When two atoms are brought together, the valence electrons interact with each other
and with the neighbor’s positively charged nucleus. The result of this interaction is
often the formation of a bond between the two atoms, producing a molecule. The
formation of a bond means that the energy of the system of two atoms together must
be less than that of the two atoms separated, so that the molecule formation is energetically favorable, that is, more stable. The general principle of molecule formation
is illustrated in Figure 1.3a, showing two atoms brought together from infinity. As
the two atoms approach each other, the atoms exert attractive and repulsive forces
on each other as a result of mutual electrostatic interactions. Initially, the attractive
force FA dominates over the repulsive force FR. The net force FN is the sum of the two,
FN = FA + FR

and this is initially attractive, as indicated in Figure 1.3a. Note that we have defined
the attractive force as negative and repulsive force as positive in Figure 1.3a.5
5

In some materials science books and in the third edition of this book, the attractive force is shown as positive,
which is an arbitrary choice. A positive attractive force is more appealing to our intuition.

by integrating the net force FN. Figure 1.3a and b show the variation of the net force
FN(r) and the overall potential energy E(r) with the interatomic separation r as the
two atoms are brought together from infinity. The lowering of energy corresponds
to an attractive interaction between the two atoms.
The variations of FA and FR with distance are different. Force FA varies slowly,
whereas FR varies strongly with separation and is strongest when the two atoms are
very close. When the atoms are so close that the individual electron shells overlap,
there is a very strong electron-to-electron shell repulsion and FR dominates. An
equilibrium will be reached when the attractive force just balances the repulsive force
and the net force is zero, or
FN = FA + FR = 0

[1.3]

In this state of equilibrium, the atoms are separated by a certain distance ro, as
shown in Figure 1.3. This distance is called the equilibrium separation and is effectively
6

Remember that the change dE in the PE is the work done by the force, dE = −FN dr. In Figure 1.3b, when the
atoms are far separated, dE/dr is negative, which represents an attractive force.

1.3

BONDING AND TYPES OF SOLIDS

the bond length. On the energy diagram, FN = 0 means dE∕dr = 0, which means
that the equilibrium of two atoms corresponds to the potential energy of the system
acquiring its minimum value. Consequently, the molecule will only be formed if
the energy of the two atoms as they approach each other can attain a minimum.
This minimum energy also defines the bond energy of the molecule, as depicted in
Figure 1.3b. An energy of Ebond is required to separate the two atoms, and this represents
the bond energy.
Although we considered only two atoms, similar arguments also apply to bonding between many atoms, or between billions of atoms as in a typical solid. Although
the actual details of FA and FR will change from material to material, the general
principle that there is a bonding energy Ebond per atom and an equilibrium interatomic
separation ro will still be valid. Even in a solid in the presence of many interacting
atoms, we can still identify a general potential energy curve E(r) per atom similar to
the type shown in Figure 1.3b. We can also use the curve to understand the properties
of the solid, such as the thermal expansion coefficient and elastic and bulk moduli.

1.3.2 COVALENTLY BONDED SOLIDS: DIAMOND
Two atoms can form a bond with each other by sharing some or all of their valence
electrons and thereby reducing the overall potential energy of the combination. The
covalent bond results from the sharing of valence electrons to complete the subshells
of each atom. Figure 1.4 shows the formation of a covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms as they come together to form the H2 molecule. When the 1s subshells
overlap, the electrons are shared by both atoms and each atom now has a complete
subshell. As illustrated in Figure 1.4, electrons 1 and 2 must now orbit both atoms;

toward the corners of a tetrahedron.

they therefore cross the overlap region more frequently, indeed twice as often. Thus,
electron sharing, on average, results in a greater concentration of negative charge in
the region between the two nuclei, which keeps the two nuclei bonded to each other.
Furthermore, by synchronizing their motions, electrons 1 and 2 can avoid crossing
the overlap region at the same time. For example, when electron 1 is at the far right
(or left), electron 2 is in the overlap region; later, the situation is reversed.
The electronic structure of the carbon atom is [He]2s22p2 with four empty seats
in the 2p subshell. The 2s and 2p subshells, however, are quite close. When other
atoms are in the vicinity, as a result of interatomic interactions, the two subshells
become indistinguishable and we can consider only the shell itself, which is the L
shell with a capacity of eight electrons. It is clear that the C atom with four vacancies in the L shell can readily share electrons with four H atoms, as depicted in
Figure 1.5a and b, whereby the C atom and each of the H atoms attain complete
shells. This is the CH4 molecule, which is the gas methane. The repulsion between
the electrons in one bond and the electrons in a neighboring bond causes the bonds
to spread as far out from each other as possible, so that in three dimensions, the H
atoms occupy the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron and the CH bonds are at an
angle of 109.5° to each other, as sketched in Figure 1.5c.
The C atom can also share electrons with other C atoms, as shown in Figure 1.6.
Each neighboring C atom can share electrons with other C atoms, leading to a threedimensional network of a covalently bonded structure. This is the structure of the
precious diamond crystal, in which all the carbon atoms are covalently bonded to
each other, as depicted in the figure. The coordination number (CN) is the number
of nearest neighbors for a given atom in the solid. As is apparent in Figure 1.6, the
coordination number for a carbon atom in the diamond crystal structure is 4.
Due to the strong Coulombic attraction between the shared electrons and the
positive nuclei, the covalent bond energy is usually the highest for all bond types,

neighbors, forming a regular three-dimensional
pattern of atoms that constitutes the diamond

leading to very high melting temperatures and very hard solids: diamond is one of
the hardest known materials.
Covalently bonded solids are also insoluble in nearly all solvents. The directional
nature and strength of the covalent bond also make these materials nonductile (or
nonmalleable). Under a strong force, they exhibit brittle fracture. Further, since all
the valence electrons are locked in the bonds between the atoms, these electrons are
not free to drift in the crystal when an electric field is applied. Consequently, the
electrical conductivity of such materials is very poor.

1.3.3 METALLIC BONDING: COPPER
Metal atoms have only a few valence electrons, which are not very difficult to
remove. When many metal atoms are brought together to form a solid, these valence
electrons are lost from individual atoms and become collectively shared by all the
ions. The valence electrons therefore become delocalized and form an electron gas
or electron cloud, permeating the space between the ions, as depicted in Figure 1.7.
The attraction between the negative charge of this electron gas and the metal ions
more than compensates for the energy initially required to remove the valence electrons from the individual atoms. Thus, the bonding in a metal is essentially due to
the attraction between the stationary metal ions and the freely wandering electrons
between the ions.
The bond is a collective sharing of electrons and is therefore nondirectional.
Consequently, the metal ions try to get as close as possible, which leads to close-packed
crystal structures with high coordination numbers, compared to covalently bonded
solids. In the particular example shown in Figure 1.7, Cu+ ions are packed as closely
as possible by the gluing effect of the electrons between the ions, forming a crystal
structure called the face-centered cubic (FCC). The FCC crystal structure, as
explained later in Section 1.9, has Cu+ ions at the corners of a cube and a Cu+ at
the center of each cube-face. (See Figure 1.32.)

Figure 1.7 In metallic bonding, the valence electrons from the metal atoms form a “cloud
of electrons,” which fills the space between the metal ions and “glues” the ions together
through Coulombic attraction between the electron gas and the positive metal ions.

The results of this type of bonding are dramatic. First, the nondirectional nature
of the bond means that under an applied force, metal ions are able to move with
respect to each other, especially in the presence of certain crystal defects (such as
dislocations). Thus, metals tend to be ductile. Most importantly, however, the “free”
valence electrons in the electron gas can respond readily to an applied electric field
and drift along the force of the field, which is the reason for the high electrical
conductivity of metals. Furthermore, if there is a temperature gradient along a metal
bar, the free electrons can also contribute to the energy transfer from the hot to the
cold regions, since they frequently collide with the metal ions and thereby transfer
energy. Metals therefore, typically, also have good thermal conductivities; that is,
they easily conduct heat. This is why when you touch your finger to a metal it feels
cold because it conducts heat “away” from the finger to the ambient (making the
fingertip “feel” cold).

1.3.4 IONICALLY BONDED SOLIDS: SALT
Common table salt, NaCl, is a classic example of a solid in which the atoms are
held together by ionic bonding. Ionic bonding is frequently found in materials that
normally have a metal and a nonmetal as the constituent elements. Sodium (Na) is
an alkaline metal with only one valence electron that can easily be removed to form
an Na+ ion with complete subshells. The ion Na+ looks like the inert element Ne,
but with a positive charge. Chlorine has five electrons in its 3p subshell and can
readily accept one more electron to close this subshell. By taking the electron given
up by the Na atom, the Cl atom becomes negatively charged and looks like the inert
element Ar with a net negative charge. Transferring the valence electron of Na to
Cl thus results in two oppositely charged ions, Na+ and Cl−, which are called the
cation and anion, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.8. As a result of the Coulombic
force, the two ions pull each other until the attractive force is just balanced by the

repulsive force between the closed electron shells. Initially, energy is needed to
remove the electron from the Na atom and transfer it to the Cl atom. However, this
is more than compensated for by the energy of Coulombic attraction between the
two resulting oppositely charged ions, and the net effect is a lowering of the potential
energy of the Na+ and Cl− ion pair.
When many Na and Cl atoms are ionized and brought together, the resulting
collection of ions is held together by the Coulombic attraction between the Na+ and
Cl− ions. The solid thus consists of Na+ cations and Cl− anions holding each other
through the Coulombic force, as depicted in Figure 1.9. The Coulombic force around
a charge is nondirectional; also, it can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the
polarity of the interacting ions. There are also repulsive Coulombic forces between
the Na+ ions themselves and between the Cl− ions themselves. For the solid to be
stable, each Na+ ion must therefore have Cl− ions as nearest neighbors and vice versa
so that like-ions are not close to each other.
The ions are in equilibrium and the solid is stable when the net potential
energy is minimum, or dE∕dr = 0. Figure 1.10 illustrates the variation of the net
potential energy for a pair of ions as the interatomic distance r is reduced from
infinity to less than the equilibrium separation, that is, as the ions are brought
together from infinity. Zero energy corresponds to separated Na and Cl atoms.
Initially, about 1.5 eV is required to transfer the electron from the Na to Cl atom
and thereby form Na+ and Cl− ions. Then, as the ions come together, the energy
is lowered, until it reaches a minimum at about 6.3 eV below the energy of the
separated Na and Cl atoms. When r = 0.28 nm, the energy is minimum and the

ions are in equilibrium. The bonding energy per ion in solid NaCl is thus 6.3∕2
or 3.15 eV, as is apparent in Figure 1.10. The energy required to take solid NaCl
apart into individual Na and Cl atoms is the atomic cohesive energy of the solid,
which is 3.15 eV per atom.
In solid NaCl, the Na+ and Cl− ions are thus arranged with each one having
oppositely charged ions as its neighbors, to attain a minimum of potential energy.
Since there is a size difference between the ions and since we must avoid like-ions

1.3

getting close to each other, if we want to achieve a stable structure, each ion can
have only six oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors. Figure 1.9b shows the
packing of Na+ and Cl− ions in the solid. The number of nearest neighbors, that is,
the coordination number, for both cations and anions in the NaCl crystal is 6.
A number of solids consisting of metal–nonmetal elements follow the NaCl
example and have ionic bonding. They are called ionic crystals and, by virtue of
their ionic bonding characteristics, share many physical properties. For example, LiF,
MgO (magnesia), CsCl, and ZnS are all ionic crystals. They are strong, brittle materials with high melting temperatures compared to metals. Most become soluble in
polar liquids such as water. Since all the electrons are within the rigidly positioned
ions, there are no free or loose electrons to wander around in the crystal as in metals.
Therefore, ionic solids are typically electrical insulators. Compared to metals and
covalently bonded solids, ionically bonded solids have lower thermal conductivity
since ions cannot readily pass vibrational kinetic energy to their neighbors.
The potential energy E per Na+–Cl− pair within
the NaCl crystal depends on the interionic separation r as

where the first term is the attractive and the second term is the repulsive potential energy,
and M, B, and m are constants explained in the following. If we were to consider the potential energy PE of one ion pair in isolation from all others, the first term would be a simple
Coulombic interaction energy for the Na+–Cl− pair, and M would be 1. Within the NaCl
crystal, however, a given ion, such as Na+, interacts not only with its nearest six Cl− neighbors
(Figure 1.9b), but also with its twelve second neighbors (Na+), eight third neighbors (Cl−),
and so on, so the total or effective PE has a factor M, called the Madelung constant, that
takes into account all these different Coulombic interactions. M depends only on the geometrical arrangement of ions in the crystal, and hence on the particular crystal structure; for
the FCC crystal structure, M = 1.748. The Na+–Cl− ion pair also has a repulsive PE that is
due to the repulsion between the electrons in filled electronic subshells of the ions. If the
ions are pushed toward each other, the filled subshells begin to overlap, which results in a
strong repulsion. The repulsive PE decays rapidly with distance and can be modeled by a
short-range PE of the form B∕rm as in the second term in Equation 1.4 where for Na+–Cl−,
m = 8 and B = 6.972 × 10−96 J m8. Find the equilibrium separation (ro) of the ions in the
crystal and the ionic bonding energy, defined as −E(ro). Given the ionization energy of Na
(the energy to remove an electron) is 5.14 eV and the electron affinity of Cl (energy released
when an electron is added) is 3.61 eV, calculate the atomic cohesive energy of the NaCl
crystal as joules per mole.

This is the energy with respect to two isolated Na+ and Cl− ions. We therefore need 7.84 eV
to break up a NaCl crystal into isolated Na+ and Cl− ions, which represents the ionic cohesive
energy. Some authors call this ionic cohesive energy simply the lattice energy. To take the
crystal apart into its neutral atoms, we have to transfer the electron from the Cl− ion to the Na+
ion to obtain neutral Na and Cl atoms. It takes 3.61 eV to remove the electron from the Cl− ion,
but 5.14 eV is released when it is put into the Na+ ion. Thus, we need 7.84 eV + 3.61 eV but
get back 5.14 eV.
Bond energy per Na–Cl pair = 7.84 eV + 3.61 eV − 5.14 eV = 6.31 eV

The atomic cohesive energy is 3.1 eV/atom. In terms of joules per mole of NaCl, this is
Ecohesive = (6.31 eV)(1.6022 × 10−19 J/eV)(6.022 × 1023 mol−1) = 608 kJ mol−1

1.3.5 SECONDARY BONDING
Covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds between atoms are known as primary bonds. It
may be thought that there should be no such bonding between the atoms of the inert
elements as they have full shells and therefore cannot accept or lose any electrons, nor
share any electrons. However, the fact that a solid phase of argon exists at low temperatures, below −189 °C, means that there must be some bonding mechanism between
the Ar atoms. The magnitude of this bond cannot be strong because above −189 °C
solid argon melts. Although each water molecule H2O is neutral overall, these molecules
nonetheless attract each other to form the liquid state below 100 °C and the solid state
below 0 °C. Between all atoms and molecules, there exists a weak type of attraction,
the so-called van der Waals–London force, which is due to a net electrostatic attraction
between the electron distribution of one atom and the positive nucleus of the other.
In many molecules, the concentrations of negative and positive charges do not
coincide. As apparent in the HCl molecule in Figure 1.11a, the electrons spend most

of their time around the Cl nucleus, so the positive nucleus of the H atom is exposed
(H has effectively donated its electron to the Cl atom) and the Cl-region acquires
more negative charge than the H-region. An electric dipole moment occurs whenever a negative and a positive charge of equal magnitude are separated by a distance
as in the H+–Cl− molecule in Figure 1.11a. Such molecules are polar, and depending on their relative orientations, they can attract or repel each other as depicted in
Figure 1.11b. Two dipoles arranged head to tail attract each other because the closest separation between charges on A and B is between the negative charge on A and
the positive charge on B, and the net result is an electrostatic attraction. The magnitude of the net force between two dipoles A and B, however, does not depend on
their separation r as 1∕r2 because there are both attractions and repulsions between
the charges on A and charges on B and the net force is only weakly attractive. (In
fact, the net force depends on 1∕r4.) If the dipoles are arranged head to head or tail
to tail, then, by similar arguments, the two dipoles repel each other. Suitably arranged
dipoles can attract each other and form van der Waals bonds as illustrated in Figure 1.11c. The energies of such dipole arrangements as in Figure 1.11c are less than
that of totally isolated dipoles and therefore encourage “bonding.” Such bonds are
weaker than primary bonds and are called secondary bonds.
The water molecule H2O is also polar and has a net dipole moment as shown
in Figure 1.12a. The attractions between the positive charges on one molecule and
the negative charges on a neighboring molecule lead to van der Waals bonding
between the H2O molecules in water as illustrated in Figure 1.12b. When the positive
charge of a dipole as in H2O arises from an exposed H nucleus, van der Waals bonding is referred to as hydrogen bonding. In ice, the H2O molecules, again attracted
by van der Waals forces, bond to form a regular pattern and hence a crystal structure.
Van der Waals attraction also occurs between neutral atoms and nonpolar molecules. Consider the bonding between Ne atoms at low temperatures. Each has closed
(or full) electron shells. The center of mass of the electrons in the closed shells,
when averaged over time, coincides with the location of the positive nucleus. At any
one instant, however, the center of mass is displaced from the nucleus due to various
motions of the individual electrons around the nucleus as depicted in Figure 1.13.
In fact, the center of mass of all the electrons fluctuates with time about the nucleus.

Consequently, the electron charge distribution is not static around the nucleus but
fluctuates asymmetrically, giving rise to an instantaneous dipole moment.
When two Ne atoms, A and B, approach each other, the rapidly fluctuating negative charge distribution on one affects the motion of the negative charge distribution
on the other. A lower energy configuration (i.e., attraction) is produced when the
fluctuations are synchronized so that the negative charge distribution on A gets closer
to the nucleus of the other, B, while the negative distribution on B at that instant
stays away from that on A as shown in Figure 1.13. The strongest electrostatic interaction arises from the closest charges that are the displaced electrons in A and the
nucleus in B. This means that there will be a net attraction between the two atoms
and hence a lowering of the net energy that in turn leads to bonding.
This type of attraction between two atoms is due to induced synchronization of
the electronic motions around the nuclei, and we refer to this as induced-dipole–
induced-dipole interaction. It is weaker than permanent dipole interactions and at
least an order of magnitude less than primary bonding. This is the reason why the
inert elements Ne and Ar solidify at temperatures below 25 K (−248 °C) and 84 K
(−189 °C). Induced dipole–induced dipole interactions also occur between nonpolar
molecules such as H2, I2, CH4, etc. Methane gas (CH4) can be solidified at very low
temperatures. Solids in which constituent molecules (or atoms) have been bonded by
van der Waals forces are known as molecular solids; ice, solidified CO2 (dry ice),
O2, H2, CH4, and solid inert gases are typical examples.

Van der Waals bonding is responsible for holding the carbon chains together in
polymers. Although the C-to-C bond in a C-chain is due to covalent bonding, the
interaction between the C-chains arises from van der Waals forces and the interchain
bonding is therefore of secondary nature. These bonds are weak and can be easily
stretched or broken. Polymers therefore have substantially lower elastic moduli and
melting temperatures than metals and ceramics.
Table 1.2 compares the energies involved in the five types of bonding found in
materials. It also lists some important properties of these materials to show the
correlation with the bond type and its energy. The greater is the bond energy, for
example, the higher is the melting temperature. Similarly, strong bond energies lead
to greater elastic moduli and smaller thermal expansion coefficients. Metals generally have the greatest electrical conductivity since only this type of bonding allows
a very large number of free charges (conduction electrons) to wander in the solid
and thereby contribute to electrical conduction. Electrical conduction in other types
of solid may involve the motion of ions or charged defects from one fixed location
to another.

22

CHAPTER 1

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

1.3.6 MIXED BONDING
In many solids, the bonding between atoms is generally not just of one type; rather,
it is a mixture of bond types. We know that bonding in the silicon crystal is totally
covalent, because the shared electrons in the bonds are equally attracted by the
neighboring positive ion cores and are therefore equally shared. When there is a
covalent-type bond between two different atoms, the electrons become unequally
shared, because the two neighboring ion cores are different and hence have different
electron-attracting abilities. The bond is no longer purely covalent; it has some ionic
character, because the shared electrons spend more time close to one of the ion cores.
Covalent bonds that have an ionic character, due to an unequal sharing of electrons,
are generally called polar bonds. Many technologically important semiconductor
materials, such as III–V compounds (e.g., GaAs), have polar covalent bonds. In
GaAs, for example, the electrons in a covalent bond spend slightly more time around
the As5+ ion core than the Ga3+ ion core.
Electronegativity is a relative measure of the ability of an atom to attract the
electrons in a bond it forms with another atom. The Pauling scale of electronegativity
assigns an electronegativity value X, a pure number, to various elements, the highest
being 4 for F, and the lowest values being for the alkali metal atoms, for which X
are less than 1. In this scheme, the difference XA − XB in the electronegativities of
two atoms A and B is a measure of the polar or ionic character of the bond A–B
between A and B. There is obviously no electronegativity difference for a covalent
bond. While it is possible to calculate the fractional ionicity of a single bond between
two different atoms using XA − XB, inside the crystal the overall ionic character can
be substantially higher because ions can interact with distant ions further away than
just the nearest neighbors, as we have found out in NaCl. Many technologically
important semiconductor materials, such as III–V compounds (e.g., GaAs) have polar
covalent bonds. In GaAs, for example, the bond in the crystal is about 30 percent
ionic in character (XAs − XGa = 2.18 − 1.81 = 0.37). In the ZnSe crystal, an important
II–VI semiconductor, the bond is 63 percent ionic (XSe − XZn = 2.55 − 1.65 = 0.85).7
Ceramic materials are compounds that generally contain metallic and nonmetallic elements. They are well known for their brittle mechanical properties, hardness,
high melting temperatures, and electrical insulating properties. The type of bonding
in a ceramic material may be covalent, ionic, or a mixture of the two, in which the
bond between the atoms involves some electron sharing and, to some extent, the
partial formation of cations and anions; the shared electrons spend more time with
one type of atom, which then becomes a partial anion while the other becomes a
partial cation. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), magnesia (MgO), and alumina (Al2O3) are all
ceramics, but they have different types of bonding: Si3N4 has covalent, MgO has
ionic, and Al2O3 has a mixture of ionic and covalent bonding. All three are brittle,
have high melting temperatures, and are electrical insulators.
7

Chemists use “Ionicity = 1 − exp[0.24(XA − XB)]” to calculate the ionicity of the bond between A and B. While
this is undoubtedly useful in identifying the trend, it substantially underestimates the actual ionicity of bonding
within the crystal itself. (It is left as an exercise to show this fact from the above XA and XB values.) The quoted
ionicity percentages are from J. C. Phillips’ book Bonds and Bands in Semiconductors, New York: Academic
Press, 1973. By the way, the units of X are sometimes quoted as Pauling units, after its originator Linus Pauling.

BONDING AND TYPES OF SOLIDS

ENERGY OF SECONDARY BONDING Consider the van der Waals bonding in solid argon.
The potential energy as a function of interatomic separation can generally be modeled by the
Lennard–Jones 6–12 potential energy curve, that is,

where A and B are constants. Given that A = 8.0 × 10−77 J m6 and B = 1.12 × 10−133 J m12,
calculate the bond length and bond energy (in eV) for solid argon.
SOLUTION

Bonding occurs when the potential energy is at a minimum. We therefore differentiate
the Lennard–Jones potential E(r) and set it to zero at r = ro, the interatomic equilibrium

Notice how small this energy is compared to primary bonding.
The elastic modulus, or Young’s modulus Y, of a solid indicates its
ability to deform elastically. The greater is the elastic modulus, the more effort is required
for the same amount of elastic deformation given a constant sample geometry. When a solid
is subjected to tensile forces F acting on two opposite faces, as in Figure 1.14a, it experiences
a stress σ defined as the force per unit area F∕A, where A is the area on which F acts. If
the original length of the specimen is Lo, then the applied stress σ stretches the solid by an
amount δL. The strain ε is the fractional increase in the length of the solid δL∕Lo. As long
as the applied force displaces the atoms in the solid by a small amount from their equilibrium
positions, the deformation is elastic and recoverable when the forces are removed. The applied
stress σ and the resulting elastic strain ε are related by the elastic modulus Y by

Figure 1.14 (a) Applied forces F stretch the solid elastically from Lo to Lo + δL. The force is divided
among chains of atoms that make the solid. Each chain carries a force δFN. (b) In equilibrium, the applied
force is balanced by the net force δFN between the atoms as a result of their increased separation.

The applied stress causes two neighboring atoms along the direction of force to be further separated. Their displacement δr (= r − ro) results in a net attractive force δFN between
two neighboring atoms as indicated in Figure 1.14b (which is the same as Figure 1.3a) where
FN is the net interatomic force. δFN attempts to restore the separation to equilibrium. This
force δFN, however, is balanced by a portion of the applied force acting on these atoms as in
Figure 1.14a. If we were to proportion the area A in Figure 1.14a among all the atoms on
this area, each atom would have an area roughly r 2o. (If there are N atoms on A, Nr 2o = A.)
The force δFN is therefore σr 2o. The strain ε is δr∕ro. Thus, Equation 1.7 gives

constant. Thus Y = β∕ro.
Solids with higher bond energies therefore tend to have higher elastic moduli as apparent
in Table 1.2. Secondary bonding has both a smaller Ebond and a larger ro than primary bonding
and Y is much smaller. For NaCl, from Figure 1.10, Ebond = 6.3 eV, ro = 0.28 nm, and Y is of
the order of ∼45 GPa using Equation 1.9 and γ ≈ 1, and not far out from the value in Table 1.2.

KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY

1.4.1 MEAN KINETIC ENERGY AND TEMPERATURE
The kinetic molecular theory of matter is a classical theory that can explain such seemingly diverse topics as the pressure of a gas, the heat capacity of metals, the average
speed of electrons in a semiconductor, and electrical noise in resistors, among many
interesting phenomena. We start with the kinetic molecular theory of gases, which
considers a collection of gas molecules in a container and applies the classical equations of motion from elementary mechanics to these molecules. We assume that the
collisions between the gas molecules and the walls of the container result in the gas
pressure P. Newton’s second law, dp∕dt = force, where p = mv is the momentum, is
used to relate the pressure P (force per unit area) to the mean square velocity v 2 , and
the number of molecules per unit volume N∕V. The result can be stated simply as
1
PV = Nmv2
3

[1.10]

where m is the mass of the gas molecule. Comparing this theoretical derivation with
the experimental observation that
PV = (

N
RT
NA )

where NA is Avogadro’s number and R is the gas constant, we can relate the mean
kinetic energy of the molecules to the temperature. Our objective is to derive Equation 1.10; to do so, we make the following assumptions:
1. The molecules are in constant random motion. Since we are considering a large
number of molecules, perhaps 1020 m−3, there are as many molecules traveling in
one direction as in any other direction, so the center of mass of the gas is at rest.
2. The range of intermolecular forces is short compared to the average separation
of the gas molecules. Consequently,
a. Intermolecular forces are negligible, except during a collision.
b. The volume of the gas molecules (all together) is negligible compared to
the volume occupied by the gas (i.e., the container).
3. The duration of a collision is negligible compared to the time spent in free
motion between collisions.
4. Each molecule moves with uniform velocity between collisions, and the acceleration due to the gravitational force or other external forces is neglected.
5. On average, the collisions of the molecules with one another and with the walls
of the container are perfectly elastic. Collisions between molecules result in
exchanges of kinetic energy.
6. Newtonian mechanics can be applied to describe the motion of the molecules.
We consider a collection of N gas molecules within a cubic container of side a.
We focus our attention on one of the molecules moving toward one of the walls.
The velocity can be decomposed into two components, one directly toward the wall

vx, and the other parallel to the wall vy, as shown in Figure 1.15. Clearly, the collision of the molecule, which is perfectly elastic, does not change the component vy
along the wall, but reverses the perpendicular component vx. The change in the
momentum of the molecule following its collision with the wall is
Δp = 2mvx

where m is the mass of the molecule. Following its collision, the molecule travels
back across the box, collides with the opposite face B, and returns to hit face A
again. The time interval Δt is the time to traverse twice the length of the box, or
Δt = 2a∕vx. Thus, every Δt seconds, the molecule collides with face A and changes
its momentum by 2mvx. To find the force F exerted by this molecule on face A, we
need the rate of change of momentum, or

that is,

where v 2x is the average of v 2x for all the molecules and is called the mean square

same as those in the y and z directions, or
v 2x = v 2y = v 2z

For any molecule, the velocity v is given by
v 2 = v 2x + v 2y + v 2z = 3v 2x

The relationship between the pressure P and the mean square velocity of the
molecules is therefore

where ρ is the density of the gas, or Nm∕V. By using elementary mechanical concepts, we have now related the pressure exerted by the gas to the number of molecules per unit volume and to the mean square of the molecular velocity.
Equation 1.11 can be written explicitly to show the dependence of PV on the
mean kinetic energy of the molecules. Rearranging Equation 1.11, we obtain
PV =

where R is the universal gas constant. Comparing this equation with the kinetic

where k = R∕NA is called the Boltzmann constant. Thus, the mean square velocity

kinetic theory, and we will use it frequently.
When heat is added to a gas, its internal energy and, by virtue of Equation 1.12,
its temperature both increase. The rise in the internal energy per unit temperature
is called the heat capacity. If we consider 1 mole of gas, then the heat capacity is
called the molar heat capacity Cm. The total internal energy U of 1 mole of monatomic gas (i.e., a gas with only one atom in each molecule) is

Thus, the heat capacity per mole of a monatomic gas at constant volume is
simply 32 R. By comparison, we will see later that the heat capacity of metals is twice
this amount. The reason for considering constant volume is that the heat added to
the system then increases the internal energy without doing mechanical work by
expanding the volume.8
There is a useful theorem called Maxwell’s principle of equipartition of
energy, which assigns an average of 12 kT to each independent energy term in the
expression for the total energy of a system. A monatomic molecule can only have
translational kinetic energy, which is the sum of kinetic energies in the x, y, and z
directions. The total energy is therefore
E=

1 2 1 2 1 2
mv x + mv y + mv z
2
2
2

Each of these terms represents an independent way in which the molecule can
be made to absorb energy. Each method by which a system can absorb energy is
called a degree of freedom. A monatomic molecule has only three degrees of freedom. According to Maxwell’s principle, for a collection of molecules in thermal
equilibrium, each degree of freedom has an average energy of 12 kT , so the average
kinetic energy of the monatomic molecule is 3( 12 kT).
A rigid diatomic molecule (such as an O2 molecule) can acquire energy as
translational motion and rotational motion, as depicted in Figure 1.16. Assuming the
moment of inertia Ix about the molecular axis (along x) is negligible, the energy of
the molecule is
E=

The heat capacity of a substance may be at constant volume or constant pressure, denoted CV and CP,

where Iy and Iz are moments of inertia about the y and z axes and ωy and ωz are
angular velocities about the y and z axes (Figure 1.16).
This molecule has five degrees of freedom and hence an average energy of
5( 12 kT). Its molar heat capacity is therefore 52 R.
The atoms in the molecule will also vibrate by stretching or bending the bond,
which behaves like a “spring.” At room temperature, the addition of heat generally
results in the translational and rotational motions becoming more energetic (excited),
whereas the molecular vibrations remain the same and therefore do not absorb
energy. This occurs because the vibrational energy of the molecule can only change
in finite steps; in other words, the vibrational energy is quantized. For many molecules, the energy required to excite a more energetic vibration is much more than
the energy possessed by the majority of molecules. Therefore, energy exchanges via
molecular collisions cannot readily excite more energetic vibrations; consequently,
the contribution of molecular vibrations to the heat capacity at room temperature
is negligible.9
In a solid, the atoms are bonded to each other and can only move by vibrating
about their equilibrium positions. In the simplest view, a typical atom in a solid is
joined to its neighbors by “springs” that represent the bonds, as depicted in Figure 1.17. If we consider a given atom, its potential energy as a function of displacement from the equilibrium position is such that if it is displaced slightly in any
direction, it will experience a restoring force proportional to the displacement. Thus,
this atom can acquire energy by vibrations in three directions. The energy associated
with the x direction, for example, is the kinetic energy of vibration plus the potential
energy of the “spring,” or 12 mv 2x + 12 Kx x2 , where vx is the velocity, x is the extension
of the spring, and Kx is the spring constant, all along the x direction. Clearly, there
9
At sufficiently high temperatures, it is indeed possible to excite molecular vibrations. At such high temperatures,
there are two additional energy terms arising from vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy (stretching
and compressing the bond). Each, on average, has (1∕2)kT of energy so that Cm = (7∕2)R. See Question 1.14.

We know that for simple harmonic motion, the average KE is equal to the average PE. Since, by virtue of the equipartition of energy principle, each average KE

This is the Dulong–Petit rule for the molar heat capacity of a solid.10 We can also

the heat capacity.

[1.15]

The kinetic molecular theory of matter is one of the successes of classical physics, with a beautiful simplicity in its equations and predictions. Its failures, however,
are numerous. For example, the theory fails to predict that, at low temperatures, the
heat capacity increases as T 3 and that the resistivity of a metal increases linearly
with the absolute temperature. We will explain the origins of these phenomena in
Chapter 4.
Calculate the root mean square (rms) velocity of nitrogen molecules in atmospheric air at 27 °C. Also calculate the root mean square velocity in one direction

which is slightly less than the velocity of sound in air (350 m s−1). The difference is due to
the fact that the propagation of a sound wave involves rapid compressions and rarefactions
of air, and the result is that the propagation is not isothermal. Note that accounting for oxygen
in air lowers vrms,x. (Why?)

SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY OF A METAL Estimate the specific heat capacity of copper,
that is the heat capacity per unit gram, given that its atomic mass Mat is 63.6 g mol−1 and
compare with the experimental value of 0.387 J g−1 K−1.

From the Dulong–Petit rule, Cm = 3 R for NA atoms. Since NA atoms have a mass of Mat

Clearly the predicted value is very close to the experimental value. Nearly all metals at room
temperature follow the Dulong–Petit rule. It is left as an exercise to pick a light nonmetal
elemental solid such as Si and show that the Dulong–Petit rule completely fails at room
temperature.

SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY OF A COMPOUND Consider a compound such as AaBb. This

could be a CdTe crystal in which A = Cd, B = Te, and a = b = 1. Consider a mass m grams

amount of heat capacity cat to the solid so that the total heat capacity of m grams is (aNA +
bNA)cat = (a + b)NA(3k) = (a + b)(3R). If MA is the atomic mass of A, then NA atoms of A
have a mass MA grams; and similarly for B. The mass of m in grams is simply aMA + bMB.
Thus, the specific heat capacity is

1.4.2 THERMAL EXPANSION
Nearly all materials expand as the temperature increases. This phenomenon is due
to the asymmetric nature of the interatomic forces and the increase in the amplitude
of atomic vibrations with temperature as expected from the kinetic molecular theory.
The potential energy curve U(r) for two atoms separated by a distance r is shown
in Figure 1.18. In equilibrium the PE is a minimum at Umin = −Uo and the bonding
energy is simply Uo. The atoms are separated by the equilibrium separation ro. However, according to the kinetic molecular theory, atoms are vibrating about their equilibrium positions with a mean vibrational kinetic energy that increases with the
temperature as 32 kT . At any instant the total energy E of the pair of atoms is U + KE,
and this is constant inasmuch as no external forces are being applied. The atoms will
be vibrating about their equilibrium positions, stretching and compressing the bond,
as depicted in Figure 1.19. At positions B and C, U is maximum and the KE is zero;
the atoms are stationary and about to reverse their direction of oscillation. Thus at
B and C the total energy E = UB = UC and the PE has increased from its minimum
value Umin by an amount equal to KE. The line BC corresponds to the total energy
E. The atoms are confined to vibrate between B and C, executing simple harmonic
motion and hence maintaining E = U + KE = constant.
But the PE curve U(r) is asymmetric. U(r) is broader in the r > ro region. Thus,
the atoms spend more time in the r > ro region, that is, more time stretching the
bond than compressing the bond (with respect to the equilibrium length ro). The
average separation corresponds to point A,

Because of thermal energy, the atoms will be vibrating and will have vibrational kinetic

and compressed by an amount corresponding to the KE of the atoms. A pair of atoms will
be vibrating between B and C. Their average separation will be at A and greater than ro.
At temperature T2, the KE is larger and the atoms vibrate between B′ and C′.

We consider for simplicity a pair of atoms. Total

harmonic motion. At B and C, KE is zero (atoms
are stationary and about to reverse direction of
oscillation) and PE is maximum.

which is clearly greater than ro. As the temperature increases, KE increases, the total
energy E increases, and the atoms vibrate between wider extremes of the U(r) curve,
between B′ and C′. The new average separation at A′ is now greater than that at
A: rA′ > rA. Thus as the temperature increases, the average separation between the
atoms also increases, which leads to the phenomenon of thermal expansion. If the
PE curve were symmetric, then there would be no thermal expansion as the atoms
would spend equal times in the r < ro and r > ro regions.

CHAPTER 1

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

When the temperature increases by a small amount δT, the energy per atom
increases by cat δT where cat is the heat capacity per atom (molar heat capacity
divided by NA). If cat δT is large, then the line B′C′ in Figure 1.18 will be higher up
on the energy curve and the average separation A′ will therefore be larger. Thus, the
increase δrav in the average separation is proportional to δT. If the total length Lo is
made up of N atoms, Lo = Nrav, then the change δL in Lo is proportional to N δT or
Lo δT. The proportionality constant is the thermal coefficient of linear expansion,
or simply, thermal expansion coefficient λ, which is defined as the fractional
change in length per unit temperature,11

[1.17]

We note that λ is a material property that depends on the nature of the bond.
The variation of rav with T in Figure 1.18 depends on the shape of the PE curve
U(r). Typically, λ is larger for metallic bonding than for covalent bonding.
We can use a mathematical procedure (known as a Taylor expansion) to describe
the U(r) versus r curve in terms of its minimum value Umin, plus correction terms
that depend on the powers of the displacement (r − ro) from ro, that is
U(r) = Umin + a2(r − ro)2 + a3(r − ro)3 + ⋯

[1.18]

where a2 and a3 are coefficients that are related to the second and third derivatives of
U at ro. The term a1(r − ro) is missing because dU∕dr = 0 at r = ro where U = Umin.
The Umin and a2(r − ro)2 terms in Equation 1.18 give a parabola about Umin which
is a symmetric curve around ro and therefore does not lead to thermal expansion.
The average location at any energy on a symmetric curve at ro is always at ro. It is
the a3 term that gives the expansion because it leads to asymmetry. Thus, λ depends
on the amount of asymmetry, that is, a3∕a2. The asymmetric PE curve in Figure 1.18
which has a finite cubic a3 term as in Equation 1.18 does not lead to a perfect
simple harmonic (sinusoidal) vibration about ro because the restoring force is not
proportional to the displacement alone. Such oscillations are unharmonic, and the
PE curve is said to possess an unharmonicity (terms such as a3). Thermal expansion
is an unharmonic effect.
The thermal expansion coefficient normally depends on the temperature, λ = λ(T),
and typically increases with increasing temperature, except at the lowest temperatures.
We can always expand λ(T) about some useful temperature such as To to obtain a
polynomial series in temperature terms up to the most significant term, usually the T 2
11
Physicists tend to define λ in terms of the instantaneous length L at T, rather than the original length Lo at To,
that is, (1∕L)(dL∕dT) = λ, which is often called the instantaneous thermal expansion coefficient, whereas that in
Equation 1.16 is the engineering definition. For all practical extensions (in which ΔL∕Lo is very small), the two
definitions are the same. Nearly all practical measurements of λ are based on the engineering definition. (Why?)

[1.19]

where A, B, and C are temperature-independent constants, and the expansion is
about To. To find the total fractional change in the length ΔL∕Lo from To to T, we
have to integrate λ(T) with respect to temperature from To to T. We can still employ
Equation 1.17 provided that we use a properly defined mean value for the expansion
coefficient from To to T,

(near the melting temperature), for most metals λ does not depend strongly on the

and the heat capacity of a material, which is discussed in Chapter 4.

Aluminum has a density of 2.70 g cm at 25 °C. Its thermal expansion coefficient is
24 × 10−6 °C−1. Calculate the density of Al at 350 °C.
SOLUTION

Consider the solid body in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped with sides xo, yo, and zo.
Then at To,
Vo = xoyozo

and at T,

V = [xo(1 + λ ΔT)][yo(1 + λ ΔT)][zo(1 + λ ΔT)]
= xoyozo(1 + λ ΔT)3
V = xoyozo[1 + 3λ ΔT + 3λ2(ΔT )2 + λ3(ΔT)3]

that is

We can now use Vo = xoyozo, and neglect the λ2(ΔT )2 and λ3(ΔT )3 terms compared
with the λ ΔT term (λ ≪ 1) and also use Equation 1.22 to obtain,
V = Vo[1 + 3λ(T − To)] = Vo[1 + αV (T − To)]

Since density ρ is mass/volume, volume expansion leads to a density reduction. Thus,
ρ=

≈ ρo [1 − αV (T − To ) ]

For Al, the density at 350 °C is

MOLECULAR VELOCITY AND ENERGY
DISTRIBUTION

Although the kinetic theory allows us to determine the root mean square velocity
of the gas molecules, it says nothing about the distribution of velocities. Due to
random collisions between the molecules and the walls of the container and
between the molecules themselves, the molecules do not all have the same velocity. The velocity distribution of molecules can be determined experimentally by
the simple scheme illustrated in Figure 1.21. Gas molecules are allowed to escape
from a small aperture of a hot oven in which the substance is vaporized. Two
blocking slits allow only those molecules that are moving along the line through
the two slits to pass through, which results in a collimated beam. This beam is
directed toward two rotating disks, which have slightly displaced slits. The molecules that pass through the first slit can only pass through the second if they have
a certain speed; that is, the exact speed at which the second slit lines up with the
first slit. Thus, the two disks act as a speed selector. The speed of rotation of
the disks determines which molecular speeds are allowed to go through. The experiment therefore measures the number of molecules ΔN with speeds in the range v
to (v + Δv).

It is generally convenient to describe the number of molecules dN with speeds
in a certain range v to (v + dv) by defining a velocity density function nv as follows:
dN = nv dv

Maxwell–
Boltzmann

speeds

where nv is the number of molecules per unit velocity that have velocities in the
range v to (v + dv). This number represents the velocity distribution among the
molecules and is a function of the molecular velocity nv = nv(v). From the experiment, we can easily obtain nv by nv = ΔN∕Δv at various velocities. Figure 1.22
shows the velocity density function nv of nitrogen gas at two temperatures. The
average (vav), most probable (v*), and rms (vrms) speeds are marked to show their
relative positions. As expected, all these speeds increase with increasing temperature.
From various experiments of the type shown in Figure 1.21, the velocity distribution
function nv has been widely studied and found to obey the following equation:
nv = 4πN(

velocities in thermal equilibrium. The function assumes that the particles do not
interact with each other while in motion and that all the collisions are elastic in the
sense that they involve an exchange of kinetic energy. Figure 1.22 clearly shows that
molecules move around randomly, with a variety of velocities ranging from nearly
zero to almost infinity. The kinetic theory speaks of their rms value only.
What is the energy distribution of molecules in a gas? In the case of a monatomic gas, the total energy E is purely translational kinetic energy, so we can use
E = 21 mv2 . To relate an energy range dE to a velocity range dv, we have dE = mv dv.
Suppose that nE is the number of atoms per unit volume per unit energy at an energy E.
Then nE dE is the number of atoms with energies in the range E to (E + dE). These
are also the atoms with velocities in the range v to (v + dv), because an atom with
a velocity v has an energy E. Thus,
nE dE = nv dv

i.e.,

nE = nv(

dv
dE )

If we substitute for nv and (dv∕dE), we obtain the expression for nE as a function
of E:

Thus, the total internal energy is distributed among the atoms according to the
Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution in Equation 1.26. The exponential factor exp(−E∕kT)
is called the Boltzmann factor. Atoms have widely differing kinetic energies, but a
mean energy of 32 kT . Figure 1.23 shows the Maxwell–Boltzmann energy distribution
among the gas atoms in a tank at two temperatures. As the temperature increases,
the distribution extends to higher energies. The area under the curve is the total
number of molecules, which remains the same for a closed container.
Equation 1.26 represents the energy distribution among the N gas atoms at any
time. Since the atoms are continually colliding and exchanging energies, the energy
of one atom will sometimes be small and sometimes be large, but averaged over a

long time, this energy will be 32 kT as long as all the gas atoms are in thermal equilibrium (i.e., the temperature is the same everywhere in the gas). We can therefore
also use Equation 1.26 to represent all possible energies an atom can acquire over a
long period. There are a total of N atoms, and nE dE of them have energies in the
range E to (E + dE). Thus,
Probability of energy being in E to (E + dE) =

nE dE
N

[1.27]

When the probability in Equation 1.27 is integrated (i.e., summed) for all energies
(E = 0 to ∞), the result is unity, because the atom must have an energy somewhere
in the range of zero to infinity.
What happens to the Maxwell–Boltzmann energy distribution law in Equation 1.26
when the total energy is not simply translational kinetic energy? What happens when
we do not have a monatomic gas? Suppose that the total energy of a molecule (which
may simply be an atom) in a system of N molecules has vibrational and rotational
kinetic energy contributions, as well as potential energy due to intermolecular interactions. In all cases, the number of molecules per unit energy nE turns out to contain
the Boltzmann factor, and the energy distribution obeys what is called the Boltzmann
energy distribution:

where E is the total energy (KE + PE), N is the total number of molecules in the
system, and C is a constant that relates to the specific system (e.g., a monatomic gas
or a liquid). The constant C may depend on the energy E, as in Equation 1.26, but
not as strongly as the exponential term. Equation 1.28 is the probability per unit
energy that a molecule in a given system has an energy E. Put differently, (nE dE)∕N
is the fraction of molecules in a small energy range E to E + dE.
MEAN AND RMS SPEEDS OF MOLECULES Given the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
law for the velocities of molecules in a gas, derive expressions for the mean speed (vav), most
probable speed (v*), and rms velocity (vrms) of the molecules and calculate the corresponding
values for a gas of noninteracting electrons.

Differentiating nv with respect to v and setting this to zero, dnv∕dv = 0, gives the position

Substituting m = 9.1 × 10−31 kg for electrons and using T = 300 K, we find v* =
95.3 km s−1, vav = 108 km s−1, and vrms = 117 km s−1, all of which are close in value. We
often use the term thermal velocity to describe the mean speed of particles due to their thermal random motion. Also, the integrations shown above are not trivial and they involve
substitution and integration by parts.

1.6

MOLECULAR COLLISIONS AND
VACUUM DEPOSITION

Consider an example in which a tank contains only nitrogen gas. Suppose that we
wish to find how far a molecule in this gas travels before it collides with another
molecule. Each molecule has a finite size, which can be roughly represented by a
sphere of radius of r. The mean free path ℓ is defined as the mean distance a gas
molecule travels before it collides with another molecule as illustrated in Figure 1.24a.
We are interested in the mean free path of an N2 molecule. If we consider the motion
of say one N2 molecule with all the others stationary, then it is apparent that if the
path of the traveling molecule crosses the cross-sectional area S = π(2r)2 then there
will be a collision. Since ℓ is the mean distance between collisions, it is apparent
that there must be at least one stationary molecule within the cylindrical volume Sℓ
as shown in Figure 1.24a. If n is the concentration of molecules in the gas, we must
therefore have nSℓ = nπ(2r)2ℓ = 1 or ℓ = 1∕(4πr2n). This must be corrected for the

sample (such as a crystal) to fabricate an electrical contact between the gold and
semiconductor crystal. The deposition process is generally carried out in a vacuum
chamber as shown in Figure 1.24b. It involves the condensation of Au atoms from
the vapor phase onto a substrate, which is the semiconductor crystal. In one simple
deposition technique, as in Figure 1.24b, a resistively (or directly) heated boat, made
from a refractory metal such as tungsten or molybdenum, is used. The evaporant,
such as pieces of gold, is loaded into the boat and then the boat is heated by passing
a large current. The gold pieces in the boat melt and gold atoms are vaporized from
this melt. The evaporated gold atoms leave the boat in straight trajectories and
impinge on the substrate; that is, they condense onto the semiconductor sample’s
surface to solidify and form a gold film. It is clear that the vacuum deposition relies
on maintaining a long mean free path between molecular collisions. Unless the mean
free path ℓ for the gold atoms is very long, then these atoms would simply collide
with the air molecules, and not reach the target. Thus, ℓ should be much longer than
the distance L from the boat to the substrate. In this example, the source material
(gold) was evaporated and the atoms were condensed onto the surface of a substrate
(a semiconductor crystal) by thermal evaporation, or physical vapor deposition
(PVD). While the above example was on depositing a metal film, many other materials such as semiconductors, oxides, and polymers can also be deposited as thin
film by using PVD. Other vacuum deposition techniques are needed when the
source material cannot be evaporated easily to form the required film on the substrate. Electron beam evaporation is one such technique and is described later in
Section 1.12.2.
The simple expression in Equation 1.29 does not consider the case when there
is a mixture of different types of molecules so that there are also collisions between
different species of molecules. For example, the air in the chamber will have both
N2 and O2 molecules, with different partial pressures. O2 and N2 molecules will collide with each other. Further, when Au atoms leave the tungsten surface in a trajectory toward the substrate, they can collide with N2 or O2 molecules, so there are
three different molecular collisions involved.

PRESSURE FOR PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION We will estimate typical pressures that
are needed to carry out a vacuum deposition of a thin film on a substrate as in Figure 1.24b.
For simplicity, we will take air to be only N2 for calculations. First, we need the concentration from the pressure P of N2 gas inside the chamber at atmospheric pressure, P = 1 atm =
1.013 × 105 Pa. If N is the total number of molecules and V is the chamber volume, then

EXAMPLE 1.12

where R = kNA. The concentration n is defined as n = N∕V so that substituting for N in the

which is very short. Suppose that the filament to substrate distance L is 20 cm and we would
like ℓ to be at least 50L to avoid Au atoms colliding with the N2 molecules. Substituting
Equation 1.29 into Equation 1.30, we find

Typically, pressures on the order of 10−6 torr are considered to be sufficient for vacuum
deposition by thermal evaporation. We should have strictly considered the size of both Au
and N2 atoms and their relative speeds in a more rigorous calculation but P as an order of
magnitude would not have been too different.

Consider a vacuum deposition process in
which atoms will be deposited onto a substrate. We wish to calculate the rate of impingement

in Figure 1.24c. Put differently, we wish to calculate the flux of molecules arriving on the
area A. Suppose that ΔN number of molecules reach the area A in time Δt as shown in Figure 1.24c. The flux density Γ that characterizes the flow rate of such particles per unit area
is generally defined by
PARTICLE FLUX DENSITY AND PRESSURE

[1.32]

It is clear in Figure 1.24c that only those molecules with a velocity component along
the positive x-direction can reach A. Suppose that the average speed parallel to the x-direction
is vx. In a time interval Δt, those molecules will travel vxΔt along x. Only those molecules
that are a distance vxΔt away from A and also within the area A can reach A as shown in
Figure 1.24d. The number of these molecules in the volume AvxΔt is n(AvxΔt), where n is
the number of molecules per unit volume. However, only half of these will be moving along
+x and the other half along −x, so the actual ΔN reaching A is 12 nAvx Δt. Substituting this

by N2 molecules, assuming that an atom on the surface is roughly a square with a side a on
the order of 0.2 nm? Assume the temperature is 300 K. What is your conclusion?

(6.022 × 10 mol ) = 4.65 × 10 kg. Substituting T = 300 K, we find the rms velocity
along x, vx(rms) = 298.5 m s−1.
We have already calculated the N2 concentration n under a pressure of 1 atm in the
chamber in Example 1.12 by using Equation 1.30, that is, n = 2.45 × 1025 m−3.
The flux density of N2 molecules impinging on the substrate is then

A typical size a of an atom is on the order of 0.2 nm so that an atom on the surface of a
substrate typically occupies an area a2 of 0.04 nm2 or 4 × 10−20 m2. A particular atom on the
surface is then bombarded at a rate a2Γx per second, that is, (4 × 10−20 m2)(3.65 × 1027 m−2 s−1)
or 146 million times every second.
If we repeat the calculations at a pressure of 10−9 torr (1.33 × 10−7 Pa), we would find
that n = 3.22 × 1013 m−3 and Γx = 4.8 × 1015 m−2 s−1 so that a particular atom on the substrate surface is hit 1.9 × 10−4 times per second, or it takes 1.4 hours for this atom to be hit
by an N2 molecule. It is obvious that at atmospheric pressure we cannot deposit the evaporant
atoms onto the substrate while the substrate is bombarded at an astronomic rate. On the other
hand, under suitable vacuum conditions, we can easily deposit evaporant atoms and grow the
layer we need on the substrate without air and other contaminant molecules interfering with
the growth.

HEAT, THERMAL FLUCTUATIONS, AND NOISE

Generally, thermal equilibrium between two objects implies that they have the same
temperature, where temperature (from the kinetic theory) is a measure of the mean
kinetic energy of the molecules. Consider a solid in a monatomic gas atmosphere
such as He gas, as depicted in Figure 1.25. Both the gas and the solid are at the
same temperature. The gas molecules move around randomly, with a mean kinetic
energy given by 12 mv2 = 23 kT , where m is the mass of the gas molecule. We also know
that the atoms in the solid vibrate with a mean kinetic energy given by 12 MV 2 = 32 kT,
where M is the mass of the solid atom and V is the velocity of vibration. The gas
molecules will collide with the atoms on the surface of the solid and will thus

exchange energy with those solid atoms. Since both are at the same temperature, the
solid atoms and gas molecules have the same mean kinetic energy, which means that
over a long time, there will be no net transfer of energy from one to the other. This
is basically what we mean by thermal equilibrium.
If, on the other hand, the solid is hotter than the gas, Tsolid > Tgas, and thus
1
2
MV
> 21 mv2 , then when an average gas molecule and an average solid atom col2
lide, energy will be transferred from the solid atom to the gas molecule. As many
more gas molecules collide with solid atoms, more and more energy will be transferred, until the mean kinetic energy of atoms in each substance is the same and
they reach the same temperature: the bodies have equilibrated. The amount of
energy transferred from the kinetic energy of the atoms in the hot solid to the kinetic
energy of the gas molecules is called heat. Heat represents the energy transfer from
the hot body to the cold body by virtue of the random motions and collisions of the
atoms and molecules.
Although, over a long time, the energy transferred between two systems in thermal
equilibrium is certainly zero, this does not preclude a net energy transfer from one to
the other at one instant. For example, at any one instant, an average solid atom may
be hit by a fast gas molecule with a speed at the far end of the Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution. There will then be a transfer of energy from the gas molecule to the solid
atom. At another instant, a slow gas molecule hits the solid, and the reverse is true.
Thus, although the mean energy transferred from one atom to the other is zero, the
instantaneous value of this energy is not zero and varies randomly about zero.
As an example, consider a small mass attached to a spring, as illustrated in
Figure 1.26. The gas or air molecules will bombard and exchange energy with the
solid atoms. Some air molecules will be fast and some will be slow, which means
that there will be an instantaneous exchange of energy. Consequently, the spring will
be compressed when the bombarding air molecules are fast (more energetic) and
extended when they are less energetic. This leads to a mechanical fluctuation of the
mass about its equilibrium position, as depicted in Figure 1.26. These fluctuations
make the measurement of the exact position of the mass uncertain, and it is futile
to try to measure the position more accurately than these fluctuations permit.

If the mass m compresses the spring by Δx, then at time t, the energy stored as
potential energy in the spring is
PE(t) =

[1.34]

where K is the spring constant. At a later instant, this energy will be returned to the
gas by the spring. The spring will continue to fluctuate because of the fluctuations
in the velocity of the bombarding air molecules. Over a long period, the average
value of PE will be the same as KE and, by virtue of the Maxwell equipartition of
energy theorem, it will be given by

Thus, the rms value of the fluctuations of the mass about its equilibrium position is
(Δx) rms = √

[1.36]

To understand the origin of electrical noise, for example, we consider the thermal fluctuations in the instantaneous local electron concentration in a conductor,
such as that shown in Figure 1.27. Because of fluctuations in the electron concentration at any one instant, end A of the conductor can become more negative with
respect to end B, which will give rise to a voltage across the conductor. This fluctuation in the electron concentration is due to more electrons at that instant moving
toward end A than toward B. At a later instant, the situation reverses and more
electrons move toward B than toward A, resulting in end B becoming more negative
and leading to a reversal of the voltage between A and B. Clearly, there will therefore be voltage fluctuations across the conductor, even though the mean voltage
across it over a long period is always zero. If the conductor is connected to an
amplifier, these voltage fluctuations will be amplified and recorded as noise at the
output. This noise corrupts the actual signal at the amplifier input and is obviously
undesirable. As engineers, we have to know how to calculate the magnitude of this
noise. Although the mean voltage due to thermal fluctuations is zero, the rms value
is not. The average voltage from a power outlet is zero, but the rms value is 120 V.
We use the rms value to calculate the amount of average power available.
Consider a conductor of resistance R. To derive the noise voltage generated by
R we place a capacitor C across this conductor, as in Figure 1.28, and we assume
that both are at the same temperature; they are in thermal equilibrium. The capacitor
is placed as a convenient device to obtain or derive the noise voltage generated by
R. It should be emphasized that C itself does not contribute to the source of the
fluctuations (it generates no noise) but is inserted into the circuit to impose a finite
bandwidth over which we will calculate the noise voltage. The reason is that all
practical electric circuits have some kind of bandwidth, and the noise voltage we
will derive depends on this bandwidth. Even if we remove the capacitor, there will
still be stray capacitances; and if we short the conductor, the shorting wires will have
some inductance that will also impose a bandwidth. As we mentioned previously,

thermal fluctuations in the conductor give rise to voltage fluctuations across R. There
is only so much average energy available in these thermal fluctuations, and this is
the energy that is used to charge and discharge the external capacitor C. The voltage
v across the capacitor depends on how much energy that can be stored on it, which
in turn depends on the thermal fluctuations in the conductor. Charging a capacitor
to a voltage v implies that an energy E = 21 Cv2 is stored on the capacitor. The mean
stored energy E in a thermal equilibrium system can only be 12 kT , according to the
Maxwell energy equipartition theorem. Thus E(t), the mean energy stored on C due
to thermal fluctuations, is given by

Interestingly, the rms noise voltage across an RC network seems to be independent of the resistance. However, the origin of the noise voltage arises from the
electron fluctuations in the conductor and we must somehow re-express Equation 1.37
to reflect this fact; that is, we must relate the electrical fluctuations to R.
The voltage fluctuations across the network will have many sinusoidal components, but only those below the cutoff frequency of the RC network will contribute
to the mean square voltage (that is, we effectively have a low-pass filter). If B is the
bandwidth of the RC network,12 then B = 1∕(2πRC) and we can eliminate C in
Equation 1.37 to obtain
v(t) 2 = 2πkTRB

This is the key equation for calculating the mean square noise voltage from a
resistor over a bandwidth B. A more rigorous derivation makes the numerical factor 4
rather than 2π. For a network with a bandwidth B, the rms noise voltage is therefore
vrms = √4kTRB

[1.38]

Equation 1.38 is known as the Johnson resistor noise equation, and it sets the
lower limit of the magnitude of small signals that can be amplified. Note that Equation 1.38 basically tells us the rms value of the voltage fluctuations within a given
bandwidth (B) and not the origin and spectrum (noise voltage vs. frequency) of the
noise. The origin of noise is attributed to the random motions of electrons in the
conductor (resistor), and Equation 1.38 is the fundamental description of electrical
fluctuations; that is, the fluctuations in the conductor’s instantaneous local electron
concentration that charges and discharges the capacitor. To determine the rms noise
voltage across a network with an impedance Z( jω), all we have to do is find the real
part of Z, which represents the resistive part, and use this for R in Equation 1.38.
NOISE IN AN RLC CIRCUIT Most radio receivers have a tuned parallel-resonant circuit,
which consists of an inductor L, capacitor C, and resistance R in parallel. Suppose L is 100 μH;
C is 100 pF; and R, the equivalent resistance due to the input resistance of the amplifier and
to the loss in the coil (coil resistance plus ferrite losses), is about 200 kΩ. What is the minimum
rms radio signal that can be detected?
SOLUTION

Consider the bandwidth of this tuned RLC circuit, which can be found in any electrical engineering textbook:
B=

fo
Q

where fo = 1∕[2π √LC] is the resonant frequency and Q = 2π foCR is the quality factor.
Substituting for L, C, and R, we get, fo = 107∕2π = 1.6 × 106 Hz and Q = 200, which gives
B = 107∕[2π(200)] Hz, or 8 kHz. The rms noise voltage is
vrms = [4kTRB] 1∕2 = [4(1.38 × 10−23 J K−1 ) (300 K) (200 × 103 Ω) (8 × 103 Hz) ] 1∕2

or

This rms voltage is within a bandwidth of 8 kHz centered at 1.6 MHz. This last information is totally absent in Equation 1.38. If we attempt to use

However, Equation 1.37 was derived using the RC circuit in Figure 1.28, whereas we
now have an LCR circuit. The correct approach uses Equation 1.38, which is generally valid,
and the appropriate bandwidth B.

THERMALLY ACTIVATED PROCESSES

1.8.1 ARRHENIUS RATE EQUATION
Many physical and chemical processes strongly depend on temperature and exhibit
what is called an Arrhenius type behavior, in which the rate of change is proportional to exp(−EA∕kT ), where EA is a characteristic energy parameter applicable to
the particular process. For example, when we store food in the refrigerator, we are
effectively using the Arrhenius rate equation: cooling the food diminishes the rate
of decay. Processes that exhibit an Arrhenius type temperature dependence are
referred to as thermally activated.
For an intuitive understanding of a thermally activated process, consider a vertical filing cabinet that stands in equilibrium, with its center of mass at A, as sketched
in Figure 1.29. Tilting the cabinet left or right increases the potential energy PE and
requires external work. If we could supply this energy, we could move the cabinet
over its edge and lay it flat, where its PE would be lower than at A. Clearly, since
the PE at B is lower, this is a more stable position than A. Further, in going from
A to B, we had to overcome a potential energy barrier of amount EA, which corresponds to the cabinet standing on its edge with the center of mass at the highest
point at A*. To topple the cabinet, we must first provide energy13 equal to EA to take
the center of mass to A*, from which point the cabinet, with the slightest encouragement, will fall spontaneously to B to attain the lowest PE. At the end of the whole
tilting process, the internal energy change for the cabinet, ΔU, is due to the change
in the PE (=mgh) from A to B, which is negative; B has lower PE than A.
Suppose, for example, a person with an average energy less than EA tries to
topple the cabinet. Like everyone else, that person experiences energy fluctuations
as a result of interactions with the environment (e.g., what type of day the person
had). During one of those high-energy periods, he can topple the cabinet, even
though most of the time he cannot do so because his average energy is less then EA.
13

According to the conservation of energy principle, the increase in the PE from A to A* must come from the
external work.

1.8

state A to its edge in state A* requires an

Figure 1.30 Diffusion of an
interstitial impurity atom in a
crystal from one void to a
neighboring void.
The impurity atom at position A
must possess an energy EA to push
the host atoms away and move
into the neighboring void at B.

The rate at which the cabinet is toppled depends on the number of times (frequency)
the person tries and the probability that he possesses energy greater than EA.
As an example of a thermally activated process, consider the diffusion of impurity atoms in a solid, one of which is depicted in Figure 1.30. In this example, the
impurity atom is at an interatomic void A in the crystal, called an interstitial site.
For the impurity atom to move from A to a neighboring void B, the atom must push
the host neighbors apart as it moves across. This requires energy in much the same
way as does toppling the filing cabinet. There is a potential energy barrier EA to the
motion of this atom from A to B.
Both the host and the impurity atoms in the solid vibrate about their equilibrium
positions, with a distribution of energies, and they also continually exchange energies,
which leads to energy fluctuations. In thermal equilibrium, at any instant, we can expect
the energy distribution of the atoms to obey the Boltzmann distribution law (see Equation 1.28). The average kinetic energy per atom is vibrational and is 32 kT, which will not
allow the impurity simply to overcome the PE barrier EA, because typically EA ≫ 23 kT.

52

CHAPTER 1

∙

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

The rate of jump, called the diffusion, of the impurity from A to B depends on
two factors. The first is the number of times the atom tries to go over the potential
barrier, which is the vibrational frequency fo, in the AB direction. The second factor
is the probability that the atom has sufficient energy to overcome the PE barrier.
Only during those times when the atom has an energy greater than the potential
energy barrier EA = UA* − UA will it jump across from A to B. During this diffusion
process, the atom attains an activated state, labeled A* in Figure 1.30, with an
energy EA above UA, so the crystal internal energy is higher than UA. EA is called
the activation energy.
Suppose there are N impurity atoms. At any instant, according to the Boltzmann
distribution, nE dE of these will have kinetic energies in the range E to (E + dE),
so the probability that an impurity atom has an energy E greater than EA is

Equation 1.39 describes the rate of a thermally activated process, for which
increasing the temperature causes more atoms to be energetic and hence results in
more jumps over the potential barrier. Equation 1.39 is the well-known Arrhenius
rate equation and is generally valid for a vast number of transformations, both
chemical and physical.

1.8.2 ATOMIC DIFFUSION AND THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT
Consider the motion of the impurity atom in Figure 1.30. For simplicity, assume a
two-dimensional crystal in the plane of the paper, as in Figure 1.31. The impurity
atom has four neighboring voids into which it can jump. If θ is the angle with respect
to the x axis, then these voids are at directions θ = 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, as
depicted in Figure 1.31. Each jump is in a random direction along one of these four
angles. As the impurity atom jumps from void to void, it leaves its original location
at O, and after N jumps, after time t, it has been displaced from O to O′.
Let a be the closest void-to-void separation. Each jump results in a displacement
along x which is equal to a cos θ, with θ = 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. Thus, each jump
14

The integration of nE dE above from EA to infinity tacitly assumes that EA is well above the peak of the
distribution as in Figure 1.23, so that nE is taken to be proportional to exp(−E∕kT). Put differently, it assumes that
EA is greater than the mean thermal energy.

results in a displacement along x which can be a, 0, −a, or 0, corresponding to the
four possibilities. After N jumps, the mean displacement along x will be close to
zero, just as the mean voltage of the ac voltage from a power outlet is zero, even
though it has an rms value of 120 V. We therefore consider the square of the displacements. The total square displacement, denoted X 2, is
X2 = a2 cos2 θ1 + a2 cos2 θ2 + ⋯ + a2 cos2 θN

Clearly, θ = 90° and 270° give cos2 θ = 0. Of all N jumps, 12 N are θ = 0 and
180°, each of which gives cos2 θ = 1. Thus,
X2 =

1 2

2

There will be a similar expression for Y 2, which means that after N jumps, the
total square distance L2 from O to O′ in Figure 1.31 is
L2 = X 2 + Y 2 = a2N

The rate of jumping (frequency of jumps) is given by Equation 1.39
f = fo A exp(−

so the time per jump is 1∕f. Time t for N jumps is N∕f. Thus, N = ft and
L2 = a2ft = 2Dt

where, by definition, D = 12 a2f , which is a constant that depends on the diffusion
process, as well as the temperature, by virtue of f. This constant is generally called
the diffusion coefficient. Substituting for f, we find

where Do is a constant. The root square displacement L in time t, from Equation
1.40, is given by L = [2Dt]1∕2. Since L2 is evaluated from X 2 and Y 2, L is known as
the root mean square (rms) displacement.
The preceding specific example considered the diffusion of an impurity in a void
between atoms in a crystal; this is a simple way to visualize the diffusion process.
An impurity, indeed any atom, at a regular atomic site in the crystal can also diffuse
around by various other mechanisms. For example, such an impurity can simultaneously exchange places with a neighbor. But, more significantly, if a neighboring
atomic site has a vacancy that has been left by a missing host atom, then the impurity can simply jump into this vacancy. (Vacancies in crystals are explained in detail
in Section 1.10.1; for the present, they simply correspond to missing atoms in the
crystal.) The activation energy EA in Equation 1.41 is a measure of the difficulty of
the diffusion process. It may be as simple as the energy (or work) required for an
impurity atom to deform (or strain) the crystal around it as it jumps from one interstitial site to a neighboring interstitial site, as in Figure 1.30; or it may be more
complicated, for example, involving vacancy creation.
Various Si semiconductor devices are fabricated by doping a single Si crystal
with impurities (dopants) at high temperatures. For example, doping the Si crystal
with phosphorus (P) gives the crystal a higher electrical conductivity. The P atoms
substitute directly for Si atoms in the crystal. These dopants migrate from high to
low dopant concentration regions in the crystal by diffusion, which occurs efficiently
only at sufficiently high temperatures.

EXAMPLE 1.15

The diffusion coefficient of P atoms in the Si
crystal follows Equation 1.41 with Do = 10.5 cm2 s−1 and EA = 3.69 eV. What is the diffusion
coefficient at a temperature of 1100 °C at which dopants such as P are diffused into Si to
fabricate various devices? What is the rms distance diffused by P atoms in 5 minutes? Estimate,
as an order of magnitude, how many jumps the P atom makes in 1 second if you take the
jump distance to be roughly the mean interatomic separation, ∼0.27 nm.

Equation 1.40 was derived for a two-dimensional crystal as in Figure 1.31, and for an impurity diffusion. Nonetheless, we can still use it to estimate how many jumps a P atom makes
in 1 second. From Equation 1.40, f ≈ 2D∕a2 ≈ 2(3.0 × 10−17 m2 s−1)∕(0.27 × 10−9 m)2 = 823
jumps per second. It takes roughly 1 ms to make one jump. It is left as an exercise to show
that at room temperature it will take a P atom 1046 years to make a jump! (Scientists and
engineers know how to use thermally activated processes.)

1.9

THE CRYSTALLINE STATE

1.9.1 TYPES OF CRYSTALS
A crystalline solid is a solid in which the atoms bond with each other in a regular
pattern to form a periodic collection (or array) of atoms, as shown for the copper
crystal in Figure 1.32. The most important property of a crystal is periodicity,
which leads to what is termed long-range order. In a crystal, the local bonding
geometry is repeated many times at regular intervals, to produce a periodic array
of atoms that constitutes the crystal structure. The location of each atom is well
known by virtue of periodicity. There is therefore a long-range order, since we can
always predict the atomic arrangement anywhere in the crystal. Nearly all metals,
many ceramics and semiconductors, and various polymers are crystalline solids in
the sense that the atoms or molecules are positioned on a periodic array of points
in space.
All crystals can be described in terms of a lattice and a basis.15 A lattice is an
infinite periodic array of geometric points in space, without any atoms. When we
place an identical group of atoms (or molecules), called a basis, at each lattice
point, we obtain the actual crystal structure. The crystal is thus a lattice plus a
basis at each lattice point. In the copper crystal in Figure 1.32a, each lattice point
has one Cu atom and the basis is a single Cu atom. As apparent from Figure 1.32a,
the lattice of the copper crystal has cubic symmetry and is one of many possible lattices.
Since the crystal is essentially a periodic repetition of a small volume (or cell)
of atoms in three dimensions, it is useful to identify the repeating unit so that the
15

Lattice is a purely imaginary geometric concept whose only requirement is that the infinite array of points has
periodicity. In many informal discussions, the term lattice or crystal lattice is used to mean the crystal structure
itself. These concepts are further developed in Section 1.14 under Additional Topics.

crystal properties can be described through this unit. The unit cell is the most convenient small cell in the crystal structure that carries the properties of the crystal.
The repetition of the unit cell in three dimensions generates the whole crystal structure, as is apparent in Figure 1.32a for the copper crystal.
The unit cell of the copper crystal is cubic with Cu atoms at its corners and one
Cu atom at the center of each face, as indicated in Figure 1.32b. The unit cell of Cu
is thus said to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The Cu atoms are shared
with neighboring unit cells. Effectively, then, only one-eighth of a corner atom is in
the unit cell and one-half of the face-centered atom belongs to the unit cell, as shown
in Figure 1.32b. This means there are effectively four atoms in the unit cell. The
length of the cubic unit cell is termed the lattice parameter a of the crystal structure. For Cu, for example, a is 0.362 nm, whereas the radius R of the Cu atom in
the crystal is 0.128 nm. Assuming the Cu atoms are spheres that touch each other,
we can geometrically relate a and R. For clarity, it is often more convenient to draw
the unit cell with the spheres reduced, as in Figure 1.32c.
The FCC crystal structure of Cu is known as a close-packed crystal structure
because the Cu atoms are packed as closely as possible, as is apparent in Figure 1.32a
and b. The volume of the FCC unit cell is 74 percent full of atoms, which is the
maximum packing possible with identical spheres. By comparison, iron has a bodycentered cubic (BCC) crystal structure, and its unit cell is shown in Figure 1.33.
The BCC unit cell has Fe atoms at its corners and one Fe atom at the center of the
cell. The volume of the BCC unit cell is 68 percent full of atoms, which is lower
than the maximum possible packing.
The FCC crystal structure is only one way to pack the atoms as closely as possible. For example, in zinc, the atoms are arranged as closely as possible in a hexagonal symmetry, to form the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure shown in
Figure 1.34a. This structure corresponds to packing spheres as closely as possible
first as one layer A, as shown in Figure 1.34b. You can visualize this by arranging
six pennies as closely as possible on a table top. On top of layer A we can place an
identical layer B, with the spheres taking up the voids on layer A, as depicted in
Figure 1.34b. The third layer can be placed on top of B and lined up with layer A.
The stacking sequence is therefore ABAB. . . . A unit cell for the HCP structure is
shown in Figure 1.34c, which shows that this is not a cubic structure. The unit cell

shown, although convenient, is not the smallest unit cell. The smallest unit cell for
the HCP structure is shown in Figure 1.34d and is called the hexagonal unit cell.
The repetition of this unit cell will generate the whole HCP structure. The atomic
packing density in the HCP crystal structure is 74 percent, which is the same as that
in the FCC structure.
Covalently bonded solids, such as silicon and germanium, have a diamond crystal structure brought about by the directional nature of the covalent bond, as shown
in Figure 1.35 (see also Figure 1.6). The rigid local bonding geometry of four Si–Si
bonds in the tetrahedral configuration forces the atoms to form what is called the
diamond cubic crystal structure. The unit cell in this case can be identified with
the cubic structure. Although there are atoms at each corner and at the center of
each face, indicating an FCC-like structure, there are four atoms within the cell as
well. Thus, there are eight atoms in the unit cell. The diamond unit cell can actually
be described in terms of an FCC lattice (a geometric arrangement of points) with
each lattice point having a basis of two Si atoms. If we place the two Si atoms at
each site appropriately, for example, one right at the lattice point, and the other
displaced from it by a quarter lattice distance a∕4 along the cube edges, we can
easily generate the diamond unit cell. In the copper crystal, each FCC lattice point
has one Cu atom, whereas in the Si crystal each lattice point has two Si atoms; thus
there are 4 × 2 = 8 atoms in the diamond unit cell.
In the GaAs crystal, as in the silicon crystal, each atom forms four directional
bonds with its neighbors. The unit cell looks like a diamond cubic, as indicated in
Figure 1.36 but with the Ga and As atoms alternating positions. This unit cell is
termed the zinc blende structure after ZnS, which has this type of unit cell. Many
important compound semiconductors have this crystal structure, GaAs being the
most commonly known. The zinc blende unit cell can also be described in terms of
a fundamental FCC lattice and a basis that has two atoms, Zn and S (or Ga and As).
For example, we can place one S at each lattice point and one Zn atom displaced
from the Zn by a∕4 along the cube edges.

In ionic solids, the cations (e.g., Na+) and the anions (Cl−) attract each other
nondirectionally. The crystal structure depends on how closely the opposite ions can
be brought together and how the same ions can best avoid each other while maintaining long-range order, or maintaining symmetry. These depend on the relative charge
and relative size per ion.
To demonstrate the importance of the size effect in two dimensions, consider
identical coins, say pennies (1-cent coins). At most, we can make six pennies
touch one penny, as shown in Figure 1.37. On the other hand, if we use quarters16

Although many are familiar with the United States coinage, any two coins with a size ratio of about 0.75 would
work out the same.

(25-cent coins) to touch one penny, at most only five quarters can do so. However,
this arrangement cannot be extended to the construction of a two-dimensional
crystal with periodicity. To fulfill the long-range symmetry requirement for crystals, we can only use four quarters to touch the penny and thereby build a twodimensional “penny–quarter” crystal, which is shown in the figure. In the
two-dimensional crystal, a penny has four quarters as nearest neighbors; similarly,
a quarter has four pennies as nearest neighbors. A convenient unit cell is a square
cell with one-quarter of a penny at each corner and a full penny at the center (as
shown in the figure).
The three-dimensional equivalent of the unit cell of the penny–quarter crystal is
the NaCl unit cell shown in Figure 1.38. The Na+ ion is about half the size of the
Cl− ion, which permits six nearest neighbors while maintaining long-range order.
The repetition of this unit cell in three dimensions generates the whole NaCl crystal,
which was depicted in Figure 1.9b.
A similar unit cell with Na+ and Cl− interchanged is also possible and equally
convenient. We can therefore describe the whole crystal with two interpenetrating
FCC unit cells, each having oppositely charged ions at the corners and face centers.
Many ionic solids have the rock salt (NaCl) crystal structure.
When the cation and anions have equal charges and are about the same size,
as in the CsCl crystal, the unit cell is called the CsCl unit cell, which is shown
in Figure 1.39. Each cation is surrounded by eight anions (and vice versa),
which are at the corners of a cube. This is not a true BCC unit cell because the
atoms at various BCC lattice points are different. (As discussed in Section 1.14,
CsCl has a simple cubic lattice with a basis that has one Cl− ion and one
Cs+ ion.)
Table 1.3 summarizes some of the important properties of the main crystal
structures considered in this section.

Calculate the atomic concentration (number of atoms per unit volume) in Cu and the

of the Cu atom is 0.128 nm.

SOLUTION

a.

b.

There are four atoms per unit cell. The Cu atom at each corner is shared with eight other
adjoining unit cells. Each Cu atom at the face center is shared with the neighboring unit
cell. Thus, the number of atoms in the unit cell = 8 corners ( 18 atom) + 6 faces ( 12 atom) =
4 atoms.
Consider the unit cell shown in Figure 1.40 and one of the cubic faces. The face is a
square of side a and the diagonal is √a2 + a2 or a √2. The diagonal has one atom at
the center of diameter 2R, which touches two atoms centered at the corners. The diagonal, going from corner to corner, is therefore R + 2R + R. Thus, 4R = a √2 and
a = 4R∕√2 = R2 √2. Therefore, a = 0.3620 nm.

1.9.2 CRYSTAL DIRECTIONS AND PLANES
There can be a number of possibilities for choosing a unit cell for a given crystal
structure, as is apparent in Figure 1.34c and d for the HCP crystal. As a convention,
we generally represent the geometry of the unit cell as a parallelepiped with sides
a, b, and c and angles α, β, and γ, as depicted in Figure 1.41a. The sides a, b, and c
and angles α, β, and γ are referred to as the lattice parameters. To establish a reference frame and to apply three-dimensional geometry, we insert an xyz coordinate
system. The x, y, and z axes follow the edges of the parallelepiped and the origin is

at the lower-left rear corner of the cell. The unit cell extends along the x axis from
0 to a, along y from 0 to b, and along z from 0 to c.
For Cu and Fe, the unit-cell geometry has a = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°, and cubic
symmetry. For Zn, the unit cell has hexagonal geometry, with a = b ≠ c, α = β = 90°,
and γ = 120°, as shown in Figure 1.34d.
In explaining crystal properties, we must frequently specify a direction in a
crystal, or a particular plane of atoms. Many properties, for example, the elastic
modulus, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, etc., are directional within the
crystal. We use the convention described here for labeling crystal directions based
on three-dimensional geometry.
All parallel vectors have the same indices. Therefore, the direction to be labeled
can be moved to pass through the origin of the unit cell. As an example, Figure 1.41b

1.9

THE CRYSTALLINE STATE

shows a direction whose indices are to be determined. A point P on the vector can
be expressed by the coordinates xo, yo, zo where xo, yo, and zo are projections from
point P onto the x, y, and z axes, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.41b. It is generally convenient to place P where the line cuts a surface (though this is not necessary).
We can express these coordinates in terms of the lattice parameters a, b, and c,
respectively. We then have three coordinates, say x1, y1, and z1, for point P in terms
of a, b, and c. For example, if
xo, yo, zo

are

1
1
a, b, c
2
2

x1, y1, z1

i.e.,

1
1
, 1,
2
2

then P is at

We then multiply or divide these numbers until we have the smallest integers
(which may include 0). If we call these integers u, v, and w, then the direction is written in square brackets without commas as [uvw]. If any integer is a negative number,
we use a bar on top of that integer. For the particular direction in Figure 1.41b, we
therefore have [121].
Some of the important directions in a cubic lattice are shown in Figure 1.41c.
For example, the x, y, and z directions in the cube are [100], [010], and [001], as
shown. Reversing a direction simply changes the sign of each index. The negative
x, y, and z directions are [100], [010], and [001], respectively.
Certain directions in the crystal are equivalent because the differences between them
are based only on our arbitrary decision for labeling x, y, and z directions. For example,
[100] and [010] are different simply because of the way in which we labeled the x and
y axes. Indeed, directional properties of a material (e.g., elastic modulus, and dielectric
susceptibility) along the edge of the cube [100] are invariably the same as along the
other edges, for example, [010] and [001]. All of these directions along the edges of
the cube constitute a family of directions, which is any set of directions considered to
be equivalent. We label a family of directions, for example, [100], [010], [001], . . . ,
by using a common notation, triangular brackets. Thus, ⟨100⟩ represents the family of
six directions, [100], [010], [001], [100], [010], and [001] in a cubic crystal. Similarly,
the family of diagonal directions in the cube, shown in Figure 1.41c, is denoted ⟨111⟩.
We also frequently need to describe a particular plane in a crystal. Figure 1.42
shows a general unit cell with a plane to be labeled. We use the following convention, called the Miller indices of a plane, for this purpose.
We take the intercepts xo, yo, and zo of the plane on the x, y, and z axes, respectively. If the plane passes through the origin, we can use another convenient parallel
plane, or simply shift the origin to another point. All planes that have been shifted
by a lattice parameter have identical Miller indices.
We express the intercepts xo, yo, and zo in terms of the lattice parameters a, b,
and c, respectively, to obtain x1, y1, and z1. We then invert these numbers. Taking
the reciprocals, we obtain

We then clear all fractions, without reducing to lowest integers, to obtain a set
of integers, say h, k, and ℓ. We then put these integers into parentheses, without
commas, that is, (hkℓ). For the plane in Figure 1.42a, we have
Intercepts xo, yo, and zo are 12 a, 1b, and ∞c.
Intercepts x1, y1, and z1, in terms of a, b, and c, are 12 , 1, and ∞.
Reciprocals 1∕x1, 1∕y1, and 1∕z1 are 1∕ 12 , 1∕1, 1∕∞ = 2, 1, 0.
This set of numbers does not have fractions, so it is not necessary to clear fractions. Hence, the Miller indices (hkℓ) are (210).
If there is a negative integer due to a negative intercept, a bar is placed across
the top of the integer. Also, if parallel planes differ only by a shift that involves a
multiple number of lattice parameters, then these planes may be assigned the same
Miller indices. For example, the plane (010) is the xz plane that cuts the y axis at −b.

1.9

THE CRYSTALLINE STATE

65

If we shift the plane along y by two lattice parameters (2b), it will cut the y axis at
b and the Miller indices will become (010). In terms of the unit cell, the (010) plane
is the same as the (010) plane, as shown in Figure 1.42b. Note that not all parallel
planes are identical. Planes can have the same Miller indices only if they are separated by a multiple of the lattice parameter. For example, the (010) plane is not
identical to the (020) plane, even though they are geometrically parallel. In terms of
the unit cell, plane (010) is a face of the unit cell cutting the y axis at b, whereas
(020) is a plane that is halfway inside the unit cell, cutting the y axis at 12 b. The
planes contain different numbers of atoms. The (020) plane cannot be shifted by the
lattice parameter b to coincide with plane (010).
It is apparent from Figure 1.42b that in the case of the cubic crystal, the [hkℓ]
direction is always perpendicular to the (hkℓ) plane.
Certain planes in the crystal belong to a family of planes because their indices
differ only as a consequence of the arbitrary choice of axis labels. For example, the
indices of the (100) plane become (010) if we switch the x and y axes. All the (100),
(010), and (001) planes, and hence the parallel (100), (010), (001) planes, form a
family of planes, conveniently denoted by curly brackets as {100}.
Frequently we need to know the number of atoms per unit area on a given plane
(hkℓ). For example, if the surface concentration of atoms is high on one plane, then
that plane may encourage oxide growth more rapidly than another plane where there
are less atoms per unit area. Planar concentration of atoms is the number of atoms
per unit area, that is, the surface concentration of atoms, on a given plane in the
crystal. Among the {100}, {110}, and {111} planes in FCC crystals, the most
densely packed planes, those with the highest planar concentration, are {111} planes
and the least densely packed are {110}.
MILLER INDICES AND PLANAR CONCENTRATION Consider the plane shown in Figure 1.43a,

which passes through one side of a face and the center of an opposite face in the FCC lattice.
The plane passes through the origin at the lower-left rear corner. We therefore shift the origin
to say point O′ at the lower-right rear corner of the unit cell. In terms of a, the plane cuts
the x, y, and z axes at ∞, −1, 12 , respectively. We take the reciprocals to obtain, 0, −1, 2.
Therefore, the Miller indices are (012).
To calculate the planar concentration n(hkℓ) on a given (hkℓ) plane, we consider a bound
area A of the (hkℓ) plane within the unit cell as in Figure 1.43b. Only atoms whose centers lie
on A are involved in n(hkℓ). For each atom, we then evaluate what portion of the atomic cross
section (a circle in two dimensions) cut by the plane (hkℓ) is contained within A. Consider
the Cu FCC crystal with a = 0.3620 nm.
The (100) plane corresponds to a cube face and has an area A = a2. There is one full
atom at the center; that is, the (100) plane cuts through one full atom, one full circle in two
dimensions, at the face center as in Figure 1.43b. However, not all corner atoms are within
A. Only a quarter of a circle is within the bound area A in Figure 1.43b.
Number of atoms in A = (4 corners) × ( 41 atom) + 1 atom at face center = 2

Similarly, for the (111) plane, n(111) is 17.0 atoms nm−2. Clearly the (111) planes are the
most and (110) planes are the least densely packed among the (100), (110), and (111) planes.
We can estimate the surface concentration nsurf of atoms from the bulk concentration
nbulk. The quantity 1∕n1∕3
bulk represents the separation of the atoms d. Taking each atom to be
a cube then d is the side of this cube. An atom on the surface occupies an area d 2 and there28

copper from Example 1.16, nsurf ≈ nbulk = (8.43 × 10 m ) = 1.92 × 10 m which is

and not too far out from n(111). (Question 1.4 explores this further.)

1.9.3 ALLOTROPY AND CARBON
Certain substances can have more than one crystal structure, iron being one of
the best-known examples. This characteristic is termed polymorphism or allotropy.
Below 912 °C, iron has the BCC structure and is called α-Fe. Between 912 °C and
1400 °C, iron has the FCC structure and is called γ-Fe. Above 1400 °C, iron again
has the BCC structure and is called δ-Fe. Since iron has more than one crystal
structure, it is called polymorphic. Each iron crystal structure is an allotrope or
a polymorph.
The allotropes of iron are all metals. Furthermore, one allotrope changes to
another at a well-defined temperature called a transition temperature, which in this
case is 912 °C.

Many substances have allotropes that exhibit widely different properties. Moreover, for some polymorphic substances, the transformation from one allotrope to
another cannot be achieved by a change of temperature, but requires the application
of pressure, as in the transformation of graphite to diamond.
Carbon has three important crystalline allotropes: diamond, graphite, and the
recently discovered buckminsterfullerene. These crystal structures are shown in
Figure 1.44a, b, and c, respectively, and their properties are summarized in Table 1.4.
Graphite is the carbon form that is stable at room temperature. Diamond is the
stable form at very high pressures. Once formed, diamond continues to exist at
atmospheric pressures and below about 900 °C, because the transformation rate of
diamond to graphite is virtually zero under these conditions. Graphite and diamond
have widely differing properties, which lead to diverse applications. For example,
graphite is an electrical conductor, whereas diamond is an insulator. Diamond is the
hardest substance known. On the other hand, the carbon layers in graphite can readily slide over each other under shear stresses, because the layers are only held together

by weak secondary bonds (van der Waals bonds). This is the reason for graphite’s
lubricating properties.
Buckminsterfullerene is another polymorph of carbon. In the buckminsterfullerene
molecule (called the “buckyball”), 60 carbon atoms bond with each other to form a
perfect soccer ball–type molecule. The C60 molecule has 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons joined together to form a spherical molecule, with each C atom at a corner, as
depicted in Figure 1.44c. The molecules are produced in the laboratory by a carbon
arc in a partial atmosphere of an inert gas (He); they are also found in the soot of
partial combustion. The crystal form of buckminsterfullerene has the FCC structure,
with each C60 molecule occupying a lattice point and being held together by van der
Waals forces, as shown in Figure 1.44c. The Buckminsterfullerene crystal is a semiconductor, and its compounds with alkali metals, such as K3C60, exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures (below 18 K). Mechanically, it is a soft material.
Diamond, graphite, and the fullerene crystals are not the only crystalline allotropes of carbon, and neither are they the only structural forms of carbon. For example, lonsdaleite, which is another crystalline allotrope, is hexagonal diamond in
which each C atom covalently bonds to four neighbors, as in diamond, but the
crystal structure has hexagonal symmetry. (It forms from graphite on meteors when

1 .1 0

CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE

the meteors impact the Earth; currently it is only found in Arizona.) Amorphous
carbon has no crystal structure (no long-range order), so it is not a crystalline allotrope, but many scientists define it as a form or phase of carbon, or as a structural
“allotrope.” The recently discovered carbon nanotubes are thin and long carbon
tubes, perhaps 10 to 100 microns long but only several nanometers in diameter, hence
the name nanotube. They are tubes made from rolling a graphite sheet into a tube
and then capping the ends with hemispherical buckyballs. The carbon tube is really
a single macromolecule rather than a crystal in its traditional sense17; it is a structural
form of carbon. Carbon nanotubes have many interesting and remarkable properties
and offer much potential for various applications in electronics; the most topical currently being carbon nanotube field emission devices. (See, for example, Figure 4.47d.)

1.10

CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS AND THEIR
SIGNIFICANCE

By bringing all the atoms together to try to form a perfect crystal, we lower the total
potential energy of the atoms as much as possible for that particular structure. What
happens when the crystal is grown from a liquid or vapor; do you always get a
perfect crystal? What happens when the temperature is raised? What happens when
impurities are added to the solid?
There is no such thing as a perfect crystal. We must therefore understand the
types of defects that can exist in a given crystal structure. Quite often, key mechanical and electrical properties are controlled by these defects.

1.10.1

POINT DEFECTS: VACANCIES AND IMPURITIES

Above the absolute zero temperature, all crystals have atomic vacancies or atoms
missing from lattice sites in the crystal structure. The vacancies exist as a requirement of thermal equilibrium and are called thermodynamic defects. Vacancies
introduce disorder into the crystal by upsetting the perfect periodicity of atomic
arrangements.
We know from the kinetic molecular theory that all the atoms in a crystal vibrate
about their equilibrium positions with a distribution of energies, a distribution that
closely resembles the Boltzmann distribution. At some instant, there may be one atom
with sufficient energy to break its bonds and jump to an adjoining site on the surface,
as depicted in Figure 1.45. This leaves a vacancy behind, just below the surface.
This vacancy can then diffuse into the bulk of the crystal, because a neighboring
atom can diffuse into it.
This latter process of vacancy creation has been shown to be a sequence of
events in Figure 1.45. Suppose that Ev is the average energy required to create such

[1.42]

At all temperatures above absolute zero, there will always be an equilibrium
concentration of vacancies, as dictated by Equation 1.42. Although we considered
only one possible vacancy creation process in Figure 1.45, there are other processes
that also create vacancies. Furthermore, we have shown the vacancy to be the same
size in the lattice as the missing atom, which is not entirely true. The neighboring
atoms around a vacancy close in to take up some of the slack, as shown in Figure 1.46a. This means that the crystal lattice around the vacancy is distorted from
the perfect arrangement over a few atomic dimensions. The vacancy volume is therefore smaller than the volume of the missing atom.
Vacancies are only one type of point defect in a crystal structure. Point defects
generally involve lattice changes or distortions of a few atomic distances, as depicted
in Figure 1.46a. The crystal structure may contain impurities, either naturally or as
a consequence of intentional addition, as in the case of silicon crystals grown for
microelectronics. If the impurity atom substitutes directly for the host atom, the result
is called a substitutional impurity and the resulting crystal structure is that of a
substitutional solid solution, as shown in Figure 1.46b and c. When a Si crystal is
“doped” with small amounts of arsenic (As) atoms, the As atoms substitute directly
for the Si atoms in the Si crystal; that is, the arsenic atoms are substitutional impurities.
The impurity atom can also place itself in an interstitial site, that is, in a void between

The proper derivation of the vacancy concentration involves considering thermodynamics and equilibrium
concepts. In the actual thermodynamic expression, the pre-exponential term in Equation 1.42 is not unity but a
factor that depends on the change in the entropy of the crystal upon vacancy creation. For nearly all practical
purposes, Equation 1.42 is sufficient.

the host atoms, as carbon does in the BCC iron crystal. In that case, the impurity is
called an interstitial impurity, as shown in Figure 1.46d.
In general, the impurity atom will have both a different valency and a different
size. It will therefore distort the lattice around it. For example, if a substitutional
impurity atom is larger than the host atom, the neighboring host atoms will be pushed
away, as in Figure 1.46b. The crystal region around an impurity is therefore distorted
from the perfect periodicity and the lattice is said to be strained around a point
defect. A smaller substitutional impurity atom will pull in the neighboring atoms,
as in Figure 1.46c. Typically, interstitial impurities tend to be small atoms compared to
the host atoms, a typical example being the small carbon atom in the BCC iron crystal.
In an ionic crystal, such as NaCl, which consists of anions (Cl−) and cations
+
(Na ), one common type of defect is called a Schottky defect. This involves a missing cation–anion pair (which may have migrated to the surface), so the neutrality is
maintained, as indicated in Figure 1.47a. These Schottky defects are responsible for

71

CHAPTER 1

the major optical and electrical properties of alkali halide crystals. Another type of
defect in the ionic crystal is the Frenkel defect, which occurs when a host ion is
displaced into an interstitial position, leaving a vacancy at its original site. The
interstitial ion and the vacancy pair constitute the Frenkel defect, as identified in
Figure 1.47a. For the AgCl crystal, which has predominantly Frenkel defects, an Ag+
is in an interstitial position. The concentration of such Frenkel defects is given by
Equation 1.42, with an appropriate defect creation energy Edefect instead of Ev.
Ionic crystals can also have substitutional and interstitial impurities that become
ionized in the lattice. Overall, the ionic crystal must be neutral. Suppose that an
Mg2+ ion substitutes for an Na+ ion in the NaCl crystal, as depicted in Figure 1.47b.
Since the overall crystal must be neutral, either one Na+ ion is missing somewhere
in the crystal, or an additional Cl− ion exists in the crystal. Similarly, when a doubly
charged negative ion, such as O2−, substitutes for Cl−, there must either be an additional cation (usually in an interstitial site) or a missing Cl− somewhere in order to
maintain charge neutrality in the crystal. The most likely type of defect depends on
the composition of the ionic solid and the relative sizes and charges of the ions.

EXAMPLE 1.18

VACANCY CONCENTRATION IN A METAL The energy of formation of a vacancy in the

aluminum crystal is about 0.70 eV. Calculate the fractional concentration of vacancies in Al at
room temperature, 300 K, and very close to its melting temperature 660 °C. What is the vacancy
concentration at 660 °C given that the atomic concentration in Al is about 6.0 × 1022 cm−3?

SOLUTION

Using Equation 1.42, the fractional concentration of vacancies are as follows:
At 300 K,

= exp(− ) = exp[ −

= exp(− ) = exp[ −
N
kT
(1.38 × 10−23 J K−1 ) (933 K) ]
= 1.7 × 10−4

That is, almost 1 in 6000 atomic sites is a vacancy. The atomic concentration N in Al is about
6.0 × 1022 cm−3, which means that the vacancy concentration nv at 660 °C is
nv = (6.0 × 1022 cm−3)(1.7 × 10−4) = 1.0 × 1019 cm−3

The mean vacancy separation (on the order of nv−1∕3) at 660 °C is therefore roughly 5 nm.
The mean atomic separation in Al is ∼0.3 nm (∼N −1∕3), so the mean separation between
vacancies is only about 20 atomic separations! (A more accurate version of Equation 1.42,
with an entropy term, shows that the vacancy concentration is even higher than the estimate
in this example.) The increase in the linear thermal expansion coefficient of a metal with
temperature near its melting temperature, as shown for Mo in Figure 1.20, has been attributed
to the generation of vacancies in the crystal.

the atomic mass Mat and density ρ of Ge are 72.64 g mol−1 and 5.32 g cm−3, respectively?
Neglect the change in the density with temperature which is small compared with other
approximations in Equation 1.42.

which is orders of magnitude less than that for Al at its melting temperature in Example 1.18;
vacancies in covalent crystals cost much more energy than those in metals.
The number of Ge atoms per unit volume is

so that at 938 °C,
nv = (4.4 × 1022 cm−3)(7.0 × 10−10) = 3.1 × 1013 cm−3

Only 1 in 109 atoms is a vacancy. A better calculation would also consider the decrease in
the atomic concentration N with temperature (due to the expansion of the crystal). The final
nv is still about 3 × 1013 cm−3.

1.10.2 LINE DEFECTS: EDGE AND SCREW DISLOCATIONS
A line defect is formed in a crystal when an atomic plane terminates within the
crystal instead of passing all the way to the end of the crystal, as depicted in Figure 1.48a. The edge of this short plane of atoms is therefore like a line running inside
the crystal. The planes neighboring (i.e., above) this short plane are dislocated (displaced) with respect to those below the line. We therefore call this type of defect an
edge dislocation and use an inverted ⊤ symbol. The vertical line corresponds to
the half-plane of atoms in the crystal, as illustrated in Figure 1.48a. It is clear that the
atoms around the dislocation line have been effectively displaced from their perfectcrystal equilibrium positions, which results in atoms being out of registry above and
below the dislocation. The atoms above the dislocation line are pushed together,
whereas those below it are pulled apart, so there are regions of compression and
tension above and below the dislocation line, respectively, as depicted by the shaded
region around the dislocation line in Figure 1.48b. Therefore, around a dislocation
line, we have a strain field due to the stretching or compressing of bonds.
The energy required to create a dislocation is typically on the order of 100 eV
per nm of dislocation line. On the other hand, it takes only a few eV to form a point
defect, which is a few nanometers in dimension. In other words, forming a number
of point defects is energetically more favorable than forming a dislocation. Dislocations are not equilibrium defects. They normally arise when the crystal is deformed
by stress, or when the crystal is actually being grown.

side of a line (AB).

Another type of dislocation is the screw dislocation, which is essentially a
shearing of one portion of the crystal with respect to another, by one atomic distance, as illustrated in Figure 1.49a. The displacement occurs on either side of the
screw dislocation line. The circular arrow around the line symbolizes the screw
dislocation. As we move away from the dislocation line, the atoms in the upper
portion become more out of registry with those below; at the edge of the crystal,
this displacement is one atomic distance, as illustrated in Figure 1.49b. Line defects
are easily observable by examining a thin slice of the material under a transmission
electron microscope (TEM). They often appear as dark lines as apparent in the TEM
photos on page 76.

Both edge and screw dislocations are generally created by stresses resulting from
thermal and mechanical processing. A line defect is not necessarily either a pure
edge or a pure screw dislocation; it can be a mixture, as depicted in Figure 1.50.
Screw dislocations frequently occur during crystal growth, which involves atomic
stacking on the surface of a crystal. Such dislocations aid crystallization by providing an additional “edge” to which the incoming atoms can attach, as illustrated in
Figure 1.51. If an atom arrives at the surface of a perfect crystal, it can only attach
to one atom in the plane below. However, if there is a screw dislocation, the incoming atom can attach to an edge and thereby form more bonds; hence, it can lower
its potential energy more than anywhere else on the surface. With incoming atoms
attaching to the edges, the growth occurs spirally around the screw dislocation, and
the final crystal surface reflects this spiral growth geometry.
The phenomenon of plastic or permanent deformation of a metal depends
totally on the presence and motions of dislocations, as discussed in elementary books
on the mechanical properties of materials. In the case of electrical properties of
metals, we will see in Chapter 2 that dislocations increase the resistivity of materials, cause significant leakage current in a pn junction, and give rise to unwanted
electronic noise in various semiconductor devices. Fortunately, the occurrence of
dislocations in semiconductor crystals can be controlled and nearly eliminated. In a
metal interconnection line on a chip, there may be an average of 104−105 dislocation
lines per mm2 of crystal, whereas a silicon crystal wafer that is carefully grown may
typically have only 1 dislocation line per mm2 of crystal.
Modern electronic and optoelectronic devices are fabricated commonly by epitaxy,
in which a new crystalline layer of a semiconductor is grown on top of another
semiconductor crystal, called the substrate. The new layer that is grown is called
the epitaxial layer or epilayer. In heteroepitaxy, the new layer is a different semiconductor than the substrate. For example, in one technique (molecular beam epitaxy), the new layer is grown on a substrate crystal essentially by the deposition of

the new epitaxial layer. If the lattice constants ae and as for epitaxial and the substrate
crystals respectively are the same (ae = as), the growth is lattice matched and “free”
of defects at the interface as shown in Figure 1.52a. In practice, there is some mismatch in ae and as, usually due to a limited choice of substrate crystals available for
the epitaxial semiconductor. Consider an epitaxial layer in which ae > as; the case

known as buffer layers.

structure as the substrate but that means the epilayer is compressed in the plane of
growth and under tensile strain in the perpendicular direction. At some critical thickness, it becomes energetically more favorable to create dislocations and have the
epilayer follow its own crystal structure as in Figure 1.52b. These interface dislocations are called misfit dislocations and appear in the plane of growth as shown in
Figure 1.52b and c. It may be thought that, as in Figure 1.52b, these are the only
dislocations formed during a mismatched epilayer growth but there are also dislocations that penetrate the epilayer from the interface as shown in Figure 1.52c, similar
to the way in which an edge dislocation and a screw dislocation may be parts of the
same line defect as in Figure 1.50. These are called threading dislocations, and they
come out of the plane of growth and penetrate the epilayer.19 Electronic devices are
formed within the epilayer and we need to eliminate the appearance of dislocations
in this layer. This is quite often done by having an intermediate buffer layer between
the substrate and the actual epilayer or having the devices fabricated in the epilayer
away from the interface.

1.10.3 PLANAR DEFECTS: GRAIN BOUNDARIES
Many materials are polycrystalline; that is, they are composed of many small crystals
oriented in different directions. In fact, the growth of a flawless single crystal from
what is called the melt (liquid) requires special skills, in addition to scientific knowledge. When a liquid is cooled to below its freezing temperature, solidification does
not occur at every point in the liquid; rather, it occurs at certain sites called nuclei,
which are small crystal-like structures containing perhaps 50 to 100 atoms. Figure
1.53a to c depicts a typical solidification process from the melt. The liquid atoms
adjacent to a nucleus diffuse into the nucleus, thereby causing it to grow in size to
become a small crystal, or a crystallite, called a grain. Since the nuclei are randomly
oriented when they are formed, the grains have random crystallographic orientations
19
The science of dislocations appearing during epitaxial growth is quite complicated but this simple example
illustrates how easily they can form in a mismatched epitaxial crystal growth. Lattice matching the epilayer and
the substrate is obviously an important field of research in today’s modern optoelectronic devices.

during crystallite growth. As the liquid between the grains is consumed, some grains
meet and obstruct each other. At the end of solidification, therefore, the whole structure has grains with irregular shapes and orientations, as shown in Figure 1.53c.
It is apparent from Figure 1.53c that in contrast to a single crystal, a polycrystalline material has grain boundaries where differently oriented crystals meet. As indicated in Figure 1.54, the atoms at the grain boundaries obviously cannot follow their
natural bonding habits, because the crystal orientation suddenly changes across the
boundary. Therefore, there are both voids at the grain boundary and stretched and
broken bonds. In addition, in this region, there are misplaced atoms that do not follow
the crystalline pattern on either side of the boundary. Consequently, the grain boundary
represents a high-energy region per atom with respect to the energy per atom within
the bulk of the grains themselves. The atoms can diffuse more easily along a grain
boundary because (a) less bonds need to be broken due to the presence of voids and
(b) the bonds are strained and easily broken anyway. In many polycrystalline materials,
impurities therefore tend to congregate in the grain boundary region. We generally
refer to the atomic arrangement in the grain boundary region as being disordered
due to the presence of the voids and misplaced atoms.

Since the energy of an atom at the grain boundary is greater than that of an atom
within the grain, these grain boundaries are nonequilibrium defects; consequently,
they try to reduce in size to give the whole structure a lower potential energy. At or
around room temperature, the atomic diffusion process is slow; thus, the reduction in
the grain boundary is insignificant. At elevated temperatures, however, atomic diffusion allows big grains to grow, at the expense of small grains, which leads to grain
coarsening (grain growth) and hence to a reduction in the grain boundary area.
Mechanical engineers have learned to control the grain size, and hence the
mechanical properties of metals to suit their needs, through various thermal treatment
cycles. For electrical engineers, the grain boundaries become important when designing electronic devices based on polysilicon or any polycrystalline semiconductor. For
example, in highly polycrystalline materials, particularly thin-film semiconductors
(e.g., polysilicon), the resistivity is invariably determined by polycrystallinity, or
grain size, of the material, as discussed in Section 2.10.2.

1.10.4 CRYSTAL SURFACES AND SURFACE PROPERTIES
In describing crystal structures, we assume that the periodicity extends to infinity
which means that the regular array of atoms is not interrupted anywhere by the
presence of real surfaces of the material. In practice, we know that all substances
have real surfaces. When the crystal lattice is abruptly terminated by a surface, the
atoms at the surface cannot fulfill their bonding requirements as illustrated in Figure 1.55. For simplicity, the figure shows a Si crystal schematically sketched in two
dimensions where each atom in the bulk of the crystal has four covalent bonds, each
covalent bond having two electrons.20 The atoms at the surface are left with dangling
bonds, bonds that are half full, only having one electron. These dangling bonds are
looking for atoms to which they can bond. Two neighboring surface atoms can share
20

Not all possibilities shown in Figure 1.55 occur in practice; their occurrences depend on the preparation
method of the crystal.

each other’s dangling bond electrons, that is, form a surface bond with each other.
This bonding between surface atoms causes a slight displacement of the surface
atoms and leads to a surface that has been reconstructed.
Atoms from the environment can also bond with the atoms on the crystal surface.
For example, a hydrogen atom can be captured by a dangling bond at the surface to
form a chemical bond as a result of which hydrogen becomes absorbed. Primary
bonding of foreign atoms to a crystal surface is called chemisorption. The H atom in
Figure 1.55 forms a covalent bond with a Si atom and hence becomes chemisorbed.
However, the H2O molecule cannot form a covalent bond, but, because of hydrogen
bonding, it can form a secondary bond with a surface Si atom and become adsorbed.
Secondary bonding of foreign atoms or molecules to a crystal surface is called
physisorption (physical adsorption). Water molecules in the air can readily become
adsorbed at the surface of a crystal. Although the figure also shows a physisorbed
H2 molecule as an example, this normally occurs at very low temperatures where
crystal vibrations are too weak to quickly dislodge the H2 molecule. It should be
remarked that in many cases, atoms or molecules from the environment become
adsorbed at the surface for only a certain period of time; they have a certain sticking
or dwell time. For example, at room temperature, inert gases stick to a metal surface
only for a duration of the order of microseconds, which is extremely long compared
with the vibrational period of the crystal atoms (~10−12 seconds). A dangling bond
can capture a free electron from the environment if one is available in its vicinity.
The same idea applies to a dangling bond at a grain boundary as in Figure 1.54.
At sufficiently high temperatures, some of the absorbed foreign surface atoms
can diffuse into the crystal volume to become bulk impurities. Many substances have
a natural oxide layer on the surface that starts with the chemical bonding of oxygen
atoms to the surface atoms and the subsequent growth of the oxide layer. For example,
aluminum surfaces always have a thin aluminum oxide layer. In addition, the surface
of the oxide often has adsorbed organic species of atoms usually from machining

and handling. The surface condition of a Si crystal wafer in microelectronics is
normally controlled by first etching the surface and then oxidizing it at a high temperature to form a SiO2 passivating layer on the crystal surface. This oxide layer is
an excellent barrier against the diffusion of impurity atoms into the crystal. (It is
also an excellent electrical insulator.)
Figure 1.55 shows only some of the possibilities at the surface of a crystal. Generally the surface structure depends greatly on the mode of surface formation, which
invariably involves thermal and mechanical processing, and previous environmental
history. One visualization of a crystal surface is based on the terrace-ledge-kink
model, the so-called Kossel model, as illustrated in Figure 1.56a and b. The surface

has ledges, kinks, and various imperfections such as holes and dislocations, as well as
impurities which can diffuse to and from the surface. The dimensions of the various
imperfections (e.g., the step size) depend on the process that generated the surface.

1.10.5 STOICHIOMETRY, NONSTOICHIOMETRY, AND DEFECT STRUCTURES
Stoichiometric compounds are those that have an integer ratio of atoms, for example, as in CaF2 where two F atoms bond with one Ca atom. Similarly, in the compound ZnO, if there is one O atom for every Zn atom, the compound is
stoichiometric, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1.57a. Since there are equal
numbers of O2− anions and Zn2+ cations, the crystal overall is neutral. It is also
possible to have a nonstoichiometric ZnO in which there is excess zinc. This may
result if, for example, there is insufficient oxygen during the preparation of the
compound. The Zn2+ ion has a radius of 0.074 nm, which is about 1.9 times smaller
than the O2− anion (radius of 0.14 nm), so it is much easier for a Zn2+ ion to enter
an interstitial site than the O2− ion or the Zn atom itself, which has a radius of 0.133
nm. Excess Zn atoms therefore occupy interstitial sites as Zn2+ cations. Even though
the excess zinc atoms are still ionized within the crystal, their lost electrons cannot
be taken by oxygen atoms, which are all O2− anions, as indicated in Figure 1.57b.
Thus, the nonstoichiometric ZnO with excess Zn has Zn2+ cations in interstitial sites
and mobile electrons within the crystal, which can contribute to the conduction of
electricity. Overall, the crystal is neutral, as the number of Zn2+ ions is equal to the
number of O2− ions plus two electrons from each excess Zn. The structure shown in
Figure 1.57b is a defect structure, since it deviates from the stoichiometry.

SINGLE-CRYSTAL CZOCHRALSKI GROWTH

The fabrication of discrete and integrated circuit (IC) solid-state devices requires
semiconductor crystals with impurity concentrations as low as possible and crystals
that contain very few imperfections. A number of laboratory techniques are available
for growing high-purity semiconductor crystals. Generally, they involve either solidification from the melt or condensation of atoms from the vapor phase. The initial

process in IC fabrication requires large single-crystal wafers that are typically 15–30 cm
in diameter and 0.6 mm thick. These wafers are cut from a long, cylindrical single
Si crystal (typically, 1–2 m in length).
Large, single Si crystals for IC fabrication are often grown by the Czochralski
method, which involves growing a single-crystal ingot from the melt, using solidification on a seed crystal, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1.58a. Molten Si is
held in a quartz (crystalline SiO2) crucible in a graphite susceptor, which is either
heated by a graphite resistance heater or by a radio frequency induction coil (a process
called RF heating).21 A small dislocation-free crystal, called a seed, is lowered to

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

Jan Czochralski (1885–1953) was a Polish chemist who discovered the crystal
growth technique that is named after him in 1916. He apparently, by accident,
dipped his pen into molten tin instead of the ink pot. When he pulled it out, he
discovered solidified tin hanging from the nib. Further experiments lead to the
development of this crystal growth technique, which was published in 1918 in
a well-known German chemistry journal Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.
In the 1950s, the US researchers Gordon Teal and J.B. Little at Bell Labs (see
page 123) started to use the technique to grow Ge single crystals, which opened
the transistor era. Information from Pawel E. Tomaszewski Jan Czochralski

on the seed crystal. The seed is rotated during the pulling stage, to obtain a cylindrical ingot. To suppress evaporation from the melt and prevent oxidation, argon gas
is passed through the system.
Initially, as the crystal is withdrawn, its cross-sectional area increases; it then
reaches a constant value determined by the temperature gradients, heat losses, and
the rate of pull. As the melt solidifies on the crystal, heat of fusion is released
and must be conducted away; otherwise, it will raise the temperature of the crystal
and remelt it. The area of the melt–crystal interface determines the rate at which this
heat can be conducted away through the crystal, whereas the rate of pull determines
the rate at which latent heat is released. Although the analysis is not a simple one,
it is clear that to obtain an ingot with a large cross-sectional area, the pull speed
must be slow. Typical growth rates are a few millimeters per minute.

1 .1 2

GLASSES AND AMORPHOUS SEMICONDUCTORS

The sizes and diameters of crystals grown by the Czochralski method are obviously limited by the equipment, though crystals 20–30 cm in diameter and 1–2 m
in length are routinely grown for the IC fabrication industry. Also, the crystal orientation of the seed and its flatness with melt surface are important engineering
requirements. For example, for very large scale integration (VLSI), the seed is placed
with its (100) plane flat to the melt, so that the axis of the cylindrical ingot is along
the [100] direction.
Following growth, the Si ingot is usually ground to a specified diameter. Using
X-ray diffraction, the crystal orientation is identified and either a flat or an edge is
ground along the ingot, as shown in Figure 1.58b. Subsequently, the ingot is cut into
thin wafers by a rotating annular diamond saw. To remove any damage to the wafer
surfaces caused by sawing and obtain flat, parallel surfaces, the wafers are lapped
(ground flat with alumina powder and glycerine), chemically etched, and then polished. The wafers are then used in IC fabrication, usually as a substrate for the growth
of a thin layer of crystal from the vapor phase.
The Czochralski technique is also used for growing Ge, GaAs, and InP single
crystals, though each case has its own particular requirements. The main drawback
of the Czochralski technique is that the final Si crystal inevitably contains oxygen
impurities dissolved from the quartz crucible.

1.12

GLASSES AND AMORPHOUS SEMICONDUCTORS

1.12.1 GLASSES AND AMORPHOUS SOLIDS
A characteristic property of the crystal structure is its periodicity and degree of
symmetry. For each atom, the number of neighbors and their exact orientations are
well defined; otherwise, the periodicity would be lost. There is therefore a long-range
order resulting from strict adherence to a well-defined bond length and relative
bond angle (or exact orientation of neighbors). Figure 1.59a schematically illustrates
the presence of a clear, long-range order in a hypothetical two-dimensional crystal.
Taking an arbitrary origin, we can predict the position of each atom anywhere in the
crystal. We can perhaps use this to represent crystalline SiO2 (silicon dioxide), for
example, in two dimensions. In reality, a Si atom bonds with four oxygen atoms to
form a tetrahedron, and the tetrahedra are linked at the corners to create a threedimensional crystal structure.
Not all solids exhibit crystallinity. Many substances exist in a noncrystalline or
amorphous form, due to their method of formation. For example, SiO2 can have an
amorphous structure, as illustrated schematically in two dimensions in Figure 1.59b.
In the amorphous phase, SiO2 is called vitreous silica, a form of glass, which has
wide engineering applications, including optical fibers. The structure shown in the
figure for vitreous silica is essentially that of a frozen liquid, or a supercooled liquid.
Vitreous silica is indeed readily obtained by cooling the melt.
Many amorphous solids are formed by rapidly cooling or quenching the liquid
to temperatures where the atomic motions are so sluggish that crystallization is
virtually halted. (The cooling rate is measured relative to the crystallization rate,

which depends on atomic diffusion.) We refer to these solids as glasses. In the liquid
state, the atoms have sufficient kinetic energy to break and make bonds frequently
and to bend and twist their bonds. There are bond angle variations, as well as rotations of various atoms around bonds (bond twisting). Thus, the bonding geometry
around each atom is not necessarily identical to that of other atoms, which leads to
the loss of long-range order and the formation of an amorphous structure, as illustrated in Figure 1.59b for the same material in Figure 1.59a. We may view Figure
1.59b as a snapshot of the structure of a liquid. As we move away from a reference
atom, after the first and perhaps the second neighbors, random bending and twisting
of the bonds is sufficient to destroy long-range order. The amorphous structure therefore lacks the long-range order of the crystalline state.
To reach the glassy state, the temperature is rapidly dropped well below the
melting temperature where the atomic diffusion processes needed for arranging the
atoms into a crystalline structure are infinitely slow on the time scale of the observation. The liquid structure thus becomes frozen. Figure 1.59b shows that for an
amorphous structure, the coordination of each atom is well defined, because each
atom must satisfy its chemical bonding requirement, but the whole structure lacks
long-range order. Therefore, there is only a short-range order in an amorphous
solid. The structure is a continuous random network of atoms (often called a CRN
model of an amorphous solid). As a consequence of the lack of long-range order,
amorphous materials do not possess such crystalline imperfections as grain boundaries and dislocations, which is a distinct advantage in certain engineering applications.
Whether a liquid forms a glass or a crystal structure on cooling depends on a
combination of factors, such as the nature of the chemical bond between the atoms
or molecules, the viscosity of the liquid (which determines how easily the atoms move),
the rate of cooling, and the temperature relative to the melting temperature. For

Melt spinning involves squirting a jet of molten metal onto a rotating
cool metal drum. The molten jet is instantly solidified into a glassy
metal ribbon which is a few microns in thickness. The process

example, the oxides SiO2, B2O3, GeO2, and P2O5 have directional bonds that are a
mixture of covalent and ionic bonds and the liquid is highly viscous. These oxides
readily form glasses on cooling from the melt. On the other hand, it is virtually
impossible to quench a pure metal, such as copper, from the melt, bypass crystallization, and form a glass. The metallic bonding is due to an electron gas permeating
the space between the copper ions, and that bonding is nondirectional, which means
that on cooling, copper ions are readily (and hence, quickly) shifted with respect to
each other to form the crystal. There are, however, a number of metal–metal (Cu66Zr33)
and metal–metalloid alloys (Fe80B20, Pd80Si20) that form glasses if quenched at ultrahigh cooling rates of 106–108 °C s−1. In practice, such cooling rates are achieved by
squirting a thin jet of the molten metal against a fast-rotating, cooled copper cylinder.
On impact, the melt is frozen within a few milliseconds, producing a long ribbon of
metallic glass. The process is known as melt spinning and is depicted in Figure 1.60.
Many solids used in various applications have an amorphous structure. The
ordinary window glass (SiO2)0.8(Na2O)0.2 and the majority of glassware are common
examples. Vitreous silica (SiO2) mixed with germania (GeO2) is used extensively in
optical fibers. The insulating oxide layer grown on the Si wafer during IC fabrication
is the amorphous form of SiO2. Some intermetallic alloys, such as Fe0.8B0.2, can be
rapidly quenched from the liquid (as shown in Figure 1.60) to obtain a glassy metal
used in low-loss transformer cores. Arsenic triselenide, As2Se3, has a crystal structure
that resembles the two-dimensional sketch in Figure 1.59a, where an As atom
(valency III) bonds with three Se atoms, and a Se atom (valency VI) bonds with two

87

As atoms. In the amorphous phase, this crystal structure looks like the sketch in
Figure 1.59b, in which the bonding requirements are only locally satisfied. The
crystal can be prepared by condensation from the vapor phase, or by cooling the
melt. Large area films of As2Se3 can be readily deposited from the vapor, and form
one of the layers in multilayer selenium-based X-ray detectors used in mammography.

1.12.2 CRYSTALLINE AND AMORPHOUS SILICON
A silicon atom in the silicon crystal forms four tetrahedrally oriented, covalent bonds
with four neighbors, and the repetition of this exact bonding geometry with a welldefined bond length and angle leads to the diamond structure shown in Figure 1.6.
A simplified two-dimensional sketch of the Si crystal is shown in Figure 1.61. The
crystal has a clear long-range order. Single crystals of Si are commercially grown
by the Czochralski crystal pulling technique.
It is also possible to grow amorphous silicon, denoted by a-Si, by the condensation of Si vapor onto a solid surface, called a substrate. For example, an electron
beam is used to vaporize a silicon target in a vacuum; the Si vapor then condenses
on a metallic substrate to form a thin layer of solid noncrystalline silicon. The technique, which is schematically depicted in Figure 1.62, is referred to as electron beam
deposition. The structure of amorphous Si (a-Si) lacks the long-range order of crystalline Si (c-Si), even though each Si atom in a-Si, on average, prefers to bond with
four neighbors. The difference is that the relative angles between the Si–Si bonds in
a-Si deviate considerably from those in the crystal, which obey a strict geometry.
Therefore, as we move away from a reference atom in a-Si, eventually the periodicity for generating the crystalline structure is totally lost, as illustrated schematically
in Figure 1.61. Furthermore, because the Si–Si bonds do not follow the equilibrium

geometry, the bonds are strained and some are even missing, simply because the
formation of a bond causes substantial bond bending. Consequently, the a-Si structure
has many voids and incomplete bonds, or dangling bonds, as schematically depicted
in Figure 1.61.
One way to reduce the density of dangling bonds is simply to terminate a dangling bond using hydrogen. Since hydrogen only has one electron, it can attach itself
to a dangling bond, that is, passivate the dangling bond. The structure resulting from
hydrogen in amorphous silicon is called hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H).
Many electronic devices, such as a-Si:H solar cells, are based on a-Si being
deposited with H to obtain a-Si:H, in which the hydrogen concentration is typically
10 at.% (atomic %). The process involves the decomposition of silane gas, SiH4, in
an electrical plasma in a vacuum chamber. Called plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
deposition (PECVD), the process is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.63. The
silane gas molecules are dissociated in the plasma, and the Si and H atoms then
condense onto a substrate to form a film of a-Si:H. If the substrate temperature is
too hot, the atoms on the substrate surface will have sufficient kinetic energy, and
hence the atomic mobility, to orient themselves to form a polycrystalline structure.
Typically, the substrate temperature is ∼250 °C. The advantage of a-Si:H is that it can
be grown on large areas, for such applications as photovoltaic cells and flat panel thinfilm transistor (TFT) displays. There are also digital flat panel indirect conversion
X-ray detectors that use a-Si:H TFTs in the detector panel. Table 1.5 summarizes the
properties of crystalline and amorphous silicon, in terms of structure and applications.

SOLID SOLUTIONS AND TWO-PHASE SOLIDS

1.13.1 ISOMORPHOUS SOLID SOLUTIONS: ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS
A phase of a material has the same composition, structure, and properties everywhere, so it is a homogeneous portion of the chemical system under consideration.
In a given chemical system, one phase may be in contact with another phase. For
example, at 0 °C, iced water will have solid and liquid phases in contact. Each phase,
ice and water, has a distinct structure.
A bartender knows that alcohol and water are totally miscible; she can dilute
whisky with as much water as she likes. When the two liquids are mixed, the molecules are randomly mixed with each other and the whole liquid is a homogenous
mixture of the molecules. The liquid therefore has one phase; the properties of the
liquid are the same everywhere. The same is not true when we try to mix water and
oil. The mixture consists of two distinctly separate phases, oil and water, in contact.
Each phase has a different composition, even though both are liquids.
Many solids are a homogeneous mixture of two types of separate atoms. For
example, when nickel atoms are added to copper, Ni atoms substitute directly for the
Cu atoms, and the resulting solid is a solid solution, as depicted in Figure 1.64a.
The structure remains an FCC crystal whatever the amount of Ni we add, from 100%
Cu to 100% Ni. The solid is a homogenous mixture of Cu and Ni atoms, with the
same structure everywhere in the solid solution, which is called an isomorphous
solid solution. The atoms in the majority make up the solvent, whereas the atoms
in the minority are the solute, which is dissolved in the solvent. For a Cu–Ni alloy
with a Ni content of less than 50 at.%, copper is the solvent and nickel is the solute.
The substitution of solute atoms for solvent atoms at various lattice sites of the
solvent can be either random (disordered) or ordered. The two cases are schematically illustrated in Figure 1.64a and b, respectively. In many solid solutions, the
substitution is random, but for certain compositions, the substitution becomes ordered.

({100} planes)

Figure 1.64 Solid solutions can be disordered substitutional, ordered substitutional, and interstitial
substitutional.
Only one phase within the alloy has the same composition, structure, and properties everywhere.

There is a distinct ordering of atoms around each solute atom such that the crystal
structure resembles that of a compound. For example, β′ brass has the composition
50 at.% Cu–50 at.% Zn. Each Zn atom is surrounded by eight Cu atoms and vice
versa, as depicted in two dimensions in Figure 1.64b. The structure is that of a
metallic compound between Cu and Zn.
Another type of solid solution is the interstitial solid solution, in which solute
atoms occupy interstitial sites, or voids between atoms, in the crystal. Figure 1.64c
shows an example in which a small number of carbon atoms have been dissolved in
a γ-iron crystal (FCC) at high temperatures.

1.13.2 PHASE DIAGRAMS: Cu–Ni AND OTHER ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS
The Cu–Ni alloy is isomorphous. Unlike pure copper or pure nickel, when a Cu–Ni
alloy melts, its melting temperature is not well defined. The alloy melts over a range
of temperatures in which both the liquid and the solid coexist as a heterogeneous
mixture. It is therefore instructive to know the phases that exist in a chemical system
at various temperatures as a function of composition, and this need leads to the use
of phase diagrams.
Suppose we take a crucible of molten copper and allow it to cool. Above its
melting temperature (1083 °C), there is only the liquid phase. The temperature drops
with time, as shown in Figure 1.65a, until at the melting or fusion temperature at
point L0 when copper crystals begin to nucleate (solidify) in the crucible. During
solidification, the temperature remains constant. As long as we have both the liquid
and solid phases coexisting, the temperature remains constant at 1083 °C. During
this time, heat is given off as the Cu atoms in the melt attach themselves to the Cu
crystals. This heat is called the heat of fusion. Once all the liquid has solidified
(point S0), the temperature begins to drop as the solid cools. There is therefore a
sharp melting temperature for copper, at 1083 °C.
If we were to cool pure nickel from its melt, we would observe a behavior
similar to that of pure copper, with a well-defined melting temperature at 1453 °C.

Now suppose we cool the melt of a Cu–Ni alloy with a composition22 of 80 wt.%
Cu and 20 wt.% Ni. In the melt, the two species of atoms are totally miscible, and
there is only a single liquid phase. As the cooling proceeds, we reach the temperature
1195 °C, identified as point L20 in Figure 1.65a, where the first crystals of Cu–Ni
alloy begin to appear. In this case, however, the temperature does not remain constant
until the liquid is solidified, but continues to drop. Thus, there is no single melting
temperature, but a range of temperatures over which both the liquid and the solid
phases coexist in a heterogeneous mixture. We find that when the temperature
reaches 1130 °C, corresponding to point S20, all the liquid has solidified. Below
1130 °C, we have a single-phase solid that is an isomorphous solid solution of Cu

and Ni. If we repeat these experiments for other compositions, we find a similar
behavior; that is, freezing occurs over a transition temperature range. The beginning
and end of solidification, at points L and S, respectively, depend on the specific
composition of the alloy.
To characterize the freezing or melting behavior of other compositions of Cu–Ni
alloys, we can plot the temperatures for the beginning and end of solidification versus the composition and identify those temperature regions where various phases
exist, as shown in Figure 1.65b. When we join all the points corresponding to the
beginning of freezing, that is, all the L points, we obtain what is called the liquidus
curve. For any given composition, only the liquid phase can exist above the liquidus
curve. If we join all the points where the liquid has totally solidified, that is, all the
S points, we have a curve called the solidus curve. At any temperature and composition below the solidus curve, we can only have the solid phase. The region between
the liquidus and solidus curves marks where a heterogeneous mixture of liquid and
solid phases exists.
Let’s follow the cooling behavior of the 80% Cu–20% Ni alloy from the melt at
1300 °C down to the solid state at 1000 °C, as shown in Figure 1.66. The vertical
dashed line at 20% Ni represents the overall composition of the alloy (the whole
chemical system) and the cooling process corresponds to movement down this dashed
line, starting from the liquid phase at L0.
When the Cu–Ni alloy begins to solidify at 1195 °C, at point L1, the first solid
that forms is richer in Ni content. The only solid that can exist at this temperature
has a composition S1, which has a greater Ni content than the liquid, as shown in
Figure 1.66. Intuitively, we can see this by noting that Cu, the component with the
lower melting temperature, prefers to remain in the liquid, whereas Ni, which has a

higher melting temperature, prefers to remain in the solid. When the temperature
drops further, say to 1160 °C (indicated by X in the figure), the alloy is a heterogeneous mixture of liquid and solid. At this temperature, the only solid that can coexist with the liquid has a composition S2. The liquid has the composition L2. Since
the liquid has lost some of its Ni atoms, the liquid composition is less than that at
L1. The liquidus and solidus curves therefore give the compositions of the liquid and
solid phases coexisting in the heterogeneous mixture during melting.
At 1160 °C, the overall composition of the alloy (the whole chemical system)
is still 20% Ni and is represented by point X in the phase diagram. When the temperature reaches 1130 °C, nearly all the liquid has been solidified. The solid has the
composition S3, which is 20% Ni, as we expect since the whole alloy is almost all
solid. The last drops of the liquid in the alloy have the composition L3, since at this
temperature, only the liquid with this composition can coexist with the solid at S3.
Table 1.6 summarizes the phases and their compositions, as observed during the
cooling process depicted in Figure 1.66. By convention, all solid phases that can
exist are labeled by different Greek letters. Since we can only have one solid phase,
this is labeled the α-phase.
During the solidification process depicted in Figure 1.66, the solid composition
changes from S1 to S2 to S3. We tacitly assume that the cooling is sufficiently slow
to allow time for atomic diffusion to change the composition of the whole solid.
Therefore, the phase diagram in Figure 1.65b, which assumes near equilibrium conditions during cooling, is termed an equilibrium phase diagram. If the cooling is fast,
there will be limited time for atomic diffusion in the solid phase, and the resulting
solid will have a composition variation. The inner core will correspond to the solidification at S1 and will be Ni rich. Since the solidification occurs quickly, the Ni atoms
do not have time to diffuse out from the inner core to allow the composition in the
solid to change from S1 to S2 to S3. Thus, the outer region, the final solidification,
will be Ni deficient (or Cu rich); its composition is not S3 but less, because S3 is the
average composition in the whole solid. The solid structure will be cored, as depicted
in Figure 1.67. The cooling process is then said to have occurred under nonequilibrium conditions, which leads to a segregation of the elements in the grains. Under
nonequilibrium cooling conditions we cannot quantitatively use the equilibrium phase
diagram in Figure 1.65b. The diagram can only serve as a qualitative guide.

The amounts of liquid and solid in the mixture can be determined from the phase
diagram using the lever rule, which is based on the fact that the total mass of
the alloy remains the same throughout the entire cooling process. Let WL and WS
be the weight (or mass) fraction of the liquid and solid phases in the alloy mixture.
The compositions of the liquid and solid are denoted as CL and CS, respectively. The
overall composition of the alloy is denoted CO, which is the overall weight fraction
of Ni in the alloy.
If we take the alloy to have a weight of unity, then the conservation of mass
means that
WL + WS = 1
Further, the weight fraction of Ni in both the liquid and solid must add up to the
composition CO of Ni in the whole alloy, or
CLWL + CSWS = CO

We can substitute for WS in the above equation to find the weight fraction of the
liquid and then that of the solid phase, as follows:
WL =

CS − CO
CS − CL

and

WS =

CO − CL
CS − CL

[1.43]

To apply Equation 1.43, we first draw a line, called a tie line, from L2 to S2
corresponding to CL and CS, as shown in Figure 1.66. The line represents a “horizontal lever” and point X at CO at this temperature is the lever’s fulcrum. The lengths
of the lever arms from the fulcrum to the liquidus and solidus curves are (CO − CL)
and (CS − CO), respectively. The lever must be balanced by the weights WL and WS
attached to the ends. The total length of the lever is (CS − CL). At 1160 °C,
CL = 0.13 (13% Ni) and CS = 0.28 (28% Ni), so the weight fraction of the liquid
phase is
CS − CO 0.28 − 0.20
=
= 0.533
or
53.3%
WL =
CS − CL 0.28 − 0.13
Similarly, the weight fraction of the solid phase is 1 − 0.533 or 0.467.

the melting temperature. This is similar to the depression of the melting temperature
of pure Ni by the addition of Cu, as shown by the right-hand side of Figure 1.65b.
We can represent the phase diagram of Si with small impurities as shown in Figure 1.68. Consider what happens if we have a rod of the solid and we melt only the
left end by applying heat locally (using RF heating, for example). At the same time,
we move the melted zone toward the right by moving the heater. We therefore melt
the solid at A and refreeze it at B, as shown in Figure 1.69a.
The solid has an impurity concentration of CO; when it melts at A, the melt
initially also has the same concentration CL = CO. However, at temperature TB,
the melt begins to solidify. At the start of solidification the solid that freezes has
a composition CB, which is considerably less than CO, as is apparent in Figure 1.68. The cooling at B occurs rapidly, so the concentration CB cannot adjust
to the equilibrium value at the end of freezing. Thus, the solid that freezes at B
has a lower concentration of impurities. The impurities have been pushed out
of the solid at B and into the melt, whose impurity concentration increases from
CL to CL′.
Next, refreezing at B′, shown in Figure 1.69b, occurs at a lower temperature
TB′, because the melt concentration CL′ is now greater than CO. The solid that
freezes at B′ has the concentration CB′, shown in Figure 1.68, which is greater
than CB but less than CO. As the melted zone is floated toward the right, the melt
that is solidified at B, B′, etc., has a higher and higher impurity concentration,
until its impurity content reaches that of the impure solid, at which point the
concentration remains at CO. When the melted zone approaches the far right where
the freezing is halted, the impurities in the final melt appear in the last frozen
region at the far right. The resulting impurity concentration profile is schematically depicted in Figure 1.69c. The region of impurity concentration below CO is
the zone refined section of the rod. The zone refining procedure can be
repeated again, starting from the left toward the right, to reduce the impurity
concentration even lower. The impurity concentration profile after many passes
is sketched in Figure 1.69d. Although the profile is nonuniform, due to the segregation effect, the impurity concentrations in the zone refined section may be as
low as a factor of 10−6.

1.13.4 BINARY EUTECTIC PHASE DIAGRAMS AND Pb–Sn SOLDERS
When we dissolve salt in water, we obtain a brine solution. If we continue to add
more salt, we eventually reach the solubility limit of salt in the solution, and the
excess salt remains as a solid at the bottom of the container. We then have two coexisting phases: brine (liquid solution) and salt (solid), as shown in Figure 1.70. The
solubility limit of one component in another in a mixture is represented by a solvus
curve shown schematically in Figure 1.70 for salt in brine. In the solid state, there
are many elements that can only be dissolved in small amounts in another solid.
Lead in the solid phase has an FCC crystal structure, and tin has a BCT (bodycentered tetragonal) structure. Although the two elements are totally miscible in any
proportion when melted, this is not so in the solid state. We can only dissolve so
much Sn in solid Pb, and vice versa. We quickly reach the solubility limit, and the

Figure 1.71 The equilibrium phase diagram of the Pb–Sn alloy.
The microstructures on the left show the observations at various points during the cooling of a
90% Pb–10% Sn from the melt along the dashed line (the overall alloy composition remains
constant at 10% Sn).

resulting solid is a mixture of two distinctly different solid phases. One solid phase,
labeled α, is Pb rich and has the FCC structure with some Sn atoms dissolved in the
crystal. The amount of Sn dissolved in α is given by the solvus curve of Sn in α at
that temperature. The other phase, labeled β, is Sn rich and has the BCT structure
with some Pb atoms dissolved in it. The amount of Pb dissolved in β is given by
the solvus curve of Pb in β at that temperature.
The existence of various phases and their compositions as a function of temperature are given by the equilibrium phase diagram for the Pb–Sn alloy, shown in
Figure 1.71. This is called an equilibrium eutectic phase diagram. The liquidus and
solidus curves, as usual, mark the borders for the liquid and solid phases. Between

1 .1 3

SOLID SOLUTIONS AND TWO-PHASE SOLIDS

the liquidus and solidus curves, we have a heterogeneous mixture of melt and solid.
Unlike the Cu–Ni case, the melting temperature of both elements here is depressed
with alloying. The liquidus and solidus curves thus decrease from both ends, starting
at A and B. They meet at a point E, called the eutectic point, at 61.9% Sn and 183 °C.
This point has a special significance: No liquid can exist below this temperature, so
183 °C is the lowest melting temperature of the alloy.
In addition, we must insert the solvus curves at both the Pb and Sn ends to mark
the extent of solid-state solubility and hence identify the two-phase solid region. The
solvus curve for the solubility limit of Sn in Pb meets the solidus curve at point C,
19.2% Sn. Similarly, the solubility limit of Pb in Sn meets the solvus curve at D. A
characteristic feature of this phase diagram is that CD is a straight line through E at
183 °C. Below 183 °C, between the two solvus curves, we have a solid with two
phases, α and β. This is identified as α + β in the diagram.
The usefulness of such a phase diagram is best understood by examining the
phase transformations and microstructures during the cooling of a melt of a given
composition alloy. Consider a 90% Pb–10% Sn alloy being cooled from the melt at
350 °C (point L) where there is only one phase, the liquid phase. At point M, 315 °C,
few nuclei of the α-phase appear in the liquid. The composition of the α-phase is
given by the solidus curve at 315 °C and is about 5% Sn. At point N, 290 °C, there
is more α-phase in the mixture. The compositions of the liquid and α-phases are given
respectively by the liquidus and solidus curves at 290 °C. At point O, 275 °C, all
liquid has been solidified into the α-phase, which then has the composition 10% Sn.
Between M and O, the alloy is a coexistent mixture of the liquid phase (melt)
and the solid α-phase. At point P, 175 °C, we still have only the α-phase. When we
reach the solvus curve at point Q, 140 °C, we can no longer keep all the Sn dissolved
in the α-phase, as we have reached the solubility limit of Sn in α. Some of the Sn
atoms must diffuse out from the α-phase; they do so by forming a second solid phase,
which is the β-phase. The β-phase nucleates within the α-phase (usually at the grain
boundaries, where atomic diffusion occurs readily). The β-phase will contain as
much dissolved Pb as is allowed by the solubility of Pb in the β-phase, which is
given by the solvus curve on the Sn side and marked as point Q′, about 98% Sn.
Thus, the microstructure is now a mixture of the α and β phases.
As cooling proceeds, the two phases continue to coexist, but their relative proportions change. At R, 50 °C, the alloy is a mixture of the α-phase given by R′(4% Sn)
and the β-phase given by R″(99% Sn). The relative amounts of α and β phases are given
by the lever rule. Figure 1.71 illustrates the microstructure of the 90% Pb–10% Sn
alloy as it is cooled.
An interesting phenomenon can be observed when we cool an alloy of the eutectic composition 38.1% Pb–61.9% Sn from the melt. The cooling process and the
observed microstructures are illustrated in Figure 1.72; the microstructures are on the
right. The temperature–time profile is also depicted in Figure 1.72. At point L, 350 °C,
the alloy is all liquid; as it cools, its temperature drops until point E at 183 °C. At E,
the temperature remains constant and a solid phase nucleates within the melt. With
time, the amount of solid grows until all the liquid is solidified and the temperature
begins to drop again. This behavior is much like that of a pure element, for which
melting occurs at a well-defined temperature. This behavior only occurs for the eutectic

composition (61.9% Sn), because this is the composition at which the liquidus and
solidus curves meet at one temperature. Generally, the liquid with the eutectic composition will solidify through the eutectic transformation at the eutectic temperature, or

[1.44]

The solid that forms from the eutectic solidification has a special microstructure,
consisting of alternating plates, or lamellae, of α and β phases, as shown in Figure
1.72. This is called the eutectic microstructure (or eutectic solid). The formation
of a Pb-rich α-phase and an Sn-rich β-phase from the 61.9% Sn liquid requires the
redistribution of the two types of atoms by atomic diffusion. Atomic diffusions are
easier in the liquid than in the solid. The formation of a solid with alternating α and
β layers allows the Pb and Sn atoms to diffuse in the liquid without having to move
over long distances. The eutectic structure is not a phase itself, but a mixture of the
two phases, α and β.

1 .1 3

SOLID SOLUTIONS AND TWO-PHASE SOLIDS

101

When cooled from the melt, an alloy with a composition between 19.2% Sn and
61.9% Sn solidifies into a mixture of α-phase and a eutectic solid (a mixture of α and
β phases). Consider the cooling of an alloy with a composition of 40% Sn, starting
from the liquid phase L at 350 °C, as shown in Figure 1.72. At point M (235 °C), the
first solid, the α-phase, nucleates. Its composition is about 15% Sn. At N, 210 °C, the
alloy is a mixture of liquid, composition 50% Sn, and α-phase, composition 18% Sn.
The composition of the liquid thus moves along the liquidus line from M toward E.
At 183 °C, the liquid has the composition 61.9% Sn, or the eutectic composition, and
therefore undergoes the eutectic transformation indicated in Equation 1.44. There is
still α-phase in the alloy, but its composition is now 19.2% Sn; it does not take part
in the eutectic transformation of the liquid. During the eutectic transformation, the
temperature remains constant. When all the liquid has been solidified, we have a mixture of the preexisting α-phase, called primary α (or proeutectic α), and the newly
formed eutectic solid. The final microstructure is shown in Figure 1.72 and consists
of a primary α and a eutectic solid; therefore, two solid phases, α and β, coexist.
During cooling between points M and O, the alloy 60% Pb–40% Sn is a mixture
of melt and α-phase, and it exhibits plastic-like characteristics while solidifying.
Further, the temperature range for the solidification is about 183–235 °C, or about
50 °C. Such an alloy is preferable for such uses as soldering wiped joints to join
pipes together, giving the plumber sufficient play for adjusting and wiping the joint.
On the other hand, a solder with the eutectic composition (commercially, this is 40%
Pb–60% Sn solder, which is close to the eutectic) has the lowest melting temperature
and solidifies quickly. The liquid also has good wetting properties. Therefore, 40%
Pb–60% Sn is widely used for soldering semiconductor devices, where good wetting
and minimal exposure to high temperature are required.
THE 60% Pb–40% Sn ALLOY Consider the solidification of the 60% Pb–40% Sn alloy.
What are the phases, compositions, and weight fractions of various phases existing in the
alloy at 250, 210, 183.5 ( just above 183 °C), and 182.5 °C (just below 183 °C)?
SOLUTION

We again refer to the phase diagram in Figure 1.72 to identify which phases exist at what
temperatures. At 250 °C, we only have the liquid phase. At 210 °C, point N, the liquid and
the α-phase are in equilibrium. The composition of the α-phase is given by the solidus line;
at 210 °C, Cα = 18% Sn. The composition of the liquid is given by the liquidus line; at
210 °C, CL = 50% Sn. To find the weight fraction of α in the alloy, we use the lever rule,
Wα =

CL − CO 50 − 40
=
= 0.313
CL − Cα 50 − 18

From Wα + WL = 1, we obtain the weight fraction of the liquid phase, WL = 1 − 0.313 = 0.687.
At 183.5 °C, point O, the composition of the α-phase is 19.2% Sn corresponding to C
and that of the liquid is 61.9% Sn corresponding to E. The liquid therefore has the eutectic
composition. The weight fractions are
Wα =

CL − CO
61.9 − 40
=
= 0.513
CL − Cα 61.9 − 19.2

WL = 1 − 0.513 = 0.487

As expected, the amount of α-phase increases during solidification; at the same time, its
composition changes along the solidus curve. Just above 183 °C, about half the alloy is the
solid α-phase and the other half is liquid with the eutectic composition. Thus, on solidification, the liquid undergoes the eutectic transformation and forms the eutectic solid. Just below
183 °C, therefore, the microstructure is the primary α-phase and the eutectic solid. Stated
differently, below 183 °C, the α and β phases coexist, and β is in the eutectic structure. The
weight fraction of the eutectic phase is the same as that of the liquid just above 183 °C, from
which it was formed. The weight fractions of α and β in the whole alloy are given by the

The microstructure at room temperature will be much like that just below 183 °C, at
which the alloy is a two phase solid because atomic diffusions in the solid will not be sufficiently fast to allow the compositions to change. Table 1.7 summarizes the phases that exist
in this alloy at various temperatures.

BRAVAIS LATTICES

An infinite periodic array of geometric points in space defines a space lattice or
simply a lattice. Strictly, a lattice does not contain any atoms or molecules because
it is simply an imaginary array of geometric points. A two-dimensional simple square
lattice is shown in Figure 1.73a. In three dimensions, Figure 1.73a would correspond
to the simple cubic (SC) lattice. The actual crystal is obtained from the lattice by
placing an identical group of atoms (or molecules) at each lattice point. The identical group of atoms is called the basis of the crystal structure. Thus, conceptually,

as illustrated in Figure 1.73a to c,
Crystal = Lattice + Basis

The unit cell of the two-dimensional lattice in Figure 1.73a is a square which is
characterized by the length a of one of the sides; a is called a lattice parameter.
A given lattice can generate different patterns of atoms depending on the basis. The
lattice in Figure 1.73a with the two-atom basis in Figure 1.73b produces the crystal
in Figure 1.73c. Although the latter crystal appears as a body-centered square (similar to BCC in three dimensions), it is nonetheless a simple square lattice with two
atoms comprising the basis. Suppose that the basis had only one atom; then the
crystal would appear as the simple square lattice in Figure 1.73a (with each point
now being an atom). The patterns in Figure 1.73a and c are different but the underlying lattice is the same. Because they have the same lattice, the two crystals would
have certain identical symmetries. For example, for both crystals, a rotation by 90°
about a lattice point would produce the same crystal structure.
To fully characterize the crystal, we also have to specify the locations of the basis
atoms in the unit cell as in Figure 1.73d. By convention, we place a Cartesian coordinate
system at the rear-left corner of the unit cell with the x and y axes along the square
edges. We indicate the coordinates (xi, yi) of each ith atom in terms of the lattice
parameters along x and y. Thus, the atoms in the unit cell in Figure 1.73d are at (0, 0)
and at ( 12, 21 ). The CsCl unit cell in Figure 1.39 appears as BCC, but it can be described
by a SC lattice and a basis that has one Cl− ion and one Cs+ ion. The ions in the SC
unit cell are located at (0, 0, 0) and at the cell center at ( 21, 12, 12 ). Similarly, the NaCl
crystal in Figure 1.38 is an FCC lattice with a basis of Na+ and Cl− ions.
The diamond unit cell of silicon is an FCC lattice with two Si atoms constituting the basis. The two Si atoms are placed at (0, 0, 0) and ( 14, 41, 14 ). Most of the
important III–V compound semiconductors such as GaAs, AlAs, InAs, InP, etc.,
which are widely used in numerous optoelectronic devices, have the zinc blende

(ZnS) unit cell. The zinc blende unit cell consists of an FCC lattice and a basis that
has the Zn and S atoms placed at (0, 0, 0) and ( 14, 14, 41 ), respectively.
We generally represent the geometry of the unit cell of a lattice as a parallelepiped with sides a, b, c and angles α, β, γ as depicted in Figure 1.41a. In the case
of copper and iron, the geometry of the unit cell has a = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°,
and cubic symmetry. For Zn, the unit cell has hexagonal geometry with a = b ≠ c,
α = β = 90°, and γ = 120° as shown in Figure 1.34d. Based on different lattice
parameters, there are seven possible distinct unit-cell geometries, which we call

crystal systems each with a particular distinct symmetry. The seven crystal systems
are depicted in Figure 1.74 with typical examples. We are already familiar with the
cubic and hexagonal systems. The seven crystal systems only categorize the unit
cells based on the geometry of the unit cell and not in terms of the symmetry and
periodicity of the lattice points. (One should not confuse the unit-cell geometry with
the lattice, which is a periodic array of points.) In the cubic system, for example,
there are three possible distinct lattices corresponding to SC, BCC, and FCC which
are shown in Figure 1.74. All three have the same cubic geometry: a = b = c and
α = β = γ = 90°.
Many distinctly different lattices, or distinct patterns of points, exist in three
dimensions. There are 14 distinct lattices whose unit cells have one of the seven
geometries as indicated in Figure 1.74. Each of these is called a Bravais lattice.
The copper crystal, for example, has the FCC Bravais lattice, but arsenic, antimony, and bismuth crystals have the rhombohedral Bravais lattice. Tin’s unit cell
belongs to the tetragonal crystal system, and its crystal lattice is a body-centered
tetragonal (BCT).

GRÜNEISEN’S RULE23

We considered thermal expansion in Section 1.4.2 where the principle is illustrated
in Figure 1.18, which shows the potential energy curve U(r) for two atoms separated by a distance r in a crystal. At temperature T1, we know that the atoms will
be vibrating about their equilibrium positions between positions B and C, compressing (B) and stretching (C) the bond between them. The line BC corresponds
to the total energy E of the pair of atoms. The average separation at T1 is at A,
halfway between B and C. We also know that the PE curve U(r) is asymmetric,
and it is this asymmetry that leads to the phenomenon of thermal expansion. When
the temperature increases from T1 to T2, the atoms vibrate between B′ and C′ and
the average separation between the atoms also increases, from A to A′, which we
identified as thermal expansion. If the PE curve were symmetric, then there would
be no thermal expansion.
Since the linear expansion coefficient λ is related to shape of the PE curve,
U(r), it is also related to the elastic modulus, E. Further, λ also depends on the
amount of increase from BC to B′C′ per degree of increase in the temperature. λ
must therefore also depend on the heat capacity. When the temperature increases
by a small amount δT, the energy per atom increases by (Cv δT )∕N, where Cv is
the heat capacity per unit volume and N is the number of atoms per unit volume.
If Cv δT is large, then the line B′C′ in Figure 1.18 will be higher up on the energy
curve and the average separation A′ will therefore be larger. Thus, the larger is the
heat capacity, the greater is the interatomic separation, which means λ ∝ Cv. Further, the average separation, point A, depends on how much the bonds are stretched
and compressed. For large amounts of displacement from equilibrium, the average A

Grüneisen’s rule is also referred as Grüneisen’s law or theorem. Eduard Grüneisen reported in his paper
“Theorie des festen Zustandes einatomiger Elemente” in Annalen der Physik in 1912 in Germany.

will be greater as more asymmetry of the PE curve is used. Thus, the smaller
is the elastic modulus E, the greater is λ, that is, λ ∝ 1∕E. The dependence of λ
on Cv and E can be written as λ ∝ Cv∕E. Atomic vibrations occur in three dimensions for which a more appropriate elastic constant that would describe the compression and stretching of bonds would be K, the bulk modulus, rather than E.
Thus, λ ∝ Cv∕K.
If we were to expand U(r) about its minimum value Umin at r = ro, we would
obtain the Taylor expansion
Atomic PE in
the crystal

U(r) = Umin + a2(r − ro)2 + a3(r − ro)3 + …

[1.45]

where a2 and a3 are coefficients related to second and third order derivatives of U
at ro. The term (r − ro) is missing because we are expanding a series about Umin
where dU∕dr = 0. The terms Umin and a2(r − ro)2 give a parabola about Umin, which
is a symmetric curve around ro and therefore does not lead to thermal expansion.
Average location at any energy on a symmetric curve at ro is always at ro. It is the
a3 term that gives the expansion because it leads to asymmetry. Thus, the amount
of expansion λ also depends on the amount of asymmetry with respect to symmetry,
that is a3∕a2. Thus

The ratio of a3 and a2 depends on the nature of the bond. A simplified analytical treatment gives
Grüneisen’s
law

λ=

γG

[1.47]

where γG is an apparent “constant,” called the Grüneisen parameter. The Grüneisen
parameter γG is approximately −(roa3)∕(2a2), where ro is the equilibrium atomic
separation, and thus γG represents the asymmetry of the energy curve. The
Grüneisen parameter γG is typically of the order of unity for many materials.
Since αV = 3λ is the volume expansion coefficient, Equation [1.47] simplifies to
αV = γGCv∕K.
The asymmetric PE curve in Figure 1.18 has a finite cubic a3 term as in Equation 1.45, which means that the atomic vibrations do not execute a perfect simple
harmonic (sinusoidal) vibration about ro; because the restoring force is not proportional to the displacement alone. Such oscillations are unharmonic and the PE curve
is said to possess an unharmonicity (terms such as a3). Thermal expansion is an
unharmonic effect.
There is another way to look at Equation 1.47. This equation can also be used
to define γG in terms of the ratio 3λK∕Cv. This ratio is then an indicator of
the extent of asymmetry in the bonding, the a3∕a2 ratio. The question whether
this ratio is a practically useful parameter depends on how much γG varies among
different types of solids, or within a given class of solids. Table 1.8 summarizes
the γG for a selection of materials that have different types of bonding; notice that
the magnitude of γG is on the order of unity.

DEFINING TERMS
Activated state is the state that occurs temporarily
during a transformation or reaction when the reactant
atoms or molecules come together to form a particular
arrangement (intermediate between reactants and
products) that has a higher potential energy than the
reactants. The potential energy barrier between the activated state and the reactants is the activation energy.
Activation energy is the potential energy barrier
against the formation of a product. In other words, it is
the minimum energy that the reactant atom or molecule must have to be able to reach the activated state
and hence form a product.
Amorphous solid is a solid that exhibits no crystalline structure or long-range order. It only possesses a
short-range order in the sense that the nearest neighbors of an atom are well defined by virtue of chemical
bonding requirements.
Anion is an atom that has gained negative charge by
virtue of accepting one or more electrons. Usually, atoms of nonmetallic elements can gain electrons easily
to become anions. Anions become attracted to the anode (positive terminal) in ionic conduction. Typical
anions are the halogen ions F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−.
Atomic mass (or relative atomic mass or atomic
weight) Mat of an element is the average atomic

mass, in atomic mass units (amu), of all the naturally
occurring isotopes of the element. Atomic masses are
listed in the Periodic Table. The amount of an element that has 6.022 × 1023 atoms (the Avogadro number of atoms) has a mass in grams equal to the atomic
mass.
Atomic mass unit (amu) is a convenient mass measurement equal to one-twelfth of the mass of a neutral
carbon atom that has a mass number of A = 12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons). It has been found that amu =
1.66054 × 1027 kg, which is equivalent to 10−3∕NA,
where NA is Avogadro’s number.
Atomic packing factor (APF) is the fraction of volume actually occupied by atoms in a crystal.
Avogadro’s number (NA) is the number of atoms in
exactly 12 g of carbon-12. It is 6.022 × 1023. Since
atomic mass is defined as one-twelfth of the mass of
the carbon-12 atom, the NA number of atoms of any
substance has a mass equal to the atomic mass Mat,
in grams.
Basis represents an atom, a molecule, or a collection
of atoms, that is placed at each lattice point to generate
the true crystal structure of a substance. All crystals are
thought of as a lattice with each point occupied by
a basis.

ELEMENTARY MATERIALS SCIENCE CONCEPTS

Bond energy or binding energy is the work (or energy) needed to separate two atoms infinitely from
their equilibrium separation in the molecule or solid.
Bulk modulus K is volume stress (pressure) needed per
unit elastic volume strain and is defined by p = −KΔ,
where p is the applied volume stress (pressure) and Δ
is the volume strain. K indicates the extent to which a
body can be reversibly (and hence elastically) deformed
in volume by an applied pressure.
Cation is an atom that has gained positive charge by
virtue of losing one or more electrons. Usually, metal
atoms can lose electrons easily to become cations.
Cations become attracted to the cathode (negative
terminal) in ionic conduction, as in gaseous discharge. The alkali metals, Li, Na, K, . . . , easily
lose their valence electron to become cations, Li+,
Na+, K+, . . .
Coordination number is the number of nearest
neighbors around a given atom in the crystal.
Covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons between two atoms. For example, in H2, the two
hydrogen atoms share their electrons, so that each has
a closed shell.
Crystal is a three-dimensional periodic arrangement
of atoms, molecules, or ions. A characteristic property
of the crystal structure is its periodicity and a degree of
symmetry. For each atom, the number of neighbors and
their exact orientations are well defined; otherwise the
periodicity will be lost. Therefore, a long-range order
results from strict adherence to a well-defined bond
length and relative bond angle (that is, exact orientation of neighbors).
Crystallization is a process by which crystals of a
substance are formed from another phase of that substance. Examples are solidification just below the fusion temperature from the melt, or condensation of the
molecules from the vapor phase onto a substrate. The
crystallization process initially requires the formation
of small crystal nuclei, which contain a limited number
(perhaps 103–104) of atoms or molecules of the substance. Following nucleation, the nuclei grow by
atomic diffusion from the melt or vapor.
Diffusion is the migration of atoms by virtue of their
random thermal motions.

Diffusion coefficient is a measure of the rate at which
atoms diffuse. The rate depends on the nature of the
diffusion process and is typically temperature dependent.
The diffusion coefficient is defined as the magnitude
of diffusion flux density per unit concentration gradient.
Dislocation is a line imperfection within a crystal that
extends over many atomic distances.
Edge dislocation is a line imperfection within a crystal that occurs when an additional, short plane of atoms
does not extend as far as its neighbors. The edge of this
short plane constitutes a line of atoms where the bonding is irregular, that is, a line of imperfection called an
edge dislocation.
Elastic modulus or Young’s modulus (Y) is a measure of the ease with which a solid can be elastically
deformed. The greater Y is, the more difficult it is to
deform the solid elastically. When a solid of length ℓ is
subjected to a tensile stress σ (force per unit area), the
solid will extend elastically by an amount δℓ where
δℓ∕ℓ is the strain ε. Stress and strain are related by
σ = Yε, so Y is the stress needed per unit elastic strain.
Electric dipole moment is formed when a positive
charge +Q is separated from a negative charge −Q of
equal magnitude. Even though the net charge is zero,
there is nonetheless an electric dipole moment formed
by the two charges −Q and +Q being separated by a
finite distance. Just as two charges exert a Coulombic
force on each other, two dipoles also exert an electrostatic force on each other that depends on the separation of dipoles and their relative orientation.
Electron affinity represents the energy that is needed
to add an electron to a neutral atom to create a negative
ion (anion). When an electron is added to Cl to form
Cl−, energy is actually released.
Electronegativity is a relative measure of the ability
of an atom to attract the electrons in a bond it forms
with another atom. The Pauling scale of electronegativity assigns an electronegativity value (a pure number) X to various elements, the highest being 4 for F,
and the lowest values being for the alkali metal atoms,
for which X are less than 1. The difference XA − XB in
the electronegativities of two atoms A and B is a measure of the polar or ionic character of the bond A–B
between A and B. A molecule A–B would be polar, that
is, possess a dipole moment, if XA and XB are different.

DEFINING TERMS
Equilibrium between two systems requires mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium. Mechanical
equilibrium means that the pressure should be the same
in the two systems, so that one does not expand at the
expense of the other. Thermal equilibrium implies that
both have the same temperature. Equilibrium within a
single-phase substance (e.g., steam only or hydrogen
gas only) implies uniform pressure and temperature
within the system.
Equilibrium state of a system is the state in which the
pressure and temperature in the system are uniform
throughout. We say that the system possesses mechanical and thermal equilibrium.
Eutectic composition is an alloy composition of two
elements that results in the lowest melting temperature
compared to any other composition. A eutectic solid
has a structure that is a mixture of two phases. The
eutectic structure is usually special, such as alternating
lamellae.
Face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice is a cubic lattice
that has one lattice point at each corner of a cube and
one at the center of each face. If there is a chemical
species (atom or a molecule) at each lattice point, then
the structure is an FCC crystal structure.
Frenkel defect is an ionic crystal imperfection that
occurs when an ion moves into an interstitial site,
thereby creating a vacancy in its original site. The imperfection is therefore a pair of point defects.

contact with a cold body, energy is transferred from the
hot body to the cold one. The energy that is transferred
is the excess mean kinetic energy of the molecules in
the hot body. Molecules in the hot body have a higher
mean kinetic energy and vibrate more violently. As a
result of the collisions between the molecules, there is
a net transfer of energy (heat) from the hot body to the
cold one, until the molecules in both bodies have the
same mean kinetic energy, that is, until their temperatures become equal.
Heat capacity at constant volume is the increase in
the total energy E of the system per degree increase in
the temperature of the system with the volume remaining constant: C = (∂E∕∂T )V. Thus, the heat added to
the system does no mechanical work due to a volume
change but increases the internal energy. Molar heat
capacity is the heat capacity for 1 mole of a substance.
Specific heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit
mass.
Interstitial site (interstice) is an unoccupied space
between the atoms (or ions, or molecules) in a crystal.
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an
electron from a neutral atom; normally the most outer
electron that has the least binding energy to the nucleus
is removed to ionize an atom.
Isomorphous describes a structure that is the same
everywhere (from iso, uniform, and morphology
structure).

Flux density is the rate of flow of particles in a particular direction per unit area.

Isotropic substance is a material that has the same
property in all directions.

Grain is an individual crystal within a polycrystalline
material. Within a grain, the crystal structure and orientation are the same everywhere and the crystal is
oriented in one direction only.

Kinetic molecular theory assumes that the atoms and
molecules of all substances (gases, liquids, and solids)
above absolute zero of temperature are in constant motion. Monatomic molecules (e.g., He, Ne) in a gas exhibit constant and random translational motion,
whereas the atoms in a solid exhibit constant vibrational motion.

Grain boundary is a surface region between differently oriented, adjacent grain crystals. The grain
boundary contains a lattice mismatch between adjacent
grains.
Heat is the amount of energy transferred from one
system to another (or between the system and its surroundings) as a result of a temperature difference. Heat
is not a new form of energy, but rather the transfer of
energy from one body to another by virtue of the random motions of their molecules. When a hot body is in

Lattice is a regular array of points in space with a
discernible periodicity. There are 14 distinct lattices
possible in three-dimensional space. When an atom or
molecule is placed at each lattice point, the resulting
regular structure is a crystal structure.
Lattice parameters are (a) the lengths of the sides of
the unit cell, and (b) the angles between the sides.

Mean free path is the mean distance a molecule in a
gas travels freely before it collides with another molecule. The mean free path depends on the concentration
of molecules, which depends on the pressure and temperature.

structure, and properties everywhere. In a given chemical system, one phase may be in contact with another
phase of the system. For example, iced water at 0 °C will
have solid and liquid phases in contact. Each phase,
solid ice and liquid water, has a distinct structure.

Mechanical work is qualitatively defined as the energy expended in displacing a constant force through a
distance. When a force F is moved a distance dx, work
done dW = F · dx. When we lift a body such as an apple of mass m (100 g) by a distance h (1 m), we do
work by an amount F Δx = mgh (1 J), which is then
stored as the gravitational potential energy of the body.
We have transferred energy from ourselves to the potential energy of the body by exchanging energy with it
in the form of work. Further, in lifting the apple, the
molecules have been displaced in orderly fashion, all
upwards. Work therefore involves an orderly displacement of atoms and molecules of a substance in complete contrast to heat. When the volume V of a substance
changes by dV when the pressure is P, the mechanical
work involved is P dV and is called the PV work.

Phase diagram is a temperature versus composition
diagram in which the existence and coexistence of various phases are identified by regions and lines. Between the liquidus and solidus lines, for example, the
material is a heterogeneous mixture of the liquid and
solid phases.

Metallic bonding is the binding of metal atoms in a
crystal through the attraction between the positive
metal ions and the mobile valence electrons in the crystal. The valence electrons permeate the space between
the ions.
Miller indices (hkℓ) are indices that conveniently
identify parallel planes in a crystal. Consider a plane
with the intercepts, x1, y1, and z1, in terms of lattice
parameters a, b, and c. (For a plane passing through the
origin, we shift the origin or use a parallel plane.)
Then, (hkℓ) are obtained by taking the reciprocals of
x1, y1, and z1, and clearing all fractions.
Miscibility of two substances is a measure of the mutual solubility of those two substances when they are in
the same phase, such as liquid.
Mole of a substance is that amount of the substance
that contains NA number of atoms (or molecules),
where NA is Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023). One
mole of a substance has a mass equal to its atomic (molecular) mass, in grams. For example, 1 mole of copper
contains 6.023 × 1023 atoms and has a mass of 63.55 g.
Phase of a system is a homogeneous portion of
the chemical system that has the same composition,

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) involves the heating and evaporation of a source material in a vacuum
chamber so that the vapor can be condensed onto a
substrate of choice, placed facing the source. The result
is a thin film of the source material on the substrate.
Planar concentration of atoms is the number of atoms per unit area on a given (hkℓ) plane in a crystal.
Polarization is the separation of positive and negative charges in a system, which results in a net electric
dipole moment.
Polymorphism or allotropy is a material attribute
that allows the material to possess more than one crystal structure. Each possible crystal structure is called a
polymorph. Generally, the structure of the polymorph
depends on the temperature and pressure, as well as on
the method of preparation of the solid. (For example,
diamond can be prepared from graphite by the application of very high pressures.)
Primary bond is a strong interatomic bond, typically
greater then l eV/atom, that involves ionic, covalent, or
metallic bonding.
Property is a system characteristic or an attribute that
we can measure. Pressure, volume, temperature, mass,
energy, electrical resistivity, magnetization, polarization, and color are all properties of matter. Properties
such as pressure, volume, and temperature can only be
attributed to a system of many particles (which we treat
as a continuum). Note that heat and work are not properties of a substance; instead, they represent energy transfers involved in producing changes in the properties.
Saturated solution is a solution that has the maximum
possible amount of solute dissolved in a given amount
of solvent at a specified temperature and pressure.

per unit original volume.

Screw dislocation is a crystal defect that occurs when
one portion of a perfect crystal is twisted or skewed
with respect to another portion on only one side of
a line.

Stress is force per unit area. When the applied force F
is perpendicular to the area A, stress σ = F∕A is either
tensile or compressive. If the applied force is tangential
to the area, then stress is shear stress, τ = F∕A.

Secondary bond is a weak bond, typically less than
0.1 eV/atom, which is due to dipole–dipole interactions between the atoms or molecules.

Thermal expansion is the change in the length or volume of a substance due to a change in the temperature.
Linear coefficient of thermal expansion λ is the
fractional change in the length per unit temperature

Solvent is the major chemical component of a solution.
Stoichiometric compounds are compounds with an
integer ratio of atoms, as in CaF2, in which two fluorine atoms bond with one calcium atom.
Strain is a relative measure of the deformation a material exhibits under an applied stress. Under an applied tensile (or compressive) stress, strain ε is the
change in the length per unit original length. When a
shear stress is applied, the deformation involves a shear
angle. Shear strain is the tangent of the shear angle

Unit cell is the most convenient small cell in a crystal

The repetition of the unit cell in three dimensions generates the whole crystal structure.
Vacancy is a point defect in a crystal, where a normally

Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer shell

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
1.1

Virial theorem The Li atom has a nucleus with a +3e positive charge, which is surrounded by a
full 1s shell with two electrons, and a single valence electron in the outer 2s subshell. The atomic
radius of the Li atom is about 0.17 nm. Using the Virial theorem, and assuming that the valence
electron sees the nuclear +3e shielded by the two 1s electrons, that is, a net charge of +e, estimate
the ionization energy of Li (the energy required to free the 2s electron). Compare this value with the
experimental value of 5.39 eV. Suppose that the actual nuclear charge seen by the valence electron
is not +e but a little higher, say +1.25e, due to the imperfect shielding provided by the closed 1s shell.
What would be the new ionization energy? What is your conclusion?

Mean atomic separation, surface concentration, and density There are many instances where we
only wish to use reasonable estimates for the mean separation between the host atoms in a crystal
and the mean separation between impurities in the crystal. These can be related in a simple way to
the atomic concentration of the host atoms and atomic concentration of the impurity atoms, respectively. The final result does not depend on the sample geometry or volume. Sometimes, we need to

Degrees of freedom in a gas molecule A monatomic molecule such as Ar has only three degrees of
freedom (DOF) for motion along the three independent directions x, y, and z. In a system in which
there are two independent atoms such Cl and Cl, the total number of DOF f is 6 because each atom
has 3 degrees of freedom. Once we form a Cl2 molecule, the original 6 DOF in KE are partitioned
as shown in Figure 1.78. The Cl2 molecule has 3 translational degrees of freedom, 2 rotational and 1
vibrational, summing to the original 6. The vibrational degree of freedom itself has KE and PE terms
with each having an average of 12 kT so that a vibrational degree of freedom actually has kT of energy
rather than 12 kT. The PE term arises from the stretching and compression of the bond (which acts
like a spring) during the vibrations. Put differently, each vibrational DOF has two “subdegrees” of
freedom associated with KE and PE terms, each of which has an average of (1∕2)kT of energy. Let
na be the number of atoms in a molecule. Then 3na is the total number of kinetic energy based DOF.
There will always be 3 translational DOF for the molecule and at most 3 rotational degrees of freedom.
There may be one or more vibrational DOF because there may be many ways in which the atoms in

The actual description is quite involved. The electrons in the gas would be moving around randomly and at the
same time accelerating due to the presence of an applied field. We will examine this in Chapter 2. Further, the
approach in this question is highly simplified to highlight the concept and find very rough estimates rather than
carry out accurate calculations. In fact, the cross section that is involved in the ionization of an Ar atom is smaller
than the actual cross section of the Ar atom, because the projectile electron may not necessarily ionize the
Ar atom during its interactions with it. (The cross section also depends on the energy of the electron.)

Electrical and Thermal
Conduction in Solids:
Mainly Classical Concepts

Electrical conduction involves the motion of charges in a material under the influence of an applied electric field. A material can generally be classified as a conductor if it contains a large number of “free” or mobile charge carriers. In metals, due
to the nature of metallic bonding, the valence electrons from the atoms form a sea
of electrons that are free to move within the metal and are therefore called conduction electrons. In this chapter, we will treat the conduction electrons in metal as “free
charges” that can be accelerated by an applied electric field. In the presence of an
electric field, the conduction electrons attain an average velocity, called the drift
velocity, that depends on the field. By applying Newton’s second law to electron
motion and using such concepts as mean free time between electron collisions with
lattice vibrations, crystal defects, impurities, etc., we will derive the fundamental
equations that govern electrical conduction in solids. A key concept will be the drift
mobility, which is a measure of the ease with which charge carriers in the solid drift
under the influence of an external electric field.
Good electrical conductors, such as metals, are also known to be good thermal
conductors. The conduction of thermal energy from higher to lower temperature
regions in a metal involves the conduction electrons carrying the energy. Consequently, there is an innate relationship between the electrical and thermal conductivities, which is supported by theory and experiments.

The electric current density J is defined as the net amount of charge flowing across
a unit area per unit time, that is,

where Δq is the net quantity of charge flowing through an area A in time Δt.
Figure 2.1 shows the net flow of electrons in a conductor section of cross-sectional
area A in the presence of an applied field Ex. Notice that the direction of electron
motion is opposite to that of the electric field Ex and of conventional current,
because the electrons experience a Coulombic force eEx in the x direction, due to
their negative charge.
We know that the conduction electrons are actually moving around randomly1
in the metal, but we will assume that as a result of the application of the electric
field Ex, they all acquire a net velocity in the x direction. Otherwise, there would be
no net flow of charge through area A.
The average velocity of the electrons in the x direction at time t is denoted vdx(t).
This is called the drift velocity, which is the instantaneous velocity vx in the x direction averaged over many electrons (perhaps, ∼1028 m−3); that is
Definition of
drift velocity

vdx =

where vxi is the x direction velocity of the ith electron, and N is the number of conduction electrons in the metal. Suppose that n is the number of electrons per unit volume
in the conductor (n = N∕V). In time Δt, electrons move a distance Δx = vdx Δt, so
the total charge Δq crossing the area A is enA Δx. This is valid because all the
electrons within distance Δx pass through A; thus, n(A Δx) is the total number of
electrons crossing A in time Δt.
The current density in the x direction is

This general equation relates Jx to the average velocity vdx of the electrons. It must
be appreciated that the average velocity at one time may not be the same as at another
time, because the applied field, for example, may be changing: Ex = Ex(t). We therefore allow for a time-dependent current by writing
Jx(t) = envdx(t)

[2.2]

To relate the current density Jx to the electric field Ex, we must examine the
effect of the electric field on the motion of the electrons in the conductor. To do so,
we will consider the copper crystal.

All the conduction electrons are “free” within the metal and move around randomly, being scattered from
vibrating metal ions, as we discuss in this chapter.

Electrons drift with an average velocity vdx

The copper atom has a single valence electron in its 4s subshell, and this electron
is loosely bound. The solid metal consists of positive ion cores, Cu+, at regular sites,
in the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The valence electrons detach
themselves from their parents and wander around freely in the solid, forming a kind
of electron cloud or gas. These mobile electrons are free to respond to an applied
field, creating a current density Jx. The valence electrons in the electron gas are
therefore conduction electrons.
The attractive forces between the negative electron cloud and the Cu+ ions are
responsible for metallic bonding and the existence of the solid metal. (This simplistic view of metal was depicted in Figure 1.7 for copper.) The electrostatic attraction
between the conduction electrons and the positive metal ions, like the electrostatic
attraction between the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom, results in the
conduction electron having both potential energy PE and kinetic energy KE. The
conduction electrons move about the crystal lattice in the same way that gas atoms
move randomly in a cylinder. Although the average KE for gas atoms is 32 kT , this is
not the case for electrons in a metal, because these electrons strongly interact with
the metal ions and with each other as a result of electrostatic interactions.
The mean KE of the conduction electrons in a metal is primarily determined
by the electrostatic interaction of these electrons with the positive metal ions and
also with each other. For most practical purposes, we will therefore neglect the
temperature dependence of the mean KE compared with other factors that control
the behavior of the conduction electrons in the metal crystal. We can speculate
from Example 1.1, that the magnitude of mean KE must be comparable to the
magnitude of the mean PE of electrostatic interaction2 or, stated differently, to the
metal bond energy which is several electron volts per atom. If u is the mean speed
of the conduction electrons, then, from electrostatic interactions alone, we expect
1
2
6
−1
2 meu to be several electron volts which means that u is typically ∼10 m s . This
purely classical and intuitive reasoning is not sufficient, however, to show that the
mean speed u is relatively temperature insensitive and much greater than that
expected from kinetic molecular theory. The true reasons are quantum mechanical
and are discussed in Chapter 4. (They arise from what is called the Pauli exclusion
principle.)

2

There is a theorem in classical mechanics called the virial theorem, which states that for a collection of
particles, the mean KE has half the magnitude of the mean PE if the only forces acting on the particles are
such that they follow an inverse square law dependence on the particle–particle separation (as in Coulombic
and gravitational forces).

V
(b) In the presence of an applied field, Ex, there
is a net drift along the x direction. This net drift
along the force of the field is superimposed on
the random motion of the electron. After many
scattering events the electron has been displaced
by a net distance, Δx, from its initial position
toward the positive terminal.

Figure 2.2 Motion of a conduction electron in a metal.

In general, the copper crystal will not be perfect and the atoms will not be stationary. There will be crystal defects, vacancies, dislocations, impurities, etc., which
will scatter the conduction electrons. More importantly, due to their thermal energy,
the atoms will vibrate about their lattice sites (equilibrium positions), as depicted
in Figure 2.2a. An electron will not be able to avoid collisions with vibrating atoms;
consequently, it will be “scattered” from one atom to another. In the absence of an
applied field, the path of an electron may be visualized as illustrated in Figure 2.2a,
where scattering from lattice vibrations causes the electron to move randomly in
the lattice. On those occasions when the electron reaches a crystal surface, it
becomes “deflected” (or “bounced”) back into the crystal. Therefore, in the absence
of a field, after some duration of time, the electron crosses its initial x plane position again. Over a long time, the electrons therefore show no net displacement in
any one direction.
When the conductor is connected to a battery and an electric field is applied
to the crystal, as shown in Figure 2.2b, the electron experiences an acceleration in
the x direction in addition to its random motion, so after some time, it will drift a
finite distance in the x direction. The electron accelerates along the x direction under
the action of the force eEx, and then it suddenly collides with a vibrating atom and
loses the gained velocity. Therefore, there is an average velocity in the x direction,
which, if calculated, determines the current via Equation 2.2. Note that since the
electron experiences an acceleration in the x direction, its trajectory between collisions is a parabola, like the trajectory of a golf ball experiencing acceleration due
to gravity.
To calculate the drift velocity vdx of the electrons due to applied field Ex, we
first consider the velocity vxi of the ith electron in the x direction at time t. Suppose

its last collision was at time ti; therefore, for time (t − ti), it accelerated free of collisions, as indicated in Figure 2.3. Let uxi be the velocity of electron i in the x direction
just after the collision. We will call this the initial velocity. Since eEx∕me is the
acceleration of the electron, the velocity vxi in the x direction at time t will be
vxi = uxi +

eEx
(t − ti )
me

However, this is only for the ith electron. We need the average velocity vdx for
all such electrons along x. We average the expression for i = 1 to N electrons, as in
Equation 2.1. We assume that immediately after a collision with a vibrating ion, the
electron may move in any random direction; that is, it can just as likely move along
the negative or positive x, so that uxi averaged over many electrons is zero. Thus,
vdx =

where (t − ti ) is the average free time for N electrons between collisions.
Suppose that τ is the mean free time, or the mean time between collisions (also
known as the mean scattering time). For some electrons, (t − ti) will be greater
than τ, and for others, it will be shorter, as shown in Figure 2.3. Averaging (t − ti)
for N electrons will be the same as τ. Thus, we can substitute τ for (t − ti ) in the
previous expression to obtain

130

CHAPTER 2

∙

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

to the microscopic processes that cause the scattering of the electrons in the metal;
that is, lattice vibrations, crystal imperfections, and impurities, to name a few.
From the expression for the drift velocity vdx, the current density Jx follows
immediately by substituting Equation 2.4 into 2.2, that is,
Ohm’s law

Jx = enμdEx

[2.6]

Therefore, the current density is proportional to the electric field and the conductivity σ is the term multiplying Ex, that is,
Unipolar
conductivity

σ = enμd

[2.7]

It is gratifying that by treating the electron as a particle and applying classical
mechanics (F = ma), we are able to derive Ohm’s law. We should note, however,
that we assumed τ to be independent of the field.
Drift mobility is important because it is a widely used electronic parameter in
semiconductor device physics. The drift mobility gauges how fast electrons will drift
when driven by an applied field. If the electron is not highly scattered, then the mean
free time between collisions will be long, τ will be large, and by Equation 2.5, the
drift mobility will also be large; the electrons will therefore be highly mobile and
be able to “respond” to the field. However, a large drift mobility does not necessarily
imply high conductivity, because σ also depends on the concentration of conduction
electrons n.
The mean time between collisions τ has further significance. Its reciprocal 1∕τ
represents the mean frequency of collisions or scattering events; that is, 1∕τ is the
mean probability per unit time that the electron will be scattered (see Example 2.1).
Therefore, during a small time interval δt, the probability of scattering will be δt∕τ.
The probability of scattering per unit time 1∕τ is time independent and depends only
on the nature of the electron scattering mechanism.
There is one important assumption in the derivation of the drift velocity vdx
in Equation 2.3. We obtained vdx by averaging the velocities vxi of N electrons
along x at one instant, as defined in Equation 2.1. The drift velocity therefore
represents the average velocity of all the electrons along x at one instant; that is,
vdx is a number average at one instant. Figure 2.2b shows that after many collisions,
after a time interval Δt ≫ τ, an electron would have been displaced by a net distance
Δx along x. The term Δx∕Δt represents the effective velocity with which the
electron drifts along x. It is an average velocity for one electron over many collisions, that is, over a long time (hence, Δt ≫ τ), so Δx∕Δt is a time average.
Provided that Δt contains many collisions, it is reasonable to expect that the drift
velocity Δx∕Δt from the time average for one electron is the same as the drift
velocity vdx per electron from averaging for all electrons at one instant, as in
Equation 2.1, or
Drift velocity

Δx
= vdx
Δt

The two velocities are the same only under steady-state conditions (Δt ≫ τ).
Example 2.4 derives vdx for one electron and shows that it is the same as Equation 2.3.

PROBABILITY OF SCATTERING PER UNIT TIME AND THE MEAN FREE TIME If 1∕τ is
defined as the mean probability per unit time that an electron is scattered, show that the mean
time between collisions is τ.

131

EXAMPLE 2.1

SOLUTION

Consider an infinitesimally small time interval dt at time t. Let N be the number of unscattered
electrons at time t. The probability of scattering during dt is (1∕τ) dt, and the number of
scattered electrons during dt is N(1∕τ) dt. The change dN in N is thus
1
dN = −N( )dt
τ

The negative sign indicates a reduction in N because, as electrons become scattered,
N decreases. Integrating this equation, we can find N at any time t, given that at time t = 0,
N0 is the total number of unscattered electrons. Therefore,
t
N = N0 exp(−

This equation represents the number of unscattered electrons at time t. It reflects an
exponential decay law for the number of unscattered electrons. The above equation is called
the probability distribution function for unscattered electrons in time. It is a probability distribution for free times.
The mean free time t can be calculated from the mathematical definition of t,

where we have used N = N0exp(−t∕τ). Clearly, 1∕τ is the mean probability of scattering

It is left as an exercise to show that the exponential probability distribution of free times
above can also be used to calculate the mean square time t2 , which is 2τ2.

63.5 g mol−1. If the mean speed of the conduction electrons in Cu is roughly 1.6 × 106 m s−1,
what is the mean free path between collisions?

We can calculate μd from σ = enμd because we already know the conductivity σ. The number
of free electrons n per unit volume can be taken as equal to the number of Cu atoms per unit
volume, if we assume that each Cu atom donates one electron to the conduction electron gas

From the drift mobility we can calculate the mean free time τ between collisions by
using Equation 2.5,

The mean speed u of the conduction electrons is about 1.6 × 106 m s−1, so that their
mean free path ℓ = uτ = 39 nm.

EXAMPLE 2.3

DRIFT VELOCITY AND MEAN SPEED What is the applied electric field that will impose a drift

velocity equal to 0.1 percent of the mean speed u (∼106 m s−1) of conduction electrons in copper?
What is the corresponding current density and current through a Cu wire of diameter 1 mm?

SOLUTION

The drift velocity of the conduction electrons is vdx = μdEx, where μd is the drift mobility, which
for copper is 43.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (see Example 2.2). With vdx = 0.001u = 103 m s−1, we have
Ex =

μd

or

2.3 kV cm −1

This is an unattainably large electric field in a metal. Given the conductivity σ of copper, the
equivalent current density is
Jx = σEx = (5.9 × 107 Ω −1 m −1 ) (2.3 × 105 V m −1 )
= 1.4 × 1013 A m −2

or

1.4 × 107 A mm −2

This means a current of 1.1 × 107 A through a 1 mm diameter wire! It is clear from this
example that for all practical purposes, even under the highest working currents and voltages,
the drift velocity is much smaller than the mean speed of the electrons. Consequently, when an
electric field is applied to a conductor, for all practical purposes, the mean speed is unaffected.

DRIFT VELOCITY IN A FIELD: A CLOSER LOOK There is another way to explain the
observed dependence of the drift velocity on the field, and Equation 2.3. Consider the path
of a conduction electron in an applied field Ex as shown in Figure 2.4. Suppose that at time
t = 0 the electron has just been scattered from a lattice vibration. Let ux1 be the initial velocity in the x direction just after this initial collision (to which we assign a collision number of
zero). We will assume that immediately after a collision, the velocity of the electron is in a
random direction. Suppose that the first collision occurs at time t1. Since eEx∕me is the acceleration, the distance s1 covered in the x direction during the free time t1 will be
1 eEx
s1 = ux1t1 + ( )t21
2 me

At time t1, the electron collides with a lattice vibration (its first collision), and the velocity is randomized again to become ux2. The whole process is then repeated during the next

interval which lasts for a free time t2, and the electron traverses a distance s2 along x, and so
on. To find the overall distance traversed by the electron after p such scattering events, we
sum all the above distances s1, s2, . . . for p free time intervals,

s = s1 + s2 + … + sp = [ux1t1 + ux2t2 + … + uxptp ] + ( ) [t21 + t21 + … + t2p ]

[2.8]

Since after a collision the “initial” velocity ux is always random, the first term has ux
values that are randomly negative and positive, so for many collisions (large p) the first term
on the right-hand side of Equation 2.8 is nearly zero and can certainly be neglected compared
with the second term. Thus, after many collisions, the net distance s = Δx traversed in the
x direction is given by the second term in Equation 2.8, which is the electric field induced
displacement term. If t2 is the mean square free time, then

Suppose that τ is the mean free time between collisions, where τ = (t1 + t2 + ⋯ + tp)∕p.
We know from Example 2.1 that the probability that the electron will not be scattered, that
is it is still free, decreases exponentially with time in which the mean free time t is τ. Using
the same probability distribution function, we easily can show that t2 = 2(t) 2 = 2τ2 . So in

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

This is the same expression as Equation 2.3, except that τ is defined here as the average
free time for a single electron over a long time, that is, over many collisions, whereas previously it was the mean free time averaged over many electrons. Further, in Equation 2.9 vdx
is an average drift for an electron over a long time, over many collisions. In Equation 2.1 vdx
is the average velocity averaged over all electrons at one instant. For all practical purposes,
the two are equivalent. (The equivalence breaks down when we are interested in events over
a time scale that is comparable to one scattering, ∼10−14 second.)
The drift mobility μd from Equation 2.9 is identical to that of Equation 2.5, μd = eτ∕me.
Suppose that the mean speed of the electrons (not the drift velocity) is u. Then an electron
moves a distance ℓ = uτ in mean free time τ, which is called the mean free path. The drift
mobility and conductivity become,
μd =

eℓ

and

σ = en μd =

e2nℓ

[2.10]

Equations 2.3 and 2.10 both assume that after each collision the velocity is randomized.
The scattering process, lattice scattering, is able to randomize the velocity in one single scattering. In general not all electron scattering processes can randomize the velocity in one scattering process. If it takes more than one collision to randomize the velocity, then the electron
is able to carry with it some velocity gained from a previous collision and hence possesses
a higher drift mobility. In such cases one needs to consider the effective mean free path a
carrier has to move to eventually randomize the velocity gained; this is a point considered in
Chapter 4 when we calculate the resistivity at low temperatures.

2.2

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF RESISTIVITY:
IDEAL PURE METALS

When the conduction electrons are only scattered by thermal vibrations of the metal
ions, then τ in the mobility expression μd = eτ∕me refers to the mean time between
scattering events by this process. The resulting conductivity and resistivity are
denoted by σT and ρT, where the subscript T represents “thermal vibration scattering.”
To find the temperature dependence of σ, we first consider the temperature
dependence of the mean free time τ, since this determines the drift mobility. An
electron moving with a mean speed u is scattered when its path crosses the crosssectional area S of a scattering center, as depicted in Figure 2.5. The scattering
S = πa2

center may be a vibrating atom, impurity, vacancy, or some other crystal defect. Since
τ is the mean time taken for one scattering process, the mean free path ℓ of the
electron between scattering processes is uτ. If Ns is the concentration of scattering
centers, then in the volume Sℓ, there is one scattering center, that is, (Suτ)Ns = 1.
Thus, the mean free time is given by
τ=

SuNs

[2.11]

The mean speed u of conduction electrons in a metal can be shown to be only
slightly temperature dependent.4 In fact, electrons wander randomly around in the
metal crystal with an almost constant mean speed that depends largely on their concentration and hence on the crystal material. Taking the number of scattering centers
per unit volume to be the atomic concentration, the temperature dependence of τ
then arises essentially from that of the cross-sectional area S. Consider what a free
electron “sees” as it approaches a vibrating crystal atom as in Figure 2.5. Because
the atomic vibrations are random, the atom covers a cross-sectional area πa2, where
a is the amplitude of the vibrations. If the electron’s path crosses πa2, it gets scattered. Therefore, the mean time between scattering events τ is inversely proportional
to the area πa2 that scatters the electron, that is, τ ∝ 1∕πa2.
The thermal vibrations of the atom can be considered to be simple harmonic
motion, much the same way as that of a mass M attached to a spring. The average
kinetic energy of the oscillations is 14 Ma2ω2 , where ω is the oscillation frequency.
From the kinetic theory of matter, this average kinetic energy must be on the order
of 12 kT . Therefore,
1 2 2 1

so a2 ∝ T. Intuitively, this is correct because raising the temperature increases the
amplitude of the atomic vibrations. Thus,

The fact that the mean speed of electrons in a metal is only weakly temperature dependent can be proved
from what it called the Fermi–Dirac statistics for the collection of electrons in a metal (as in Chapter 4). This
result contrasts sharply with the kinetic molecular theory of gases (Chapter 1), which predicts that the mean
speed of molecules is proportional to √T . For the time being, we simply use a constant mean speed u for the
conduction electrons in a metal.

where A is a temperature-independent constant. This shows that the resistivity of a
pure metal wire increases linearly with the temperature, and that the resistivity is
due simply to the scattering of conduction electrons by the thermal vibrations of the
atoms. We term this conductivity lattice-scattering-limited conductivity.5

EXAMPLE 2.6

DRIFT MOBILITY AND RESISTIVITY DUE TO LATTICE VIBRATIONS Given that the mean
speed of conduction electrons in copper is 1.6 × 106 m s−1 and the frequency of vibration of
the copper atoms at room temperature is about 4 × 1012 s−1, estimate the drift mobility of
electrons and the conductivity of copper. The density d of copper is 8.96 g cm−3 and the
atomic mass Mat is 63.56 g mol−1.
SOLUTION

The method for calculating the drift mobility and hence the conductivity is based on evaluating the mean free time τ via Equation 2.11, that is, τ = 1∕SuNs. Since τ is due to scattering
from atomic vibrations, Ns is the atomic concentration,
Ns =

dNA (8.96 × 103 kg m−3 ) (6.02 × 1023 mol−1 )

63.56 × 10−3 kg mol−1

The cross-sectional area S = πa2 depends on the amplitude a of the thermal vibrations
as shown in Figure 2.5. The average kinetic energy KEav associated with a vibrating mass M
attached to a spring is given by KEav = 41 Ma2ω2 , where ω is the angular frequency of the
vibration (ω = 2π4 × 1012 rad s−1). Applying this equation to the vibrating atom and equating the average kinetic energy KEav to 12 kT , by virtue of equipartition of energy theorem, we
have a2 = 2kT∕Mω2 and thus

As will be apparent in Chapter 4, the actual explanation in the modern theory of solids is based on the concept
of “phonons,” quanta of lattice waves in the crystal, and how their concentration depends on the temperature.

= 4.5 × 105 Ω−1 cm−1

The experimentally measured value for the conductivity is 5.9 × 105 Ω−1 cm−1, so our
crude calculation based on Equation 2.11 is actually only 24 percent lower, which is not bad
for a crude estimate. (As one might have surmised, the agreement is brought about by using
reasonable values for the mean speed u and the atomic vibrational frequency ω. These values
were taken from quantum mechanical calculations, so our evaluation for τ was not truly based
on classical concepts.)

2.3

MATTHIESSEN’S AND NORDHEIM’S RULES

2.3.1 MATTHIESSEN’S RULE AND THE TEMPERATURE

COEFFICIENT OF RESISTIVITY (α)
The theory of conduction that considers scattering from lattice vibrations only works
well with pure metals; unfortunately, it fails for metallic alloys. Their resistivities are
only weakly temperature dependent. We must therefore search for a different type of
scattering mechanism.
Consider a metal alloy that has randomly distributed impurity atoms. An electron
can now be scattered by the impurity atoms because they are not identical to the
host atoms, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. The impurity atom need not be larger than
the host atom; it can be smaller. As long as the impurity atom results in a local
distortion of the crystal lattice, it will be effective in scattering. One way of looking
at the scattering process from an impurity is to consider the scattering cross section.
What actually scatters the electron is a local, unexpected change in the potential
energy PE of the electron as it approaches the impurity, because the force experienced by the electron is given by
F=−

d(PE)
dx

For example, when an impurity atom of a different size compared to the host atom
is placed into the crystal lattice, the impurity atom distorts the region around it,
either by pushing the host atoms farther away, or by pulling them in, as depicted in
Figure 2.6. The cross section that scatters the electron is the lattice region that has

been elastically distorted by the impurity (the impurity atom itself and its neighboring host atoms), so that in this zone, the electron suddenly experiences a force
F = −d(PE)∕dx due to a sudden change in the PE. This region has a large scattering
cross section, since the distortion induced by the impurity may extend a number of
atomic distances. These impurity atoms will therefore hinder the motion of the electrons, thereby increasing the resistance.
We now effectively have two types of mean free times between collisions: one,
τT, for scattering from thermal vibrations only, and the other, τI, for scattering from
impurities only. We define τT as the mean time between scattering events arising
from thermal vibrations alone and τI as the mean time between scattering events
arising from collisions with impurities alone. Both are illustrated in Figure 2.6.
In general, an electron may be scattered by both processes, so the effective mean
free time τ between any two scattering events will be less than the individual scattering times τT and τI. The electron will therefore be scattered when it collides with
either an atomic vibration or an impurity atom. Since in unit time, 1∕τ is the net
probability of scattering, 1∕τT is the probability of scattering from lattice vibrations
alone, and 1∕τI is the probability of scattering from impurities alone, then within the
realm of elementary probability theory for independent events, we have

[2.13]

In writing Equation 2.13 for the various probabilities, we make the reasonable
assumption that, to a greater extent, the two scattering mechanisms are essentially
independent. Here, the effective mean scattering time τ is clearly smaller than both
τT and τI. We can also interpret Equation 2.13 as follows: In unit time, the overall
number of collisions (1∕τ) is the sum of the number of collisions with thermal vibrations alone (1∕τT) and the number of collisions with impurities alone (1∕τI).
The drift mobility μd depends on the effective scattering time τ via μd = eτ∕me,
so Equation 2.13 can also be written in terms of the drift mobilities determined by

where μL is the lattice-scattering-limited drift mobility, and μI is the impurityscattering-limited drift mobility. By definition, μL = eτT∕me and μI = eτI∕me. The

which can be written

where 1∕enμL is defined as the resistivity due to scattering from thermal vibrations,
and 1∕enμI is the resistivity due to scattering from impurities, or
ρT =

1
enμL

and

ρI =

1
enμI

The final result in Equation 2.15 simply states that the effective resistivity ρ is
the sum of two contributions. First, ρT = 1∕enμL is the resistivity due to scattering
by thermal vibrations of the host atoms. For those near-perfect pure metal crystals,
this is the dominating contribution. As soon as we add impurities, however, there is
an additional resistivity, ρI = 1∕enμI, which arises from the scattering of the electrons from the impurities. The first term is temperature dependent because τT ∝ T −1
(see Section 2.2), but the second term is not.
The mean time τI between scattering events involving electron collisions with
impurity atoms depends on the separation between the impurity atoms and therefore
on the concentration of those atoms (see Figure 2.6). If ℓI is the mean separation
between the impurities, then the mean free time between collisions with impurities
alone will be ℓI∕u, which is temperature independent because ℓI is determined by
the impurity concentration NI (i.e., ℓI = NI−1∕3), and the mean speed u of the electrons
is nearly constant in a metal. In the absence of impurities, τI is infinitely long, and
thus ρI = 0. The summation rule of resistivities from different scattering mechanisms,
as shown by Equation 2.15, is called Matthiessen’s rule.6
There may also be electrons scattering from dislocations and other crystal
defects, as well as from grain boundaries. All of these scattering processes add to
the resistivity of a metal, just as the scattering process from impurities. We can
therefore write the effective resistivity of a metal as
ρ = ρT + ρR

[2.16]

6
The summation rule of resistivities in Equations 2.15 or 2.16 was discovered by Augustus Matthiessens
(1831–1870), and reported in his experimental papers on the conductivity of metals and their alloys, published
mainly in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, around 1857–1864. At the time it was
not, of course, known as Matthiessen’s rule and the rule itself is actually a modern conceptualization of his
observations long after his papers. Matthiessen received the Royal Medal from the Royal Society in 1869
for his research on metals and alloys. There is an excellent discussion of Matthiessen’s works by Simon
Reif-Acherman in the Proc. IEEE, 103, 713, 2015.

where ρR is called the residual resistivity and is due to the scattering of electrons

means that ρR also includes ρI). The residual resistivity shows very little temperature
dependence, whereas ρT = AT, so the effective resistivity ρ is given by

Definition of

[2.17]

where A and B are temperature-independent constants.
Equation 2.17 indicates that the resistivity of a metal varies almost linearly with
the temperature, with A and B depending on the material. Instead of listing A and B
in resistivity tables, we prefer to use a temperature coefficient that refers to small,
normalized changes around a reference temperature. The temperature coefficient
of resistivity (TCR) α0 is defined as the fractional change in the resistivity per unit
temperature increase at the reference temperature T0, that is,
α0 =

1 δρ
ρ0 [ δT ]T=T0

[2.18]

where ρ0 is the resistivity at the reference temperature T0, usually 273 K (0 °C) or
293 K (20 °C), and δρ = ρ − ρ0 is the change in the resistivity due to a small increase
in temperature, δT = T − T0.
When the resistivity follows the behavior ρ ≈ AT + B in Equation 2.17, then
according to Equation 2.18, α0 is constant over a temperature range T0 to T, and
Equation 2.18 leads to the well-known equation,
ρ = ρ0[1 + α0(T − T0)]

[2.19]

Equation 2.19 is actually only valid when α0 is constant over the temperature
range of interest, which requires Equation 2.17 to hold. Over a limited temperature
range, this will usually be the case. Although it is not obvious from Equation 2.19,
we should note that α0 depends on the reference temperature T0, by virtue of ρ0
depending on T0.
The equation ρ = AT, which we used for pure-metal crystals to find the change
in the resistance with temperature, is only approximate; nonetheless, for pure metals,
it is useful to recall in the absence of tabulated data. To determine how good the
formula ρ = AT is, put it in Equation 2.19, which leads to α0 = T 0−1. If we take the
reference temperature T0 as 273 K (0 °C), then α0 is simply 1∕273 K; stated differently, Equation 2.19 is then equivalent to ρ = AT.
Table 2.1 shows that ρ ∝ T is not a bad approximation for some of the familiar
pure metals used as conductors (Cu, Al, Au, etc.), but it fails badly for others, in
particular, the magnetic metals such as iron and nickel.
The temperature dependence of the resistivity of various metals is shown in
Figure 2.7, where it is apparent that except for the magnetic materials, the linear
relationship ρ ∝ T seems to be approximately obeyed almost all the way to the
melting temperature for many pure metals. It should also be noted that for
the alloys, such as nichrome (Ni–Cr), the resistivity is essentially dominated by the
residual resistivity, so the resistivity is relatively temperature insensitive, with a very
small TCR.

example, the conduction electron is not scattered simply by atomic vibrations, as in

leads to a complicated temperature dependence.
Although our oversimplified theoretical analysis predicts a linear ρ = AT + B
behavior for the resistivity down to the lowest temperatures, this is not true in reality, as depicted for copper in Figure 2.8. As the temperature decreases, typically
below ∼100 K for many metals, our simple and gross assumption that all the atoms
are vibrating with a constant frequency fails. Indeed, the number of atoms that are
vibrating with sufficient energy to scatter the conduction electrons starts to decrease
rapidly with decreasing temperature, so the resistivity due to scattering from thermal vibrations becomes more strongly temperature dependent. The mean free time
τ = 1∕SuNs becomes longer and strongly temperature dependent, leading to a smaller
resistivity than the ρ ∝ T behavior. A full theoretical analysis, which is beyond
the scope of this chapter, shows that ρ ∝ T 5. Thus, at the lowest temperature, from

melting temperature, 1358 K) on a log-log plot.
Above about 100 K, ρ ∝ T, whereas at low temperatures, ρ ∝ T 5, and at the lowest
temperatures ρ approaches the residual resistivity ρR. The inset shows the ρ versus
T behavior below 100 K on a linear plot. ( ρR is too small on this scale.)

Matthiessen’s rule, the resistivity becomes ρ = DT 5 + ρR, where D is a constant. Since
the slope of ρ versus T is dρ∕dT = 5DT 4, which tends to zero as T becomes small,
we have ρ curving toward ρR as T decreases toward 0 K. This is borne out by
experiments, as shown in Figure 2.8 for copper. Therefore, at the lowest temperatures
of interest, the resistivity is limited by scattering from impurities and crystal defects.7
MATTHIESSEN’S RULE Explain the typical resistivity versus temperature behavior of annealed

and cold-worked (deformed) copper containing various amounts of Ni as shown in Figure 2.9.

SOLUTION

When small amounts of nickel are added to copper, the resistivity increases by virtue of
Matthiessen’s rule, ρ = ρT + ρR + ρI, where ρT is the resistivity due to scattering from thermal
vibrations; ρR is the residual resistivity of the copper crystal due to scattering from crystal
defects, dislocations, trace impurities, etc.; and ρI is the resistivity arising from Ni addition
7

At sufficiently low temperatures (typically, below 10–20 K for many metals and below ∼135 K for certain ceramics)
certain materials exhibit superconductivity in which the resistivity vanishes ( ρ = 0), even in the presence of
impurities and crystal defects. Superconductivity and its quantum mechanical origin will be explained in Chapter 8.

alone (scattering from Ni impurity regions). Since ρI is temperature independent, for small
amounts of Ni addition, ρI will simply shift up the ρ versus T curve for copper, by an amount
proportional to the Ni content, ρI ∝ NNi, where NNi is the Ni impurity concentration. This is
apparent in Figure 2.9, where the resistivity of Cu–2.16% Ni is almost twice that of Cu–1.12%
Ni. Cold working (CW) or deforming a metal results in a higher concentration of dislocations
and therefore increases the residual resistivity ρR by ρCW. Thus, cold-worked samples have a
resistivity curve that is shifted up by an additional amount ρCW that depends on the extent of
cold working.

α0 =

It is clear that, in general, α0 depends on the temperature T, as well as on the reference

reasonably well with α293 K = 0.0044 K−1, frequently found in data books.
For Cu, α293 K = 0.00393 K−1, so that n = 1.15, which is very close to the value of 1.16
in Table 2.1.
TCR AT DIFFERENT REFERENCE TEMPERATURES If α1 is the temperature coefficient of
resistivity (TCR) at temperature T1 and α0 is the TCR at T0, show that

SOLUTION

Consider the resistivity at temperature T in terms of α0 and α1:
ρ = ρ0[1 + α0(T − T0)]

and

ρ = ρ1[1 + α1(T − T1)]

These equations are expected to hold at any temperature T, so the first and second equations at T1 and T0, respectively, give
ρ1 = ρ0[1 + α0(T1 − T0)]

and

ρ0 = ρ1[1 + α1(T0 − T1)]

These two equations can be readily solved to eliminate ρ0 and ρ1 to obtain
α1 =

α0
1 + α0 (T1 − T0 )

2.3.2 SOLID SOLUTIONS AND NORDHEIM’S RULE
In an isomorphous alloy of two metals, that is, a binary alloy that forms a solid
solution, we would expect Equation 2.15 to apply, with the temperature-independent
impurity contribution ρI increasing with the concentration of solute atoms. This
means that as the alloy concentration increases, the resistivity ρ increases and
becomes less temperature dependent as ρI overwhelms ρT, leading to α ≪ 1∕273.
This is the advantage of alloys in resistive components. Table 2.2 shows that when
80% nickel is alloyed with 20% chromium, the resistivity of Ni increases almost
16 times, and there is a corresponding drop in α. In fact, the alloy is called nichrome
and is widely used as a heater wire in household appliances and industrial furnaces.

Nordheim’s
rule for solid
solutions

As a further example of the resistivity of a solid solution, consider the copper–
nickel alloy. The phase diagram for this alloy system is shown in Figure 2.10a. It is
clear that the alloy forms a one-phase solid solution for all compositions. Both Cu
and Ni have the same FCC crystal structure, and since the Cu atom is only slightly
larger than the Ni atom by about ∼3 percent (easily checked on the Periodic Table),
the Cu–Ni alloy will therefore still be FCC, but with Cu and Ni atoms randomly
mixed, resulting in a solid solution. When Ni is added to copper, the impurity resistivity ρI in Equation 2.15 will increase with the Ni concentration. Experimental
results for this alloy system are shown in Figure 2.10b. It should be apparent that
when we reach 100% Ni, we again have a pure metal whose resistivity must be small.
Therefore, ρ versus Ni concentration must pass through a maximum, which for the
Cu–Ni alloy seems to be at around ∼50% Ni.
There are other binary solid solutions that reflect similar behavior to that depicted
in Figure 2.10, such as Cu–Au, Ag–Au, Pt–Pd, Cu–Pd, to name a few. Quite often,
the use of an alloy for a particular application is necessitated by the mechanical
properties, rather than the desired electrical resistivity alone. For example, brass,
which is 70% Cu–30% Zn in solid solution, has a higher strength compared to pure
copper; as such, it is a suitable metal for the prongs of an electrical plug.
An important semiempirical equation that can be used to predict the resistivity
of an alloy is Nordheim’s rule which relates the impurity resistivity ρI to the atomic
fraction X of solute atoms in a solid solution, as follows:
ρI = CX(1 − X)

[2.21]

where C is the constant termed the Nordheim coefficient, which represents the
effectiveness of the solute atom in increasing the resistivity. Nordheim’s rule assumes

2.3

MATTHIESSEN’S AND NORDHEIM’S RULES

that the solid solution has the solute atoms randomly distributed in the lattice, and
these random distributions of impurities cause the electrons to become scattered
as they whiz around the crystal. For sufficiently small amounts of impurity, experiments show that the increase in the resistivity ρI is nearly always simply proportional
to the impurity concentration X, that is, ρI ∝ X, which explains the initial approximately equal increments of rise in the resistivity of copper with 1.12% Ni and 2.16%
Ni additions as shown in Figure 2.9. For dilute solutions, Nordheim’s rule predicts
the same linear behavior, that is, ρI = CX for X ≪ 1.
Table 2.3 lists some typical Nordheim coefficients for various additions to copper and gold. The value of the Nordheim coefficient depends on the type of solute
and the solvent. A solute atom that is drastically different in size to the solvent atom
will result in a bigger increase in ρI and will therefore lead to a larger C. An important assumption in Nordheim’s rule in Equation 2.21 is that the alloying does not
significantly vary the number of conduction electrons per atom in the alloy. Although
this will be true for alloys with the same valency, that is, from the same column in
the Periodic Table (e.g., Cu–Au, Ag–Au), it will not be true for alloys of different
valency, such as Cu and Zn. In pure copper, there is just one conduction electron
per atom, whereas each Zn atom can donate two conduction electrons. As the Zn
content in brass is increased, more conduction electrons become available per atom.
Consequently, the resistivity predicted by Equation 2.21 at high Zn contents is greater
than the actual value because C refers to dilute alloys. To get the correct resistivity
from Equation 2.21 we have to lower C, which is equivalent to using an effective
Nordheim coefficient Ceff that decreases as the Zn content increases. In other cases,
for example, in Cu–Ni alloys, we have to increase C at high Ni concentrations to
account for additional electron scattering mechanisms that develop with Ni addition.

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

Nonetheless, the Nordheim rule is still a very useful tool for predicting the resistivities of dilute alloys, particularly in the low-concentration region.
With Nordheim’s rule in Equation 2.21, the resistivity of an alloy of composition
X is
ρ = ρmatrix + CX (1 − X)
[2.22]
where ρmatrix = ρT + ρR is the resistivity of the matrix due to scattering from thermal
vibrations and from other defects, in the absence of alloying elements. To reiterate,
the value of C depends on the alloying element and the matrix. For example, C for
gold in copper would be different than C for copper in gold, as shown in Table 2.3.
In solid solutions, at some concentrations of certain binary alloys, such as 75%
Cu–25% Au and 50% Cu–50% Au, the annealed solid has an orderly structure; that is,
the Cu and Au atoms are not randomly mixed, but occupy regular sites. In fact, these
compositions can be viewed as pure compounds—like the solids Cu3Au and CuAu.
The resistivities of Cu3Au and CuAu will therefore be less than the same composition
random alloy that has been quenched from the melt. As a consequence, the resistivity
ρ versus composition X curve does not follow the dashed parabolic curve throughout;
rather, it exhibits sharp falls at these special compositions, as illustrated in Figure 2.11.
Figure 2.11 Electrical resistivity versus
composition at room temperature in Cu–Au alloys.
The quenched sample (dashed curve) is obtained
by quenching the liquid, and the Cu and Au
atoms are randomly mixed. The resistivity obeys
the Nordheim rule. When the quenched sample
is annealed or the liquid is slowly cooled (solid
curve), certain compositions (Cu3Au and CuAu)
result in an ordered crystalline structure in
which the Cu and Au atoms are positioned in an
ordered fashion in the crystal and the scattering
effect is reduced.

Lothar Nordheim (1923–1985) was a German physicist who obtained his
PhD from University of Göttingen. He immigrated to the USA in 1934, and
later became a physics professor at Duke University. The Nordheim rule
in this chapter for the increase in the resistivity of a solid solution with
added solute atoms is based on his theoretical work published in Annalen
der Physik in 1931. His name will come up again in Chapter 4 under the
Fowler–Nordheim tunneling current at high electric fields.

2.3

MATTHIESSEN’S AND NORDHEIM’S RULES

NORDHEIM’S RULE The alloy 90 wt.% Au–10 wt.% Cu is sometimes used in low-voltage
dc electrical contacts, because pure gold is mechanically soft and the addition of copper
increases the hardness of the metal without sacrificing the corrosion resistance. Predict the
resistivity of the alloy and compare it with the experimental value of 108 nΩ m.

149

EXAMPLE 2.10

SOLUTION

We apply Equation 2.22, ρ(X) = ρAu + CX(1 − X) but with 10 wt.% Cu converted to the
atomic fraction for X. If w is the weight fraction of Cu, w = 0.1, and if MAu and MCu are the
atomic masses of Au and Cu, then the atomic fraction X of Cu is given by (see Example 1.2),
X=

w∕MCu
0.1∕63.55
=
= 0.256
w∕MCu + (1 − w)∕MAu (0.1∕63.55) + (0.90∕197)

Given that ρAu = 22.8 nΩ m and C = 450 nΩ m,
ρ = ρAu + CX(1 − X) = (22.8 nΩ m) + (450 nΩ m)(0.256)(1 − 0.256)
= 108.5 nΩ m

This value is only 0.5% different from the experimental value.

RESISTIVITY DUE TO IMPURITIES

The mean speed of conduction electrons in copper is
about 1.6 × 106 m s−1. Its room temperature resistivity is 17 nΩ m, and the atomic concentration Nat in the crystal is 8.5 × 1022 cm−3. Suppose that we add 1 at.% Au to form a solid
solution. What is the resistivity of the alloy, the effective mean free path, and the mean free
path due to collisions with Au atoms only?

EXAMPLE 2.11

SOLUTION

According to Table 2.3, the Nordheim coefficient C of Au in Cu is 5500 nΩ m. With X = 0.01
(1 at.%), the overall resistivity from Equation 2.22 is
ρ = ρmatrix + CX(1 − X) = 17 nΩ m + (5500 nΩ m)(0.01)(1 − 0.01)
= 17 nΩ m + 54.45 nΩ m = 71.45 nΩ m

Suppose that ℓ is the overall or effective mean free path and τ is the effective mean free time
between scattering events (includes both scattering from lattice vibrations and impurities). Since
ℓ = uτ, and the effective drift mobility μd = eτ∕me, the expression for the conductivity becomes
σ = enμd =

e2nτ e2nℓ
=
me
meu

We can now calculate the effective mean free path ℓ in the alloy given that copper has a
valency of 1 and the electron concentration n = Nat,

=
−9
71.5 × 10 Ω m (9.1 × 10 −31 kg) (1.6 × 106 m s −1 )

which gives ℓ = 9.4 nm. We can repeat the calculation for pure copper using σ = 1∕ρmatrix =
1∕(17 × 10−9 Ω m) to find ℓCu = 39 nm. The mean free path is reduced approximately by
4 times by adding only 1 at.% Au. The mean free path ℓI due to scattering from impurities
only can be found from Equation 2.13 multiplied through by 1∕u, or by using Matthiessen’s

CHAPTER 2

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

Substituting ℓCu = 39 nm and ℓ = 9.4 nm, we find ℓI = 12.4 nm.
We can take these calculations one step further. If NI is the impurity concentration in
the alloy, then NI = 0.01Nat = 0.01(8.5 × 1028 m−3) = 8.5 × 1026 m−3. The mean separation
dI between the impurities can be estimated roughly from dI ≈ 1∕NI1∕3, which gives dI ≈ 1.0 nm.
It is clear that not all Au atoms can be involved in scattering the electrons since ℓI is much
longer than dI. (Another way to look at it is to say that it takes more than just one collision
with an impurity to randomize the velocity of the electron.)
EXAMPLE 2.12

ALLOYS AND TCR Using the resistivities of Ni and nichrome, the TCR of Ni in Table 2.2,
and the combined Mathiessens and Nordheim rules, find the TCR of nichrome.
SOLUTION

For an alloy AB in which A is the solvent (matrix) and B is the solute (added atoms), Equation 2.22 is
ρAB = ρA + CX(1 − X)

TCR describes the change in ρ due to a change in T, so we differentiate the above equation
with respect to T and assume that C is temperature independent
dρAB dρA

so that the TCR of AB is
αAB =

(1100 nΩ m)

which is what is shown in Table 2.2 for nichrome. Equation 2.23 brings home the distinct
advantage of alloys. Their TCR is much lower than the solvent metal.
EXAMPLE 2.13

DESIGN OF STRAIN GAUGES A strain gauge is a transducer attached to a body to measure
its fractional elongation ΔL∕L, or the strain, under an applied load (force) F. The gauge is a
grid of many folded runs of a thin, resistive wire glued to (or embedded in) a flexible backing, as depicted in Figure 2.12. (See also photo on page 211.) The gauge is bonded to the
body under test such that the resistive wire length is parallel to the strain. Suppose that the
strain does not change the resistivity ρ,8 then the resistance R of the gauge wire is
R=

ρL
π(D∕2) 2

[2.24]

For most metals, this is a good assumption but not for semiconductors in which there is a change in the
resistivity with strain as explained in Chapter 5. By the way, both gage and gauge are used though many
electrical engineers use gage with strain gages.

where L and D are the length and diameter of the wire, respectively. The applied load changes

δR = (

For many metals, ν ≈ 1∕3, so that typically GF is roughly 1.67.
A major problem with strain gauges is that the change in R can be due to a change δT
in temperature rather than strain ε. A change δT would increase L, D, and ρ. We can differentiate R with respect to T by considering that ρ, L, and D depend on T. If α is the temperature coefficient of resistivity and λ is the linear expansion coefficient, then differentiating
Equation 2.23
1 dR
( R ) dT = α − λ

[2.28]

Typically, λ ≈ 2 × 10−5 K−1, and for pure metals, from Table 2.1 that α ≈ 1∕273 K−1 or
3.6 × 10−3 K−1. A 1 °C fluctuation in the temperature will result in δR∕R = 3.6 × 10−3, which
is about the same as δR∕R from a strain of ε = 2 × 10−3 at a constant temperature. Clearly,
temperature fluctuations would not allow sensible strain measurements if we were to use a

pure metal wire. Metal strain gauges therefore use alloys such as nichrome or constantan in
which α is very small. Further, engineers use strain gauges in special resistance bridge configurations to further reduce the effects of temperature variations. (See Question 2.23.)
Even if we make α − λ = 0 in Equation 2.28, the temperature change still produces a
change in the resistance because the metal wire and specimen expand by different amounts
and this creates a strain and hence a change in the resistance. Suppose that λgauge and λspecimen
are the linear expansion coefficients of the gauge wire and the specimen, then the differential
expansion will be λspecimen − λgauge and this can only be zero if λgauge = λspecimen.

Nordheim’s rule only applies to solid solutions that are single-phase solids. In other
words, it is valid for homogeneous mixtures in which the atoms are mixed at the atomic
level throughout the solid, as in the Cu–Ni alloy. The classic problem of determining
the effective resistivity of a multiphase solid is closely related to the evaluation of the
effective dielectric constant, effective thermal conductivity, effective elastic modulus,
effective Poisson’s ratio, etc., for a variety of mixtures, including such composite
materials as fiberglass. Indeed, many of the mixture rules are identical.
Consider a material with two distinct phases α and β, which are stacked in layers as illustrated in Figure 2.13a. Let us evaluate the effective resistivity for current
flow in the x direction. Since the layers are in series, the effective resistance Reff for
the whole material is

where Lα is the total length (thickness) of the α-phase layers, and Lβ is the total
length of the β-phase layers, Lα + Lβ = L is the length of the sample, and A is the
cross-sectional area. Let χα and χβ be the volume fractions of the α and β phases.
The effective resistance is defined by
Reff =

Lρeff

where ρeff is the effective resistivity. Using χα = Lα∕L and χβ = Lβ∕L in Equation 2.29,
we find
ρeff = χα ρα + χβρβ

[2.30]

Resistivity–
mixture rule

which is called the resistivity–mixture rule (or the series rule of mixtures).
If we are interested in the effective resistivity in the y direction, as shown in
Figure 2.13b, obviously the α and β layers are in parallel, so an effective conductivity could be calculated in the same way as we did for the series case to find the
parallel rule of mixtures, that is,
σeff = χασα + χβσβ

[2.31]

Conductivity–
mixture rule

where σ is the electrical conductivity of those phases identified by the subscript.
Notice that the parallel rule uses the conductivity, and the series rule uses the resistivity. Equation 2.31 is often referred to as the conductivity–mixture rule.
Although these two rules refer to special cases, in general, for a random mixture
of phase α and phase β, we would not expect either equation to apply rigorously.
When the resistivities of two randomly mixed phases are not markedly different,
the series mixture rule can be applied at least approximately, as we will show in
Example 2.14.
However, if the resistivity of one phase is appreciably different than the other,
there are two semiempirical rules that are quite useful in materials engineering.9
Consider a heterogeneous material that has a dispersed phase (labeled d), in the form
of particles, in a continuous phase (labeled c) that acts as a matrix, as depicted in
Figure 2.13c. Assume that ρc and ρd are the resistivities of the continuous and dispersed phases, and χc and χd are their volume fractions. If the dispersed phase is
much more resistive with respect to the matrix, that is, ρd > 10ρc, then
ρeff = ρc

(1 − χd )

(ρd > 10ρc )

On the other hand, if ρd < (ρc∕10), then

Over the years, the task of predicting the resistivity of a mixture has challenged many theorists and
experimentalists, including Lord Rayleigh who, in 1892, published an excellent exposition on the subject in
the Philosophical Magazine. An extensive treatment of mixtures can be found in a paper by J. A. Reynolds and
J. M. Hough published in 1957 (Proceedings of the Physical Society (London), 70, 769), which contains most of
the mixture rules that are widely used today.

CHAPTER 2

∙

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

We therefore have at least four mixture rules at our disposal, the uses of which
depend on the mixture geometry and the resistivities of the various phases. The
problem is identifying which one to use for a given material, which in turn requires
a knowledge of the microstructure and properties of the constituents. It should be
emphasized that, at best, Equations 2.30 to 2.33 provide only a reasonable estimate
of the effective resistivity of the mixture.10
Equations 2.32 and 2.33 are simplified special cases of a more general mixture
rule due to Reynolds and Hough (1957). Consider a mixture that consists of a
continuous conducting phase with a conductivity σc that has dispersed spheres of
another phase of conductivity σd and of volume fraction χ, similar to Figure 2.13c.
The effective conductivity σeff of the mixture is given by
σeff − σc
σd − σc
=χ
σeff + 2σc
σd + 2σc

[2.34]

It is assumed that the spheres are randomly dispersed in the material. It is left
as an exercise to show that if σd ≪ σc, then Equation 2.34 reduces to Equation 2.32.
A good application would be the calculation of the effective resistivity of porous
carbon electrodes, which can be 50–100 percent more resistive than bulk polycrystalline carbon (graphite). If, on the other hand, σd ≫ σc, the dispersed phase is very
conducting, for example, silver particles mixed into a graphite paste to increase the
conductivity of the paste, then Equation 2.34 reduces to Equation 2.33. The usefulness of Equation 2.34 cannot be underestimated inasmuch as there are many types
of materials in engineering that are mixtures of one type or another.
THE RESISTIVITY-MIXTURE RULE Consider a two-phase alloy consisting of phase α and

phase β randomly mixed as shown in Figure 2.14a. The solid consists of a random mixture
of two types of resistivities, ρα of α and ρβ of β. We can divide the solid into a bundle of N
parallel fibers of length L and cross-sectional area A∕N, as shown in Figure 2.14b. In this
fiber (infinitesimally thin), the α and β phases are in series, so if χα = Vα∕V is the volume
fraction of phase α and χβ is that of β, then the total length of all α regions present in
the fiber is χαL, and the total length of β regions is χβ L. The two resistances are in series, so
the fiber resistance is
Rfiber =

ρα ( χαL) ρβ ( χβL)

(A∕N)
(A∕N)

But the resistance of the solid is made up of N such fibers in parallel, that is,
Rsolid =

By definition, Rsolid = ρeff L∕A, where ρeff is the effective resistivity of the material, so

More accurate mixture rules have been established for various types of mixtures with components possessing
widely different properties, which the keen reader can find in P. L. Rossiter, The Electrical Resistivity of Metals

Thus, for a two-phase solid, the effective resistivity will be
ρeff = χα ρα + χβρβ

If the densities of the two phases are not too different, we can use weight fractions instead
of volume fractions. The series rule fails when the resistivities of the phases are vastly different. A major (and critical) tacit assumption here is that the current flow lines are all
parallel, so that no current crosses from one fiber to another. Only then can we say that the
effective resistance is Rfiber∕N. Further, notice that the rule fails when one phase has infinite
resistivity even if its volume fraction is very small.

COMBINED NORDHEIM AND MIXTURE RULES Brass is an alloy composed of Cu and Zn.

The alloy is a solid solution for Zn content less than 30 wt.%. Consider a brass component
made from sintering 90 at.% Cu and 10 at.% Zn brass powder. The component contains
dispersed air pores at 15v⁄o (vol.%). The Nordheim coefficient C of Zn in Cu is 300 nΩ m,
under very dilute conditions. Each Zn atom donates two, whereas each Cu atom of the matrix
donates one conduction electron, so that the Cu–Zn alloy has a higher electron concentration
than in the Cu crystal itself. Predict the effective resistivity of this brass component.
SOLUTION

We first calculate the resistivity of the alloy without the pores, which forms the continuous
phase in the powdered material. The simple Nordheim’s rule predicts that
ρbrass = ρcopper + CX(1 − X) = 17 nΩ m + 300(0.1)(1 − 0.1) = 44 nΩ m

The experimental value, about 40 nΩ m, is actually less because Zn has a valency of 2, and
when a Zn atom replaces a host Cu atom, it donates two electrons instead of one. We can
very roughly adjust the calculated resistivity by noting that a 10 at.% Zn addition increases
the conduction electron concentration by 10% and hence reduces the resistivity ρbrass by 10%
to 40 nΩ m.

EXAMPLE 2.16

CHAPTER 2

∙

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

The powdered metal has χd = 0.15, which is the volume fraction of the dispersed phase,
that is, the air pores, and ρc = ρbrass = 40 nΩ m is the resistivity of the continuous matrix.
The effective resistivity of the powdered metal is given by
ρeff = ρc

1 + 12 χd
1 + 21 (0.15)
= (40 nΩ m)
= 50.6 nΩ m
1 − χd
1 − (0.15)

If we use the simple conductivity mixture rule, ρeff is 47.1 nΩ m, and it is underestimated.
The effective Nordheim coefficient Ceff at the composition of interest is about 255 nΩ m,
which would give ρbrass = ρo + Ceff X(1 − X) = 40 nΩ m. It is left as an exercise to show
that the effective number of conduction electrons per atom in the alloy is 1 + X so that we
must divide the ρbrass calculated above by (1 + X) to obtain the correct resistivity of brass if
we use the listed value of C under dilute conditions. (See Question 2.10.)

2.4.2 TWO-PHASE ALLOY (Ag–Ni) RESISTIVITY
AND ELECTRICAL CONTACTS

Certain binary alloys, such as Pb–Sn and Cu–Ag, only exhibit a single-phase alloy
structure over very small composition ranges. For most compositions, these alloys
form a two-phase heterogeneous mixture of phases α and β. A typical phase diagram
for such a eutectic binary alloy system is shown in Figure 2.15a, which could be a
schematic scheme for the Cu–Ag system or the Pb–Sn system. The phase diagram
identifies the phases existing in the alloy at a given temperature and composition.
If the overall composition X is less than X1, then at T1, the alloy will consist of phase
α only. This phase is Cu rich. When the composition X is between X1 and X2, then
the alloy will consist of the two phases α and β randomly mixed. The phase α is Cu

rich (that is, it has composition X1) and the phase β is Ag rich (composition X2).
The relative amounts of each phase are determined by the well-known lever rule,
which means that we can determine the volume fractions of α and β, χα and χβ, as
the alloy composition is changed from X1 to X2.
For this alloy system, the dependence of the resistivity on the alloy composition
is shown in Figure 2.15b. Between O and X1 (% Ag), the solid is one phase (isomorphous); therefore, in this region, ρ increases with the concentration of Ag by
virtue of Nordheim’s rule. At X1, the solubility limit of Ag in Cu is reached, and
after X1, a second phase, which is β rich, is formed. Thus, in the composition range
X1 to X2, we have a mixture of α and β phases, so ρ is given by Equation 2.30 for
mixtures and is therefore less than that for a single-phase alloy of the same composition. Similarly, at the Ag end (X2 < X < 100%), as Cu is added to Ag, between
100% Ag and the solubility limit at X2, the resistivity is determined by Nordheim’s
rule. The expected behavior of the resistivity of an eutectic binary alloy over the
whole composition range is therefore as depicted in Figure 2.15b.
Electrical, thermal, and other physical properties make copper the most widely
used metallic conductor. For many electrical applications, high-conductivity copper,
having extremely low oxygen and other impurity contents, is produced. Although aluminum has a conductivity of only 60% of that of copper, it is also frequently used as
an electrical conductor. On the other hand, silver has a higher conductivity than copper,
but its cost prevents its use, except in specialized applications. Switches often have
silver contact specifications, though it is likely that the contact metal is actually a
silver alloy. In fact, silver has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity and is
consequently the natural choice for use in electrical contacts. In the form of alloys with
various other metals, it is used extensively in make-and-break switching applications
for currents of up to about 600 A. The precious metals, gold, platinum, and palladium,
are extremely resistant to corrosion; consequently, in the form of various alloys, particularly with Ag, they are widely used in electrical contacts. For example, Ag–Ni alloys
are common electrical contact materials for the switches in many household appliances.
It is frequently necessary to improve the mechanical properties of a metal alloy
without significantly impairing its electrical conductivity. Solid-solution alloying
improves mechanical strength, but at the expense of conductivity. A compromise must
often be found between electrical and mechanical properties. Most often, strength is
enhanced by introducing a second phase that does not have such an adverse effect on
the conductivity. For example, Ag–Pd alloys form a solid solution such that the resistivity increases appreciably due to Nordheim’s rule. The resistivity of Ag–Pd is mainly
controlled by the scattering of electrons from Pd atoms randomly mixed in the Ag
matrix. In contrast, Ag and Ni form a two-phase alloy, a mixture of Ag-rich and Nirich phases. The Ag–Ni alloy is almost as strong as the Ag–Pd alloy, but it has a
lower resistivity because the mixture rule volume averages the two resistivities.

2.5

THE HALL EFFECT AND HALL DEVICES

An important phenomenon that we can comfortably explain using the “electron as a
particle” concept is the Hall effect, which is illustrated in Figure 2.16. When we apply
a magnetic field in a perpendicular direction to the applied field (which is driving
the current), we find there is a transverse field in the sample that is perpendicular

to the direction of both the applied field Ex and the magnetic field Bz, that is, in the
y direction. Putting a voltmeter across the sample, as in Figure 2.16, gives a voltage
reading VH. The applied field Ex drives a current Jx in the sample. The electrons
move in the −x direction, with a drift velocity vdx. Because of the magnetic field,
there is a force (called the Lorentz force) acting on each electron and given by
Fy = −evdx Bz. The direction of this Lorentz force is the −y direction, which we can
show by applying the corkscrew rule, because, in vector notation, the force F acting
on a charge q moving with a velocity v in a magnetic field B is given through the
vector product
F = qv × B
[2.35]
All moving charges experience the Lorentz force in Equation 2.35 as shown
schematically in Figure 2.17. In our example of a metal in Figure 2.16, this Lorentz
force is the −y direction, so it pushes the electrons downward, as a result of which
there is a negative charge accumulation near the bottom of the sample and a positive
charge near the top of the sample, due to exposed metal ions (e.g., Cu+).
The accumulation of electrons near the bottom results in an internal electric field
EH in the −y direction. This is called the Hall field and gives rise to a Hall voltage
VH between the top and bottom of the sample. Electron accumulation continues until
the increase in EH is sufficient to stop the further accumulation of electrons. When
this happens, the magnetic-field force evdxBz that pushes the electrons down just balances the force eEH that prevents further accumulation. Therefore, in the steady state,
eEH = evdxBz

A useful parameter called the Hall coefficient RH is defined as
RH =

JxBz

[2.37]

The quantity RH measures the resulting Hall field, along y, per unit transverse
applied current and magnetic field. The larger RH, the greater Ey for a given Jx and
Bz. Therefore, RH is a gauge of the magnitude of the Hall effect. A comparison of
Equations 2.36 and 2.37 shows that for metals,
1
RH = −
en

[2.38]

The reason for the negative sign is that EH = −Ey, which means that EH is in the −y
direction.
Inasmuch as RH depends inversely on the free electron concentration, its value in
metals is much less than that in semiconductors. In fact, Hall-effect devices (such as
magnetometers) always employ a semiconductor material, simply because the RH is
larger. Table 2.4 lists the Hall coefficients of a few metals. RH is typically negative for
most metals, although there also many metals that exhibit a positive Hall coefficient
(see Be in Table 2.4). The reasons for the latter involve the band theory of solids, which
we will discuss in Chapter 4. Table 2.4 also shows the theoretical values for RH calculated from Equation 2.38 by using the atomic concentration and number of expected
conduction electrons. The agreement is surprisingly good for some of the metals (Al,
K, Na) even though we used simple classical ideas in the derivation of RH.11

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

Since the Hall voltage depends on the product of two quantities, the current
density Jx and the transverse applied magnetic field Bz, we see that the effect naturally multiplies two independently variable quantities. Therefore, it provides a means
of carrying out a multiplication process. One obvious application is measuring the
power dissipated in a load, where the load current and voltage are multiplied. There
are many instances when it is necessary to measure magnetic fields, and the Hall
effect is ideally suited to such applications. Commercial Hall-effect magnetometers
can measure magnetic fields as low as 10 nT, which should be compared to the
earth’s magnetic field of ∼50 μT. Depending on the application, manufacturers use
different semiconductors to obtain the desired sensitivity. Hall-effect semiconductor
devices are generally inexpensive, small, and reliable. Typical commercial, linear
Hall-effect sensor devices are capable of providing a Hall voltage of ∼10 mV per mT
of applied magnetic field.
The Hall effect is also widely used in magnetically actuated electronic switches.
The application of a magnetic field, say from a magnet, results in a Hall voltage that
is amplified to trigger an electronic switch. The switches invariably use Si and are
readily available from various companies. Hall-effect electronic switches are used as
noncontacting keyboard and panel switches that last almost forever, as they have no
mechanical contact assembly. Another advantage is that the electrical contact is
“bounce” free. There are a variety of interesting applications for Hall-effect switches,
ranging from ignition systems, to speed controls, position detectors, alignment controls,
brushless dc motor commutators, etc.
EXAMPLE 2.17

HALL-EFFECT WATTMETER The Hall effect can be used to implement a wattmeter to measure electrical power dissipated in a load. The schematic sketch of the Hall-effect wattmeter
is shown in Figure 2.18, where the Hall-effect sample is typically a semiconductor material
(usually Si). The load current IL passes through two coils, which are called current coils and
are shown as C in Figure 2.18. These coils set up a magnetic field Bz such that Bz ∝ IL. The
Hall-effect sample is positioned in this field between the coils. The voltage VL across the load
drives a current Ix = VL∕R through the sample, where R is a series resistance that is much
larger than the resistance of the sample and that of the load. Normally, the current Ix is very

small and negligible compared to the load current. If w is the width of the sample, then the
measured Hall voltage is
VH = wEH = wRHJxBz ∝ IxBz ∝ VLIL

which is the electrical power dissipated in the load. The voltmeter that measures VH can now
be calibrated to read directly the power dissipated in the load.
Show that if RH is the Hall coefficient and σ is the conductivity of a metal,
then the drift mobility of the conduction electrons is given by

HALL MOBILITY

μd = ∣σ RH∣

EXAMPLE 2.18

[2.39]

The Hall coefficient and conductivity of copper at 300 K have been measured to be
−0.54 × 10−10 m3 A−1 s−1 and 5.9 × 107 Ω−1 m−1, respectively. Calculate the drift mobility
of electrons in copper.
SOLUTION

Consider the expression for
RH =

−1
en

Since the conductivity is given by σ = enμd, we can substitute for en to obtain
RH =

−μd
σ

or

μd = −RHσ

which is Equation 2.39. The drift mobility can thus be determined from RH and σ.
The product of σ and RH is called the Hall mobility μH. Some values for the Hall
mobility of electrons in various metals are listed in Table 2.4. From the expression in Equation 2.39, we get
μd = ∣(−0.54 × 10−10 m3 A−1 s−1)(5.9 × 107 Ω−1 m−1)∣ = 3.2 × 10−3 m2 V−1 s−1

It should be mentioned that Equation 2.39 is an oversimplification. The actual relationship
involves a numerical factor that multiplies the right term in Equation 2.39. The factor depends
on the charge carrier scattering mechanism that controls the drift mobility.
CONDUCTION ELECTRON CONCENTRATION FROM THE HALL EFFECT

Using the electron drift mobility from Hall-effect measurements (Table 2.4), calculate the concentration of
conduction electrons in copper, and then determine the average number of electrons contributed to the free electron gas per copper atom in the solid.

SOLUTION

The number of conduction electrons is given by n = σ∕eμd. The conductivity of copper is 5.9 ×
107 Ω−1 m−1, whereas from Table 2.4, the electron drift mobility is 3.2 × 10−3 m2 V−1 s−1. So,
n=

(5.9 × 107 Ω−1 m−1 )
[ (1.6 × 10−19 C) (3.2 × 10−3 m2 V−1 s−1 ) ]

= 1.15 × 1029 m−3

Since the concentration of copper atoms is 8.5 × 1028 m−3, the average number of electrons
contributed per atom is (1.15 × 1029 m−3)∕(8.5 × 1028 m−3) ≈ 1.36.

THERMAL CONDUCTION

2.6.1 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
Experience tells us that metals are both good electrical and good thermal conductors.
We may therefore surmise that the free conduction electrons in a metal must also
play a role in heat conduction. Our conjecture is correct for metals, but not for other
materials. The transport of heat in a metal is accomplished by the electron gas (conduction electrons), whereas in nonmetals, the conduction is due to lattice vibrations.
When a metal piece is heated at one end, the amplitude of the atomic vibrations,
and thus the average kinetic energy of the electrons, in this region increases, as
depicted in Figure 2.19. Electrons gain energy from energetic atomic vibrations when
the two collide. By virtue of their increased random motion, these energetic electrons
then transfer the extra energy to the colder regions by colliding with the atomic
vibrations there. Thus, electrons act as “energy carriers.”
The thermal conductivity of a material, as its name implies, measures the ease
with which heat, that is, thermal energy, can be transported through the medium.
Consider the metal rod shown in Figure 2.20, which is heated at one end. Heat will
flow from the hot end to the cold end. Experiments show that the rate of heat flow,

Historically, Wiedemann and Franz noted in 1853 that κ∕σ is the same for all metals at the same temperature.
Lorenz in 1881 showed that κ∕σ is proportional to the temperature with a proportionality constant that is nearly
the same for many metals. The law stated in equation 2.42 reflects both observations. By the way, Lorenz, who
was a Dane, should not be confused with Lorentz, who was Dutch.

pure metals is inversely proportional to the temperature, we can immediately conclude that the thermal conductivity of these metals must be relatively temperature
independent at room temperature and above.
Figure 2.22 shows the temperature dependence of κ for copper and aluminum
down to the lowest temperatures. It can be seen that for these two metals, above
∼100 K, the thermal conductivity becomes temperature independent, in agreement
with Equation 2.42. Qualitatively, above ∼100 K, κ is constant, because heat conduction depends essentially on the rate at which the electron transfers energy from one
atomic vibration to another as it collides with them (Figure 2.19). This rate of energy
transfer depends on the mean speed of the electron u, which increases only fractionally with the temperature. In fact, the fractionally small increase in u is more than
sufficient to carry the energy from one collision to another and thereby excite more
energetic lattice vibrations in the colder regions.
Nonmetals do not have any free conduction electrons inside the crystal to transfer thermal energy from hot to cold regions of the material. In nonmetals, the energy
transfer involves lattice vibrations, that is, atomic vibrations of the crystal. We know
that we can view the atoms and bonds in a crystal as balls connected together through
springs as shown for one chain of atoms in Figure 2.23. As we know from the kinetic

molecular theory, all the atoms would be vibrating and the average vibrational kinetic
energy would be proportional to the temperature. Intuitively, as depicted in Figure 2.23,
when we heat one end of a crystal, we set up large-amplitude atomic vibrations at
this hot end. The springs couple the vibrations to neighboring atoms and thus allow
the large-amplitude vibrations to propagate, as a vibrational wave, to the cooler
regions of the crystal. If we were to grab the left-end atom in Figure 2.23 and vibrate
it violently, we would be sending vibrational waves down the ball-spring-ball chain.
The efficiency of heat transfer depends not only on the efficiency of coupling
between the atoms, and hence on the nature of interatomic bonding, but also on how
the vibrational waves propagate in the crystal and how they are scattered by crystal
imperfections and by their interactions with other vibrational waves; this topic is
discussed in Chapter 4. The stronger the coupling, the greater will be the thermal
conductivity, a trend that is intuitive but also borne out by experiments. Diamond
has an exceptionally strong covalent bond and also has a very high thermal conductivity; κ ≈ 1000 W m−1 K−1. On the other hand, polymers have weak secondary
bonding between the polymer chains and their thermal conductivities are very poor;
κ < 1 W m−1 K−1.
The thermal conductivity, in general, depends on the temperature. Different
classes of materials exhibit different κ values and also different κ versus T behavior.
Table 2.5 summarizes κ at room temperature for various classes of materials. Notice
how ceramics have a very large range of κ values.

SOLUTION

Recall that in Example 2.15, we found the electrical resistivity of the same bronze by using
the mixture rule in Equation 2.32 in Section 2.4. We can use the same mixture rule again
here, but we need the thermal conductivity of 95∕5 bronze. From κ∕σT = CWFL, we have
κ = σTCWFL = (1 × 107)(300)(2.44 × 10−8) = 73.2 W m−1 K−1

the range of conductivities exhibited by a variety of solids. Based on typical values
of the conductivity, it is possible to empirically classify various materials into conductors, semiconductors, and insulators as in Figure 2.25. It is apparent that nonmetals are not perfect insulators with zero conductivity. There is no well-defined sharp
boundary between what we call insulators and semiconductors. Conductors are intimately identified with metals. It is more appropriate to view insulators as high
resistivity (or low conductivity) materials. In general terms, current conduction is
due to the drift of mobile charge carriers through a solid by the application of an
electric field. Each of the drifting species of charge carriers contributes to the
observed current. In metals, there are only free electrons. In nonmetals there are
other types of charge carriers that can drift.

2.7.1 SEMICONDUCTORS
A perfect Si crystal has each Si atom bonded to four neighbors, and each covalent
bond has two shared electrons as we had shown in Figure 1.61a. We know from
classical physics (the kinetic molecular theory and Boltzmann distribution) that all
the atoms in the crystal are executing vibrations with a distribution of energies. As
the temperature increases, the distribution spreads to higher energies. Statistically
some of the atomic vibrations will be sufficiently energetic to rupture a bond as
indicated in Figure 2.26a. This releases an electron from the bond which is free to
wander inside the crystal. The free electron can drift in the presence of an applied
field; it is called a conduction electron. As an electron has been removed from a
region of the crystal that is otherwise neutral, the broken-bond region has a net
positive charge. This broken-bond region is called a hole (h+). An electron in a
neighboring bond can jump and repair this bond and thereby create a hole in its

Figure 2.26 (a) Thermal vibrations of the atoms rupture a bond and release a free electron into the crystal. A hole is left

this bond and thereby create a hole in its original site; the hole has been displaced. (c) When a field is applied, both
holes and electrons contribute to electrical conduction.

2 .7

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF NONMETALS

original site as shown in Figure 2.26b. Effectively, the hole has been displaced in
the opposite direction to the electron jump by this bond switching. Holes can also
wander in the crystal by the repetition of bond switching. When a field is applied,
both holes and electrons contribute to electrical conduction as in Figure 2.26c. For
all practical purposes, these holes behave as if they were free positively charged
particles (independent of the original electrons) inside the crystal. In the presence
of an applied field, holes drift along the field direction and contribute to conduction
just as the free electrons released from the broken bonds drift in the opposite direction and contribute to conduction.
It is also possible to create free electrons or holes by intentionally doping a
semiconductor crystal, that is substituting impurity atoms for some of the Si atoms.
Defects can also generate free carriers. The simplest example is nonstoichiometric
ZnO that is shown in Figure 1.57b which has excess Zn. The electrons from the
excess Zn are free to wander in the crystal and hence contribute to conduction.
Suppose that n and p are the concentrations of electrons and holes in a semiconductor crystal. If electrons and holes have drift mobilities of μe and μh, respectively,
then the overall conductivity of the crystal is given by
σ = epμh + enμe

[2.47]

Unless a semiconductor has been heavily doped, the concentrations n and p are
much smaller than the electron concentration in a metal. Even though carrier drift
mobilities in most semiconductors are higher than electron drift mobilities in metals,
semiconductors have much lower conductivities due to their lower concentration of
free charge carriers.
The hall effect in a sample where there are both
negative and positive charge carriers, for example, electrons and holes in a semiconductor,
involves not only the concentrations of electrons and holes, n and p, respectively, but also the
electron and hole drift mobilities, μe and μh. We first have to reinterpret the relationship
between the drift velocity and the electric field E.
If μe is the drift mobility and ve is the drift velocity of the electrons, then we already
know that ve = μeE. This has been derived by considering the net electrostatic force eE acting on a single electron and the imparted acceleration a = eE∕me. The drift is therefore due
to the net force Fnet = eE experienced by a conduction electron. If we were to keep eE as the
net force Fnet acting on a single electron, then we would have found
HALL EFFECT IN SEMICONDUCTORS

ve =

μe
Fnet
e

[2.48]

Equation 2.48 emphasizes the fact that drift is due to a net force Fnet acting on an electron.
A similar expression would also apply to the drift of a hole in a semiconductor.
When both electrons and holes are present in a semiconductor sample, both charge carriers experience a Lorentz force in the same direction since they would be drifting in the
opposite directions as illustrated in Figure 2.27. Thus, both holes and electrons tend to pile
near the bottom surface. The magnitude of the Lorentz force, however, will be different since
the drift mobilities and hence drift velocities will be different in general. Once equilibrium
is reached, there should be no current flowing in the y direction as we have an open circuit.
Suppose that more holes have accumulated near the bottom surface so there is a built-in

electron and hole drift velocities in the −y and +y directions, respectively, as if the electric
field Ey existed alone in the +y direction. The net current along y is zero, which means that
Jy = Jh + Je = epvhy + envey = 0

[2.49]

From Equation 2.49 we obtain
pvhy = −nvey

[2.50]

We note that either the electron or the hole drift velocity must be reversed from its usual
direction; for example, holes drifting in the opposite direction to Ey. The net force acting on
the charge carriers cannot be zero. This is impossible when two types of carriers are involved
and both carriers are drifting along y to give a net current Jy that is zero. This is what Equation 2.49 represents. We therefore conclude that, along y, both the electron and the hole must
experience a driving force to drift them. The net force experienced by the carriers, as shown
in Figure 2.27, is
Fhy = eEy − evhxBz

and

−Fey = eEy + evexBz

[2.51]

where vhx and vex are the hole and electron drift velocities, respectively, along x. In general,
the drift velocity is determined by the net force acting on a charge carrier; that is, from
Equation 2.48
Fhy =

From Equation 2.52 we can substitute for vhy and vey in Equation 2.50 to obtain
pμhEy − pμ2hExBz = −nμeEy − nμ2eExBz

or
Ey(pμh + nμe) = BzEx( pμ2h − nμ2e)

[2.53]

We now consider what happens along the x direction. The total current density is finite

We can use Equation 2.54 to substitute for Ex in Equation 2.53, to obtain

or
RH =

where b = μe∕μh. It is clear that the Hall coefficient depends on both the drift mobility ratio
and the concentrations of holes and electrons. For p > nb2, RH will be positive and for
p < nb2, it will be negative. We should note that when only one type of carrier is involved,
for example, electrons only, the Jy = 0 requirement means that Jy = envey = 0, or vey = 0.
The drift velocity along y can only be zero, if the net driving force Fey along y is zero. This
occurs when eEy − evex Bz = 0, that is, when the Lorentz force just balances the force due to
the built-in field.
HALL COEFFICIENT OF INTRINSIC SILICON At room temperature, a pure silicon crystal
(called intrinsic silicon) has electron and hole concentrations n = p = ni = 1.0 × 1010 cm−3,
and electron and hole drift mobilities μe = 1350 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 450 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Calculate the Hall coefficient and compare it with a typical metal.
SOLUTION

Given n = p = ni = 1.0 × 1010 cm−3, μe = 1350 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh = 450 cm2 V−1 s−1,
we have

which is orders of magnitude larger than that for a typical metal. All Hall-effect devices use

hence drift by diffusion in the presence of a field. A positive ion at an interstitial
site such as that shown in Figure 2.28a always prefers to jump into a neighboring
interstitial site along the direction of the field because it experiences an effective
force in this direction. When an ion with charge qion jumps a distance d along the
field, its potential energy decreases by qionEd. If it tries to jump in the opposite
direction, it has to do work qionEd against the force of the field. We know from
Chapter 1 that the interstitial ion also has to overcome a potential energy barrier to
be able to jump into a neighboring available site, i.e., diffusion is a thermally activated process. Thus, we expect the conductivity to be thermally activated. Further,
vacancies are well known to aid the diffusion of ions. For example, a cation in
Figure 2.28a can jump into a nearby cation vacancy and thereby drift and contribute
to conduction. A Schottky defect in an ionic crystal involves a missing cation-anion
pair14. Such defects play an important role in many ionic crystals such as alkali
halides (NaCl type ionic solids) because the cation diffusion intimately involves
Schottky defects. There may also be impurity ions in the crystal that can contribute
to conduction, especially if they are small and can diffuse easily. Table 2.6 summarizes some typical examples.
Deviations from stoichiometry in compound solids often lead to the generation
of mobile electrons (or holes) and point defects such as vacancies. Therefore, there
are electrons, holes, and various mobile ions available for conduction under an
applied field as depicted in Figure 2.28a. Many glasses contain a certain concentration of mobile ions in the structure. An example of a Na+ ion in silica glass is shown
in Figure 2.28b. Aided by the field, the Na+ can jump from one interstice to a
neighboring interstice along the field and thereby drift in the glass and contribute to

14

Remember from Chapter 1 that, overall, the ionic crystal must be neutral, which is the reason a Schottky
defect has an anion and cation vacancy pair. If there are interstitial impurity cations in the crystal, then there
would need to be an equal number of electrons, additional anions, or host cation vacancies to maintain charge
neutrality. The study of defects and ion diffusion in ceramics and glasses is a highly active research field.

current conduction. The conduction process is then essentially field-directed diffusion.
Ordinary window glass, in fact, has a high concentration of Na+ ions in the structure
and becomes reasonably conducting above 300–400 °C. (See photo on page 172.)
Conductivity σ of the material depends on all the conduction mechanisms with
each species of charge carrier making a contribution, so it is given by
σ = ∑ qiniμi

[2.57]

where ni is the concentration, qi is the charge carried by the charge carrier species
of type i (for electrons and holes qi = e), and μi is the drift mobility of these carriers. The dominant conduction mechanism in Equation 2.57 is often quite difficult to
uniquely identify. Further, it may change with temperature, composition, and ambient
conditions such as the air pressure as in some oxide ceramics. For many ceramics
and glasses the conductivity has been observed to follow an exponential or Arrheniustype temperature dependence so that σ is thermally activated,

Figure 2.29 shows examples of the temperature dependence of conductivity for
various high-resistivity solids such as ionic crystals (ceramics) and glasses. When
Equation 2.58a is plotted as log(σ) versus 1∕T, the result is a straight line with a
negative slope that indicates the activation energy Eσ. Equation 2.58 is useful in
predicting the conductivity at different temperatures and evaluating the temperature
stability of an insulator.
The conductivity qiniμi arising from a given species of ions, such as Na+, in
Equation 2.57 needs the concentration ni of these ions and their drift mobility μi.
Higher the diffusion coefficient Di for a particular species of ions (e.g., Na+) the
more mobile are the ions, i.e., higher the drift mobility μi. The two quantities are
related through the Einstein relation,15
1 e
μi = ( )Di

[2.59]

where f is a numerical factor, called the Haven ratio, that is 1 or less, and accounts
for the fact that the diffusion of ions maybe correlated. In simple terms, if the diffusion of the ions are uncorrelated with each other then f is 1. If the diffusion of an
ion is influenced by other ions, then the diffusion is not totally random and f
becomes less than 1.
15
The Einstein relation is proved in Chapter 5 for electrons in a semiconductor. For now, we can take it as given
based on the intuitive link between the mobility (μi) of an ion and its ability to diffuse (Di). (Equation 2.59 is simple
but it does have a few assumptions as mentioned in Chapter 5.)

If we were to carefully measure the slope of the line in Figure 2.29 for KCl, we would find

CONDUCTIVITY OF SODA-SILICA GLASS Consider soda-silica glass of composition
25%Na2O-75%SiO2, which represents (Na2O)0.25(SiO2)0.75. Its density is 2.39 g cm−3. The
diffusion coefficient D of Na+ in this soda-silica glass at 400 °C is 1.03 × 10−8 cm2 s−1
and the Haven ratio f is 0.53. Calculate the conductivity of 25%Na2O-75%SiO2 glass at
400 °C and compare it with the measured value of 6.81 × 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1. What is your
conclusion?
SOLUTION

We first calculate the concentration of Na+ ions in the glass. If MNa, MSi, and MO are the
atomic masses of Na, Si, and O, respectively, the molecular mass of (Na2O)0.25(SiO2)0.75 is
M = 0.25(2MNa + MO) + 0.75(MSi + 2MO) = 0.25(2 × 23.0 + 16.0) + 0.75(28.1 + 2 × 16)
= 60.6 g mol−1

Given the density d, the concentration of (Na2O)0.25(SiO2)0.75 units (“molecules”) is
nmolecule =

dNA (2.39 g cm−3 ) (6.022 × 1023 mol−1 )
=

Each of these (Na2O)0.25(SiO2)0.75 units has 0.25 × 2 number of Na atoms so that the Na+-ion
concentration is
ni = 0.25 × 2 × 2.38 × 1022 cm−3 = 1.19 × 1022 cm−3.

We need the drift mobility μi of the Na+ ions, which is

conductivity is
σ = eniμi = (1.602 × 10−19 C)(1.19 × 1022 cm−3)(3.35 × 10−7 cm2 s−1)

which is very close to the experimental value. It is left as an exercise to show that
at 400 °C, the conductivity of 24%NaO2-76%SiO2 glass in Figure 2.29 is roughly
6 × 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1.

SKIN EFFECT: HF RESISTANCE OF A CONDUCTOR

SKIN EFFECT: HF RESISTANCE OF A CONDUCTOR

Consider the cylindrical conductor shown in Figure 2.30a, which is carrying a current I into the paper (×). The magnetic field B of I is clockwise. Consider two
magnetic field values B1 and B2, which are shown in Figure 2.30a. B1 is inside the
core and B2 is just outside the conductor.
Assume that the conductor is divided into two conductors. The hypothetical
cut is taken just outside of B1. The conductor in Figure 2.30a is now cut into a
hollow cylinder and a smaller solid cylinder, as shown in Figure 2.30b and c,
respectively. The currents I1 and I2 in the solid and hollow cylinders sum to I. We
can arrange things and choose B1 such that our cut gives I1 = I2 = 12 I. Obviously,
I1 flowing in the inner conductor is threaded (or linked) by both B1 and B2.
(Remember that B1 is just inside the conductor in Figure 2.30b, so it threads at
least 99% of I1.) On the other hand, the outer conductor is only threaded by B2,
simply because I2 flows in the hollow cylinder and there is no current in the hollow, which means that B1 is not threaded by I2. Clearly, I1 threads more magnetic
field than I2 and thus conductor (c) has a higher inductance than (b). Recall that
inductance is defined as the total magnetic flux threaded per unit current. Consequently, an ac current will prefer paths near the surface where the inductive
impedance is smaller. As the frequency increases, the current is confined more and
more to the surface region.
For a given conductor, we can assume that most of the current flows in a surface
region of depth δ, called the skin depth, as indicated in Figure 2.31. In the central

region, the current will be negligibly small. The skin depth will obviously depend
on the frequency ω. To find δ, we must solve Maxwell’s equations in a conductive
medium, a tedious task that, fortunately, has been done by others. We can therefore
simply take the result that the skin depth δ is given by
Skin depth for

δ=

[2.60]

where ω is the angular frequency of the current, σ is the conductivity (σ is constant
from dc up to ∼1014 Hz in metals), and μ is the magnetic permeability of the
medium, which is the product of the absolute (free space) permeability μo and the
relative permeability μr.
We can imagine the central conductor as a resistance R in series with an inductance L. Intuitively, those factors that enhance the inductive impedance ωL over the
resistance R will also tend to emphasize the skin effect and will hence tend to
decrease the skin depth. For example, the greater the permeability of the conducting
medium, the stronger the magnetic field inside the conductor, and hence the larger
the inductance of the central region. The higher the frequency of the current, the
greater the inductive impedance ωL compared with R and the more significant is the
skin effect. The greater is the conductivity σ the smaller is R compared with ωL and
hence the more important is the skin effect. All these dependences are accounted for
in Equation 2.60.
With the skin depth known, the effective cross-sectional area is given approximately by
A = πa2 − π(a − δ)2 ≈ 2πaδ

where δ2 is neglected (δ ≪ a). The ac resistance rac of the conductor per unit length
is therefore
rac =

ρ
≈
A 2πaδ

[2.61]

where ρ is the ac resistivity at the frequency of interest, which for all practical purposes is equal to the dc resistivity of the metal. Equation 2.60 clearly shows that as
ω increases, δ decreases, by virtue of δ ∝ ω−1∕2 and, as a result, rac increases.

2.8

SKIN EFFECT: HF RESISTANCE OF A CONDUCTOR

179

From this discussion, it is obvious that the skin effect arises because the magnetic field of the ac current in the conductor restricts the current flow to the surface
region within a depth of δ < a. Since the current can only flow in the surface region,
there is an effective increase in the resistance due to a decrease in the cross-sectional
area for current flow. Taking this effective area for current flow as 2πaδ leads to
Equation 2.61.
The skin effect plays an important role in electronic engineering because it
limits the use of solid-core conductors in high-frequency applications. As the signal
frequencies reach and surpass the gigahertz (109 Hz) range, the transmission of the
signal over a long distance becomes almost impossible through an ordinary, solidmetal conductor. We must then resort to pipes (or waveguides).
SKIN EFFECT FROM DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS Using dimensional analysis, obtain the
general form of the equation for the skin depth δ in terms of the angular frequency of the
current ω, conductivity σ, and permeability μ.
SOLUTION

The skin effect depends on the angular frequency ω of the current, the conductivity σ, and
the magnetic permeability μ of the conducting medium. In the most general way, we can
group these effects as
[δ] = [ω]x[σ]y[μ]z

where the indices x, y, and z are to be determined. We then substitute the dimensions of each
quantity in this expression. The dimensions of each, in terms of the fundamental units, are
as follows:

= (kg m s−2)(C−1 s)(m)

Therefore,
[m] = [s−1]x[C2 s kg−1 m−3]y[kg m C−2]z

Matching the dimensions of both sides, we see that y = z; otherwise C and kg do not
cancel.
For m

1 = −3y + z

For s

0 = −x + y

For C or kg

0 = 2y − 2z

or

0 = −y + z

Clearly, x = y = z = − 12 is the only possibility. Then, δ ∝ [ωσμ]−1∕2. It should be reemphasized that the dimensional analysis is not a proof of the skin depth expression, but a
consistency check that assures confidence in the equation.

Copper has ρdc = 1.70 × 10−8 Ω m or σdc = 5.9 × 107 Ω−1 m−1 and a relative permeability
near unity.
SOLUTION

Per unit length, rdc = ρdc∕πa2 and at high frequencies, from Equation 2.61, rac = ρdc∕2πaδ.
Therefore, rac∕rdc = a∕2δ.

The resistance has increased by 24 times. At 1 GHz, the increase is 240 times. Furthermore, the current is confined to a surface region of about ∼2 × 10−5 (20 μm) at 10 MHz
and ∼2 × 10−6 m (2 μm) at 1 GHz, so most of the material is wasted. This is exactly the
reason why solid conductors would not be used for high-frequency work. At very high frequencies, in the gigahertz range and above, are reached, the best bet would be to use pipes
(waveguides).
One final comment is appropriate. An inductor wound from a copper wire would have
a certain Q (quality factor) value17 that depends inversely on its resistance. At high frequencies, Q would drop, because the current would be limited to the surface of the wire. One way
to overcome this problem is to use a thick conductor that has a surface coating of higherconductivity metal, such as silver. This is what the early radio engineers practiced. In fact,
tank circuits of high-power radio transmitters often have coils made from copper tubes with
a coolant flowing inside.

AC CONDUCTIVITY σac

So far we have only considered the steady state motion of electrons in the presence
of a dc electric field −Ex along x and resulting drift along x. Under these conditions,
the average velocity vdx of electrons is time independent, that is, it is constant and
given by Equation 2.9, vdx = eτEx∕me. In general, vdx may be time dependent due to
two reasons. Either the field is time dependent or the electric field has just been
applied so that the electrons have just started to accelerate. Suppose, we treat a conduction electron in a solid as a particle, and think of it as moving through a viscous
medium as in Figure 2.32a, which tries to slow it down so that its velocity does not
build up to infinity. Collisions with and deflections from the metal ions have the
overall effect of hindering the electron’s motion in the x-direction, which we can
17
The Q value refers to the quality factor of an inductor, which is defined by Q = ωoL∕R, where ωo is the
resonant frequency, L is the inductance, and R is the resistance due to the losses in the inductor.

represent through the action of a resistive force as in mechanics. Such a resistive
force in mechanics is proportional to the velocity and we can write it as Kvdx, in
which K is a constant. Thus, the general equation of motion of an electron, from net
force = mass × acceleration, should be
eEx − Kvdx = me

dvdx
dt

[2.62]

where eEx is the driving force. The resistive force Kvdx opposes the continual buildup of vdx to infinity as shown in Figure 2.32a. This equation is taken straight from
classical mechanics.18
After sometime, a steady state is reached and the drift velocity vdx is time independent. Equation 2.62 should reduce to the familiar form, vdx = eτEx∕me when
dvdx∕dt = 0. Therefore, the constant K must be K = me∕τ. With this in Equation 2.62,
the general equation of motion of a conduction electron is
eEx − (me∕τ)vdx = me

[2.63]

This needs to be solved for vdx(t) for a given time dependent Ex = Ex(t) and the
solution determines the current density via Jx(t) = envdx(t).

constant field Exo is
vdx(t) = vdx(∞)[1 − exp(−t∕τ)]
[2.64]
18
A similar version of it is used to describe the motion of a “body” like a car driven by a mechanical force
against ground and air friction. In mechanics, opposing resistive forces are always proportional to the velocity.
The greater the car velocity, the greater is the resistance. Since we are treating the electron like a football,
Equation 2.62 is therefore a general description of its motion within classical phenomenology.

where vdx(∞) = eτExo∕me. Clearly, vdx(t) rises exponentially with time and then
saturates at vdx(∞) after t ≫ τ as illustrated in Figure 2.32b. The rise time constant
τ is the mean free time and its value is typically ∼10−14 s. Thus, the mean free time
determines the transient behavior. The current density Jx is envdx, so it follows the
behavior of Equation 2.64 as shown in Figure 2.32b.
As soon as a step voltage is applied to a conductor, the current does not follow
the voltage but rises exponentially as if it were an RL circuit. We assumed no inductance, nor stray capacitance, but nonetheless, found an intrinsic delay in the current
density. Although this delay is very short, τ ∼10−14 s, it does nonetheless exist. A
ball dropped into a long column of viscous liquid eventually reaches a terminal
velocity when the pull of the gravitational force on the ball is balanced by the viscous
drag it experiences through the liquid.

The drift velocity now depends on the frequency. The current density is then given
by Equation 2.2, Jx = envdx, so that it also depends on the frequency, similar to
Equation 2.66. The AC conductivity σac is defined by Jx = σacEx, so that

where σo, by definition, is given by e2nτ∕me and represents the dc conductivity. As
the frequency increases, ∣σac∣ decreases as shown in Figure 2.32c. From Equation 2.67,
we can write σac = σ′ − jσ″ in terms of real and imaginary parts, that is,

[2.68]

The Joule loss, that is what we normally consider as the energy dissipation
associated with I 2R or V 2∕R, depends on the real part of σac and can be written
as 12 σ′E2xo. As long as ωτ < 1 or ω < 1014 s−1, σac has a larger real part and we have
a finite joule loss. But, when ωτ ≫ 1 or ω ≫ 1014 s−1, σ′ is proportional to 1∕ω2
and so is the Joule loss, decreasing sharply with frequency. As shown in Chapter 9,
absorption of light in certain semiconductors in the infrared region is controlled by
σ′ and its frequency dependence.
19
The exponential notation means that we are representing Exocos(ωt) as Exoexp( jωt), similar to the use of phasors
in AC circuits, so we must take the real part at the end of our derivation. Note that many physics books use
exp(−jωt), which causes sign change in j in subsequent equations.

copper from dc to 100 GHz and 100 THz?
SOLUTION

The angular frequency ω = 2π(100 × 109 Hz) = 6.28 × 1011 rad s−1 and ωτ = (6.28 ×

so the decrease in the real part of the conductivity (power loss) is negligible and notice that
σ′ ≫ σ″. There is something however that does increase the resistance of a metal wire carrying a high frequency current, which is called the skin effect as described in Section 2.8.
We need to repeat the above calculation at 100 THz where ω = 2π(100 × 1012 Hz) =
6.28 × 1014 rad s−1 and ωτ = (6.28 × 1014 rad s−1)(2.5 × 10−14 s) = 15.7 and substituting
into Equation 2.67, we find
σac

in which σ″ ≫ σ′. Notice that σ′ is now much smaller than σo (by a factor of 250).
Consider an ac voltage Vme jωt applied across a
conductor of length L. We can represent this ac voltage as a phasor with a magnitude
V = Vm∕ √2 and zero phase angle. The resulting current would be a phasor with a magnitude I
and some phase angle ϕ. We can find I from I = VY where Y is the complex admittance of

2.10.1 CONDUCTION IN THIN METAL FILMS
The resistivity of a material, as listed in materials tables and in our analysis of
conduction, refers to the resistivity of the material in bulk form; that is, any dimension of the specimen is much larger than the mean free path for electron scattering.
In such cases resistivity is determined by scattering from lattice vibrations and, if
significant, scattering from various impurities and defects in the crystal. In certain
applications, notably microelectronics, metal films are widely used to provide electrical conduction paths to and from the semiconductor devices. Various methods
are used to deposit thin films. In many applications, the metal film is simply deposited onto a substrate, such as a semiconductor or an insulator (e.g., SiO2), by physical vapor deposition (PVD), that is, by vacuum deposition, which typically
involves either evaporation or sputtering. In thermal evaporation, the metal is
evaporated from a heated source in a vacuum chamber as depicted in Figure 1.24.
As the metal atoms, evaporated from the source, impinge and adhere to the semiconductor surface, they form a metal film which is often highly polycrystalline.
Stated differently, the metal atoms in the vapor condense to form a metal film on
a suitably placed substrate. In electron beam deposition, an energetic electron
beam is used to melt and evaporate the metal. Sputtering is a vacuum deposition
process that involves bombarding a metal target material with energetic Ar ions,
which dislodges the metal atoms and then condenses them onto a substrate. The
use of sputtering is quite common in microelectronic fabrication. Copper metal
interconnect films used in microelectronics are usually grown by electrodeposition,
that is, using electroplating, an electrochemical process, to deposit the metal film
onto the required chip areas. In many applications, especially in microelectronics,
we are interested in the resistivity of a metal film in which the thickness of the film
or the average size of the grains is comparable to the mean distance between scattering events ℓbulk (the mean free path) in the bulk material. In such cases, the
resistivity of the metal film is greater than the corresponding resistivity of the
bulk crystal. A good example is the resistivity of interconnects and various metal
films used in the “shrinking” world of microelectronics, in which more and more
transistors are packed into a single Si crystal, and various device dimensions are
scaled down.

2.10.2 RESISTIVITY OF THIN FILMS

Polycrystalline Films and Grain Boundary Scattering In a highly polycrystalline sample the conduction electrons are more likely to be scattered by grain
boundaries than by other processes as depicted in Figure 2.33a. Consider the resistivity due to scattering from grain boundaries alone as shown in Figure 2.33b. The
conduction electron is free within a grain, but becomes scattered at the grain boundary. Its mean free path ℓgrain is therefore roughly equal to the average grain size d.

Polycrystalline metal films with a smaller grain diameter d (i.e., more grainy films)

In a more rigorous theory we have to consider a number of effects. It may take
more than one scattering at a grain boundary to totally randomize the velocity, so
we need to calculate the effective mean free path that accounts for how many collisions are needed to randomize the velocity. There is a possibility that the electron
may be totally reflected back at a grain boundary (bounce back). Suppose that the
probability of reflection at a grain boundary is R. Suppose that the probability of
reflection at a grain boundary is R and d is the average grain size (diameter), then
the resistivity can be calculated by the Mayadas–Shatzkes formula

Equation 2.73a implies that the Matthiessen’s rule is reasonably well obeyed
when the grains are larger than the mean free path. For copper, typically R values
are 0.24–0.40, and R is somewhat smaller for Al. Equation 2.72a for a Cu film with
R ≈ 0.3 predicts ρ∕ρcrystal ≈ 1.21 for roughly d ≈ 3λ or a grain size d ≈ 120 nm
since in the bulk crystal λ ≈ 40 nm.

Surface Scattering Consider the scattering of electrons from the surfaces of a

conducting film as in Figure 2.34. Take the film thickness as D. Assume that the
scattering from the surface is inelastic; that is, the electron loses the gained velocity
from the field. Put differently, the direction of the electron after the scattering process
is independent of the direction before the scattering process. This type of scattering
is called nonspecular. (If the electron is elastically reflected from the surface just like
a rubber ball bouncing off a wall, then there is no increase in the resistivity.) It is
unlikely that one surface scattering will completely randomize the electron’s velocity.
The mean free path ℓsurf of the electron will depend on its direction right after the
scattering process as depicted in Figure 2.35. For example, if the angle θ after surface
scattering is zero, (the electron moves transversely to the film length), then ℓsurf = D.
In general, the mean free path ℓsurf will be D∕(cos θ) as illustrated in Figure 2.35.
20
This is obtained by expanding Equation 2.72a about β = 0 to the first term and represents the case with large
grains. However, if we expand it around β = 1, the constant multiplying β is somewhat smaller and would represent
the case where d and λ are comparable as in Example 2.31.

Consider the surface scattering example in Figure 2.35 where the electron is scattered from the bottom surface. If the scattering of the electron were truly random,
then the probability of being scattered in a direction back into the film, that is, in the
+y direction, would be 0.5 on average. However, the electron’s direction right after
the surface scattering is not totally random because we know that the electron cannot
leave the film; thus θ is between −π∕2 and +π∕2 and cannot be between −π and +π.
The electron’s velocity after the first surface scattering must have a y component along
+y and not along −y. The electron can only acquire a velocity component along −y
again after the second surface scattering as shown in Figure 2.35. It therefore takes
two collisions to randomize the velocity, which means that the effective mean free
path must be twice as long, that is 2D∕cos θ. To find the overall mean free path ℓ
for calculating the resistivity we must use Matthiessen’s rule. If λ is the mean free
path of the conduction electrons in the bulk crystal (no surface scattering), then

which is valid down to about D ≈ 0.3λ. Equation 2.76 is in Matthiessen’s rule format,
which means that the second term is the fractional contribution of the surfaces to
the resistivity. It can be seen that for elastic or specular scattering p = 1 and there
is no change in the resistivity. The parameter p is called the specularity parameter.
When p = 0, the scattering at the surface is called diffusive, and represents the case
when the momentum gained from the field is fully lost upon scattering; and the
contribution of surface scattering is maximum. For p = 0, Equation 2.76 predicts
ρ∕ρbulk ≈ 1.20 for roughly D ≈ 1.9λ or a thickness D ≈ 76 nm for Cu for which
λ ≈ 40 nm. The value of p depends on the film preparation method (e.g., sputtering,
epitaxial growth) and the substrate on which the film has been deposited.
21

Specular reflection refers to elastic reflection, that in which there is no energy loss. Such reflections do not
increase the resistivity. (Why?) The actual Fuchs-Sondheimer equation is quite complicated and beyond the
simplified treatment here.

Equation 2.76 involves scattering from two surfaces, that is, from the two interfaces of the film. In general the two interfaces will not be identical and hence will
have different p coefficients; p in Equation 2.76 is some mean p value. Further, if
the surface is rough, that is the surface has significant surface height variation, then
the scattering will be more severe at the surfaces and Equation 2.76 needs to be
modified by factor that represents the roughness of the surface.
Table 2.7 summarizes the resistivity of thin Cu films deposited by various preparation techniques. Notice that the changes in the resistivity with film thickness and
polycrystallinity (grain size) follow, at least qualitatively, the basic models discussed
above. It is generally very difficult to separate the effects of surface and grain boundary scattering in thin polycrystalline films; the contribution from grain boundary
scattering is likely to exceed that from the surfaces. In any event, both contributions,
by Matthiessen’s general rule, increase the overall resistivity. Figure 2.36a shows an
example in which the resistivity ρfilm of thin Cu polycrystalline films is due to grain
boundary scattering, and thickness has no effect (D was 250–900 nm and much
greater than λ). The resistivity ρfilm is plotted against the reciprocal mean grain size
1∕d, which then follows the expected linear behavior in Equation 2.73a. On the other
hand, Figure 2.36b shows the resistivity of Cu films as a function of film thickness
D. The Cu thin films in this case are single crystal layers grown on the (001) surface
of a single crystal of MgO (which is the substrate). As the film is a single crystal,
there is no grain boundary scattering, and the observed increase in the resistivity with
decreasing film thickness is due to the scattering of the electrons from the film surface.
The experiments in Figure 2.36b can be explained by the simplified Fuchs–Sondheimer
equation with an average p = 0.20.

What can you conclude from the plot given that the mean free path λ ≈ 40 nm in Cu?

EXAMPLE 2.30

SOLUTION

Consider the results in Figure 2.36a. According to the figure caption, the film thickness D =
250–900 nm does not affect the resistivity, which implies that ρfilm is controlled only by the
grain size d. The plot of ρfilm versus 1∕d in Figure 2.36a gives a best line that has an intercept
of 17.8 nΩ m and a slope of 600 (nΩ m)(nm). In the Cu crystal, λ ≈ 40 nm but d values in
Figure 2.36a are in the range 44 to 187 nm, larger than λ, so we actually need to use Equation 2.72a to represent the data and hence find β and then R. However, we can carry out a
Taylor expansion22 of Equation 2.72 around β = 1

where p is the average value of p for the top and bottom surfaces of the film. Equation 2.78
is a straight line when ρfilm is plotted against 1∕D. The intercept should be ρcrystal and from
Figure 2.36b (see figure caption), ρcrystal ≈ 17.0 nΩ m, a typical value for a pure Cu crystal.
The slope of the best line is 200 nΩ m nm, so that from Equation 2.78

which gives p ≈ 0.20.
It was assumed that the surface roughness does not modify Equation 2.78. There are
many thin film cases in which one needs to also introduce the effect of surface roughness on
the scattering of electrons, which increases the resistivity above Equation 2.78.

INTERCONNECTS IN MICROELECTRONICS

An integrated circuit (IC) is a single crystal of Si that contains millions of transistors
that have been fabricated within this one crystal. Interconnects are simply metal
conductors that are used to wire the devices together to implement the desired overall operation of the IC. Figure 2.37a illustrates how metal stripes, separated by a
dielectric medium, crisscross inside an integrated circuit to "wire" different semiconductor devices within the silicon wafer. There are many layers of interconnects,
which are separated by dielectric layers made of low-permittivity material. Each
linterconnect layer is called a metalization layer. The vertical connections between
stripes, or connections from interconnects to devices in the silicon crystal, as shown
in Figure 2.37a, are called vias; vertical interconnect access. Figure 2.37b shows a
scanning electron microscope image of an IC with eight levels of metallization.
Aluminum and Al alloys, or Al silicides, have been the workhouse of the interconnects, but today’s fast chips rely on copper interconnects, which have three distinct
advantages. First, copper has a resistivity that is about 40 percent lower than that of
Al. In high-transistor-density chips in which various voltages are switched on and
off, what limits the speed of operation is the RC time constant, that is, the time
constant that is involved in charging and discharging the capacitance between the

interconnects, and the input capacitance of the transistor; usually the former dominates. The RC is substantially reduced with Cu replacing Al so that the chip speed
is faster. The second advantage is that a lower overall interconnect resistance leads
to a lower power consumption, lower I 2R.
The third advantage is that copper has superior resistance to electromigration,
a process in which metal atoms are forced to migrate by a large current density. Such
electromigration can eventually lead to a failure of the interconnect. The current
density in interconnects with a small cross-sectional area can be very high, and hence
the electron drift velocities can also be very high. As these fast electrons collide
with the metal ions there is a momentum transfer that slowly drifts the metal ions.
Thus, the metal ions are forced to slowly migrate as a result of being bombarded by
drifting electrons; the migration is in the direction of electron flow (not current
flow). This atomic migration can deplete or accumulate material in certain local
regions of the interconnect structure. The result is that electromigration can lead to
voids (material depletion) or hillocks (material accumulation), and eventually there
may be a break or a short between interconnects (an interconnect failure). The electromigration effects are reduced in Cu interconnects because the Cu atoms are
heavier and cannot be as easily migrated by an electric current as are Al atoms.
There is a relatively simple expression for estimating the RC time constant of
multilevel interconnects that is useful in comparing various interconnect technologies
and the effects of interconnect metal resistance ρ, the relative permittivity εr of the
interlevel dielectric (insulation) between the interconnects, and the geometry of the
whole interconnect wiring. First consider a simple interconnect line, as in Figure 2.38a,

whose thickness is T, width is W, and length is L. Its resistance R is simply ρL∕(TW).
In the chip, this interconnect will have other interconnects around it as shown in a
highly simplified way in Figure 2.38b. It will couple with all these different conductors
around it and will have an overall (effective) capacitance Ceff. RCeff is what we know
as the RC time constant associated with the interconnect line in Figure 2.38b.
Suppose that the interconnect is an Mth-level metallization. It will have a series
of many “horizontal” neighbors along this Mth level. Let X be the nearest edge-toedge separation and P be the pitch of these horizontal neighbors at the Mth level.
The pitch P refers to the separation from center to center, or the periodicity of
interconnects; P = W + X. At a height H above the interconnect there will be a line
running at the (M + 1) level. Similarly there will be an interconnect line at a distance
H below at the (M − 1) level. We can identify two sets of capacitances. CV represents
the capacitance in the vertical direction, between the interconnect and its upper or
lower neighbor. CH is the lateral capacitance in the horizontal direction, between a
neighbor on the right or left. Both are shown in Figure 2.38c. The interconnect therefore has two CV and two CH, four capacitances in total, and all are in parallel as shown
in Figure 2.38c. From the simple parallel plate capacitance formula we can write

[2.80]

2 .1 1

INTERCONNECTS IN MICROELECTRONICS

Equation 2.80 is only an approximate first-order calculation, but, nonetheless, it
turns out to be quite a useful equation for roughly predicting the RC time constant
and hence the speed of multilevel interconnect based high-transistor-density chips.23
Most significantly, it highlights the importance of three influencing effects: the resistivity of the interconnect metal; relative permittivity εr of the dielectric insulation
between the conductors; and the geometry or “architecture” of the interconnects L,
T, W, X, and H. Notice that L appears as L2 in Equation 2.80 and has significant
control on the overall RC. Equation 2.80 does not obviously include the time it takes
to turn on and off the individual transistors connected to the interconnects. In a
high-transistor-density chip, the latter is smaller than the interconnect RC time constant.
The reduction in the interconnect resistivity ρ by the use of Cu instead of Al
has been a commendable achievement, and cuts down RC significantly. Further
reduction in ρ is limited because Cu already has a very small resistivity; the smallest ρ is for Ag which is only about 5 percent lower. Current research efforts for
reducing RC further are concentrated on mainly two factors. First is the reduction
of εr as much as possible by using dielectrics such as fluorinated SiO2 (known as
FSG) for which εr = 3.6, or, more importantly, using what are called low-k dielectric
materials (k stands for εr) such as various polymers or porous dielectrics24 that
have a lower εr, typically 2–3, which is a substantial reduction from 3.6. The second is the development of optimized interconnect geometries that reduce L2 in Equation 2.80. (T, W, X, and H are all of comparable size, so L2 is the most dominant
geometric factor.)
The ratio of the thickness T to width W of an interconnect is called the aspect
ratio, Ar = T∕W. This ratio is typically between 1 to 2. Very roughly, in many cases,
X and W are the same, X ≈ W and X ≈ P∕2 (see Figure 2.38b). Then Equation 2.80
simplifies further,

RC ≈ 2εoεrρL2( 2 + 2 )
P

[2.81]

The signal delays between the transistors on a chip arise from the interconnect RC
time constant. Equations 2.80 and 2.81 are often also used to calculate the multilevel
interconnect delay time. Suppose that we take some typical values, L ≈ 10 mm,
T ≈ 1 μm, P ≈ 1 μm, ρ = 17 nΩ m for a Cu interconnect, and εr ≈ 3.6 for FSG;
then RC ≈ 0.43 ns, not a negligible value in today’s speed hungry computing.

In a particular high-transistor-density
IC where copper is used as the interconnect, one level of the multilevel interconnects has the

A more rigorous theory would consider the interconnect system as having a distributed resistance and a
distributed capacitance, similar to a transmission line; a topical research area. The treatment here is more than
sufficient to obtain approximate results and understand the factors that control the interconnect delay time.

Since AR = T∕W, W = T∕AR = 0.36∕1.6 = 0.225 μm. Further, from Figure 2.38b, P = W + X,
so that X = P − W = 0.45 − 0.225 = 0.225 μm. H = X = 0.225 μm. Thus, Equation 2.79

ELECTROMIGRATION AND BLACK’S EQUATION

Interconnects have small cross-sectional dimensions, and consequently the current
densities can be quite large. Figure 2.39a depicts how the continual bombardment
of lattice atoms (metal ions) by many “fast” conduction electrons in high-currentdensity regions can transfer enough momentum to a host metal atom to migrate it,
that is, diffuse it along a suitable path in the crystal. The bombarded metal atom has
to jump to a suitable lattice location to migrate, which is usually easiest along grain

boundaries or surfaces where there is sufficient space as depicted in Figure 2.39a
and b. Grain boundaries that are parallel to the electron flow therefore can migrate
atoms more efficiently than grain boundaries in other directions. Atomic diffusion
can also occur along a surface of the interconnect, that is, along an interface between
the interconnect metal and the neighboring material. The final result of atomic
migration is usually either material depletion or accumulation as depicted in Figure
2.39c. The depletion of material leads to a void and a possible eventual break in the
interconnect. The accumulation of material leads to a hillock and a short between
lines. Interconnect failure by electromigration is measured by the mean time to
50 percent failure tMTF. There are two factors that control the rate of electromigration REM. First is the activation energy EA involved in migrating (diffusing) the metal
atom, and the second is the rate at which the atoms are bombarded with electrons,
which depends on the current density J. Thus,
REM ∝ J n exp(−

EA
kT )

[2.82]

in which the rate is proportional to J n, instead of just J because it is found experimentally that n ≥ 1. From the electromigration rate we can find the average time
tMTF it takes for 50 percent failure of interconnects because this time is inversely
proportional to the electromigration rate in Equation 2.82:
tMTF = ABJ

−n

kT

[2.83]

where AB is a constant. Equation 2.83 is known as Black’s equation,25 and it is
extremely useful in extrapolating high-temperature failure tests to normal operating
temperatures. Electromigration-induced interconnect failures are typically examined
at elevated temperatures where the failure times are over a measurable time scale in
the laboratory (perhaps several hours or a few days). These experiments are called
accelerated failure tests because they make use of the fact that at high temperatures
the electromigration failure occurs more quickly. The results are then extrapolated
to room temperature by using Black’s equation.
Typically electromigration occurs along grain boundaries or along various interfaces that the interconnect has with its surroundings, the semiconductor, dielectric
material, etc. The diffusion coefficient has a lower activation energy EA for these
migration paths than for diffusion within the volume of the crystal. The electromigration process therefore depends on the microstructure of the interconnect metal, and
its interfaces. Usually another metal, called a barrier, is deposited to occupy the
interface space between the interconnect and the semiconductor or the oxide. The
barrier passivates the interface, rendering it relatively inactive in terms of providing
an electromigration path. An interconnect can also have a temperature gradient along
it. (The heat generated by I 2R may be conducted away faster at the ends of the interconnect, leaving the central region hotter.) Electromigration would be faster in the hot

activated process. Consequently a pileup of electromigrated atoms can occur as atoms
are migrated from hot to cold regions along the interconnect, leading to a hillock.26
Pure Al suffers badly from electromigration problems and is usually alloyed with
small amounts of Cu, called Al(Cu), to reduce electromigration to a tolerable level. But
the resistivity increases. (Why?) In recent Cu interconnects, the most important diffusion path seems to be the interface between the Cu surface and the dielectric. Surface
coating of these Cu interconnects provides control over electromigration failures.

DEFINING TERMS
Alloy is a metal that contains more than one element.
Brass is a copper-rich Cu–Zn alloy.
Bronze is a copper-rich Cu–Sn alloy.
Drift mobility is the drift velocity per unit applied
field. If μd is the drift mobility, then the defining equation is vd = μdE, where vd is the drift velocity and E is
the field.
Drift velocity is the average electron velocity, over all
the conduction electrons in the conductor, in the direction of an applied electrical force (F = −eE for electrons). In the absence of an applied field, all the
electrons move around randomly, and the average velocity over all the electrons in any direction is zero.
With an applied field Ex, there is a net velocity per
electron vdx, in the direction opposite to the field,

where vdx depends on Ex by virtue of vdx = μdEx, where
μd is the drift mobility.
Electrical conductivity (σ) is a property of a material
that quantifies the ease with which charges flow inside
the material along an applied electric field or a voltage
gradient. The conductivity is the inverse of electrical
resistivity ρ. Since charge flow is caused by a voltage
gradient, σ is the rate of charge flow across a unit area
per unit voltage gradient, J = σE.
Electromigration is current density–induced diffusion
of host metal atoms due to their repeated bombardment
by conduction electrons at high current densities; the
metal atoms migrate in the direction of electron flow.
Black’s equation describes the mean time to failure of
metal film interconnects due to electromigration failure.

DEFINING TERMS
Fourier’s law states that the rate of heat flow Q′
through a sample, due to thermal conduction, is proportional to the temperature gradient dT∕dx and the
cross-sectional area A, that is, Q′ = −κA(dT∕dx), where
κ is the thermal conductivity.
Fuchs-Sondheimer equation describes the resistivity
of a thin metal film in which scattering from the surfaces of the thin film becomes significant or dominant
when the film thickness is comparable or smaller than
the mean free path of electrons in the bulk crystal. The
resistivity increases with decreasing film thickness.
Hall coefficient (RH) is a parameter that gauges the
magnitude of the Hall effect. If Ey is the electric field in
the y direction, due to a current density Jx along x and
a magnetic field Bz along z, then RH = Ey∕JxBz.
Hall effect is a phenomenon that occurs in a conductor carrying a current when the conductor is placed in
a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. The
charge carriers in the conductor are deflected by the
magnetic field, giving rise to an electric field (Hall
field) that is perpendicular to both the current and the
magnetic field. If the current density Jx is along x and
the magnetic field Bz is along z, then the Hall field is
along either +y or −y, depending on the polarity of the
charge carriers in the material.
Heterogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the individual components remain physically separate and
possess different chemical and physical properties; that
is, a mixture of different phases.
Homogeneous mixture is a mixture of two or more
chemical species in which the chemical properties
(e.g., composition) and physical properties (e.g., density, heat capacity) are uniform throughout. A homogeneous mixture is a solution.
Interconnects are various thin metal conductors in a
Si integrated circuit that connect various devices to
implement the required wiring of the devices. In modern ICs, these interconnects are primarily electrodeposited Cu films.
Ionic conduction is the migration of ions in the material as a result of field-directed diffusion. When a positive ion in an interstitial site jumps to a neighboring
interstitial site in the direction of the field, it lowers its
potential energy which is a favorable process. If it

197

jumps in the opposite direction, then it has to do work
against the force of the field which is undesirable. Thus
the diffusion of the positive ion is directed along the
field.
Isomorphous phase diagram is a phase diagram for
an alloy that has unlimited solid solubility.
Joule’s law relates the power dissipated per unit volume
Pvol by a current-carrying conductor to the applied field
E and the current density J, such that Pvol = JE = σE2.
Lorentz force is the force experienced by a moving
charge in a magnetic field. When a charge q is moving
with a velocity v in a magnetic field B, the charge experiences a force F that is proportional to the magnitude of its charge q, its velocity v, and the field B, such
that F = qv × B.
Magnetic field, magnetic flux density, or magnetic
induction (B) is a vector field quantity that describes
the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force exerted on a moving charge or a current-carrying conductor. The magnetic force is essentially the Lorentz force
and excludes the electrostatic force qE.
Magnetic permeability (μ) or simply permeability is
a property of the medium that characterizes the effectiveness of a medium in generating as much magnetic
field as possible for given external currents. It is the
product of the permeability of free space (vacuum) or
absolute permeability (μo) and relative permeability of
the medium (μr), i.e., μ = μo μr.
Magnetometer is an instrument for measuring the
magnitude of a magnetic field.
Matthiessen’s rule gives the overall resistivity of a
metal as the sum of individual resistivities due to scattering from thermal vibrations, impurities, and crystal
defects. If the resistivity due to scattering from thermal
vibrations is denoted ρT and the resistivities due to
scattering from crystal defects and impurities can be
lumped into a single resistivity term called the residual
resistivity ρR, then ρ = ρT + ρR.
Mayadas–Shatzkes formula describes the resistivity
of a thin metal film in which grain boundary scattering
becomes significant or dominant; and the grain size is
comparable or smaller than the mean free path of electrons in the bulk crystal. The resistivity increases with
decreasing grain size.

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

Mean free path is the mean distance traversed by an
electron between scattering events. If τ is the mean free
time between scattering events and u is the mean speed
of the electron, then the mean free path is ℓ = uτ.
Mean free time is the average time it takes to scatter a
conduction electron. If ti is the free time between collisions (between scattering events) for an electron labeled i, then τ = ti averaged over all the electrons. The
drift mobility is related to the mean free time by μd =
eτ∕me. The reciprocal of the mean free time is the
mean probability per unit time that a conduction electron will be scattered; in other words, the mean frequency of scattering events.
Nordheim’s rule states that the resistivity of a solid
solution (an isomorphous alloy) due to impurities ρI is
proportional to the concentrations of the solute X and
the solvent (1 − X).
Phase (in materials science) is a physically homogeneous portion of a materials system that has uniform
physical and chemical characteristics.
Relaxation time is an equivalent term for the mean
free time between scattering events.
Residual resistivity (ρR) is the contribution to the resistivity arising from scattering processes other than
thermal vibrations of the lattice, for example, impurities, grain boundaries, dislocations, point defects.
Skin effect is an electromagnetic phenomenon that, at
high frequencies, restricts ac current flow to near the
surface of a conductor to reduce the energy stored in
the magnetic field.
Solid solution is a crystalline material that is a homogeneous mixture of two or more chemical species. The
mixing occurs at the atomic scale, as in mixing alcohol
and water. Solid solutions can be substitutional (as in
Cu–Ni) or interstitial (for example, C in Fe).

Stefan’s law is a phenomenological description of the
energy radiated (as electromagnetic waves) from a surface per second. When a surface is heated to a temperature T, it radiates net energy at a rate given by Pradiated =
ϵσS A(T 4 − T 04), where σS is Stefan’s constant (5.67 ×
10−8 W m−2 K−4), ϵ is the emissivity of the surface, A
is the surface area, and T0 is the ambient temperature.
Temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) (α0) is
defined as the fractional change in the electrical resistivity of a material per unit increase in the temperature
with respect to some reference temperature T0.
Thermal conductivity (κ) is a property of a material
that quantifies the ease with which heat flows along the
material from higher to lower temperature regions.
Since heat flow is due to a temperature gradient, κ is
the rate of heat flow across a unit area per unit temperature gradient.
Thermal resistance (θ) is a measure of the difficulty
with which heat conduction takes place along a material sample. The thermal resistance is defined as the
temperature drop per unit heat flow, θ = ΔT∕Q′. It depends on both the material and its geometry. If the heat
losses from the surfaces are negligible, then θ = L∕κA,
where L is the length of the sample (along heat flow)
and A is the cross-sectional area.
Thermally activated conductivity means that the
conductivity increases in an exponential fashion with
temperature as in σ = σo exp(−Eσ∕kT ) where Eσ is the
activation energy.
Thin film is a conductor whose thickness is typically
less than ∼1 micron; the thickness is also much less
than the width and length of the conductor. Typically
thin films have a higher resistivity than the corresponding bulk material due to the grain boundary and surface
scattering.

Suppose that n(t) is the concentration of electrons that have not yet collided. The change δn in
the uncollided electron concentration is then −nδt∕τ. Thus, δn = −nδt∕τ, or δn∕n = −δt∕τ. We
can integrate this from n = no at x = 0 to n = n(t) at time t to find the concentration of uncollided

Nordheim’s rule and brass Brass is a Cu–Zn alloy. Table 2.11 shows some typical resistivity
values for various Cu–Zn compositions in which the alloy is a solid solution (up to 30% Zn).
a. Plot ρ versus X(1 − X). From the slope of the best-fit line find the mean (effective) Nordheim
coefficient C for Zn dissolved in Cu over this compositional range.
b. Since X is the atomic fraction of Zn in brass, for each atom in the alloy, there are X Zn atoms
and (1 − X) Cu atoms. The conduction electrons consist of each Zn donating two electrons and
each copper donating one electron.27 Thus, there are 2(X) + 1(1 − X) = 1 + X conduction
electrons per atom. Since the conductivity is proportional to the electron concentration, the
combined Nordheim–Matthiessens rule must be scaled up by (1 + X),

Resistivity of solid solution metal alloys: testing Nordheim’s rule Nordheim’s rule accounts for
the increase in the resistivity resulting from the scattering of electrons from the random distribution
of impurity (solute) atoms in the host (solvent) crystal. It can nonetheless be quite useful in approximately predicting the resistivity at one composition of a solid solution metal alloy, given the value at
another composition. Table 2.12 lists some solid solution metal alloys and gives the resistivity ρ at
one composition X and asks for a prediction ρ′ based on Nordheim’s rule at another composition X′.

NOTE: First symbol (e.g., Ag in AgAu) is the matrix (solvent) and the second (Au) is the added solute. X is in at.%, converted from
traditional weight percentages reported with alloys. Ceff is the effective Nordheim coefficient in ρ = ρo + Ceff X(1 − X).
27

The approach in Question 2.10 is an empirical and a classical way to try and account for the fact that as the
Zn concentration increases, the resistivity does not increase at a rate demanded by the Nordheim equation.
An intuitive correction is then done by increasing the conduction electron concentration with Zn, based on
valency. There is, however, a modern physics explanation that involves not only scattering from the introduction
of impurities (Zn), but also changes in something called the “Fermi surface and density of states at the Fermi
energy”, which can be found in advanced solid state physics textbooks.

Ag–Ni alloys (contact materials) and the mixture rules Silver alloys, particularly Ag alloys with
the precious metals Pt, Pd, Ni, and Au, are extensively used as contact materials in various switches.
Alloying Ag with other metals generally increases the hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance at the expense of electrical and thermal conductivity. For example, Ag–Ni alloys are widely
used as contact materials in switches in domestic appliances, control and selector switches, circuit
breakers, and automotive switches up to several hundred amperes of current. Table 2.15 shows the
resistivities of four Ag–Ni alloys used in make-and-break as well as disconnect contacts with current

ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

2.43

Interconnects Consider a CMOS chip in which the interconnects are copper with a pitch P of
500 nm, interconnect thickness T of 400 nm, aspect ratio 1.4, and H = X. The dielectric is FSG with
εr = 3.6. Consider two cases, L = 1 mm and L = 10 mm, and calculate the overall effective interconnect capacitance Ceff and the RC delay time. Suppose that Al, which is normally Al with about
4 wt.% Cu in the microelectronics industry with a resistivity 31 nΩ m, is used as the interconnect.
What is the corresponding RC delay time?

*2.44

Thin 50 nm interconnects Equation 2.76 is for conduction in a thin film of thickness D and assumes
scattering from two surfaces, which shows that the increase in the resistivity Δρ2 = ρbulk 83 (λ∕D) (1 − p).
An interconnect line in an IC is not quite a thin film and has four surfaces (interfaces), because the
thickness T of the conductor is comparable to the width W. If we assume T = W, we can very roughly
take the resistivity increase with four surfaces as Δρ4 ≈ Δρ2 + Δρ2 ≈ ρbulk 34 (λ∕D) (1 − p) in which
D = T. (The exact expression is more complicated, but the latter will suffice for this problem.) In
addition there will be a contribution from grain boundary scattering so that we need to use Equation
2.90a. For simplicity assume T ≈ W ≈ X ≈ H ≈ 50 nm, λ = 40 nm, p = 0 and εr = 3.6. If the mean
grain size d is roughly 30 nm and R = 0.4, estimate the resistivity of the interconnect and hence the
RC delay for a 0.5 mm interconnect. (You can consider Equation 2.90b but the surface scattering now
is from four surfaces as explained above.)

2.45

Electromigration Although electromigration-induced failure in Cu metallization is less severe
than in Al metallization, it can still lead to interconnect failure depending on current densities and
the operating temperature. In a set of experiments carried out on electroplated Cu metallization
lines, failure of the Cu interconnects have been examined under accelerated tests (at elevated temperatures). The mean lifetime t50 (time for 50 percent of the lines to break) have been measured as
a function of current density J and temperature T at a given current density. The results are summarized in Table 2.23.
a. Plot semilogarithmically t50 versus 1∕T (T in Kelvins) for the first three interconnects. Al(Cu)
and Cu (1.3 × 0.7 μm2) have single activation energies EA. Calculate EA for these interconnects.
Cu (1.3 × 0.7 μm2) exhibits different activation energies for the high-and low-temperature
regions. Estimate these EA.

Elementary Quantum Physics

The triumph of modern physics is the triumph of quantum mechanics. Even the
simplest experimental observation that the resistivity of a metal depends linearly on
the temperature can only be explained by quantum physics, because we must take
the mean speed of the conduction electrons to be nearly independent of temperature.
The modern definitions of voltage and ohm, adopted in January 1990 and now part
of the IEEE standards, are based on Josephson and quantum Hall effects, both of
which are quantum mechanical phenomena.
One of the most important discoveries in physics has been the wave–particle
duality of nature. The electron, which we have so far considered to be a particle and
hence to be obeying Newton’s second law (F = ma), can also exhibit wave-like
properties quite contrary to our intuition. An electron beam can give rise to diffraction patterns and interference fringes, just like a light wave. Interference and diffraction phenomena displayed by light can only be explained by treating light as an
electromagnetic wave. But light can also exhibit particle-like properties in which it
behaves as if it were a stream of discrete entities (“photons”), each carrying a linear
momentum and each interacting discretely with electrons in matter (just like a particle
colliding with another particle).

3.1.1 LIGHT AS A WAVE
In introductory physics courses, light is considered to be a wave. Indeed, such phenomena as interference, diffraction, refraction, and reflection can all be explained
by the theory of waves. In all these phenomena, a ray of light is considered to be
an electromagnetic (EM) wave with a given frequency, as depicted in Figure 3.1.

An electromagnetic wave is a traveling wave with time-varying electric and magnetic fields that

The electric and magnetic fields, Ey and Bz, of this wave are perpendicular to each
other and to the direction of propagation x. The electric field Ey at position x at time

where k is the wavenumber, or the propagation constant, related to the wavelength
λ by k = 2π∕λ, and ω is the angular frequency of the wave (or 2πf, where f is the
frequency). A similar equation describes the variation of the magnetic field Bz
(directed along z) with x at any time t. Equation 3.1 represents a traveling wave in
the x direction, which, in the present example, is a sinusoidally varying function
(Figure 3.1). The velocity of the wave (strictly the phase velocity) is

Understanding the wave nature of light is fundamental to understanding interference and diffraction, two phenomena that we experience with sound waves almost
on a daily basis. Figure 3.2 illustrates how the interference of secondary waves from
the two slits S1 and S2 gives rise to the dark and bright fringes (called Young’s
fringes) on a screen placed at some distance from the slits. At point P on the screen,
the waves emanating from S1 and S2 interfere constructively, if they are in phase.
This is the case if the path difference between the two rays is an integer multiple of
the wavelength λ, or
S1P − S2P = nλ

then the waves interfere destructively and the intensity at point P vanishes. Thus, in
the y direction, the observer sees a pattern of bright and dark fringes.
When X-rays are incident on a crystalline material, they give rise to typical diffraction patterns on a photographic plate, as shown in Figure 3.3a and b, which can
only be explained by using wave concepts. For simplicity, consider two waves, 1 and 2,
in an X-ray beam. The waves are initially in phase, as shown in Figure 3.3c. Suppose

216

CHAPTER 3

that wave 1 is “reflected” from the first plane of atoms in the crystal, whereas wave
2 is “reflected” from the second plane.1 After reflection, wave 2 has traveled an
additional distance equivalent to 2d sin θ before reaching wave 1. The path difference
between the two waves is 2d sin θ, where d is the separation of the atomic planes.
For constructive interference, this must be nλ, where n is an integer. Otherwise,
waves 1 and 2 will interfere destructively and will cancel each other. Waves reflected
from adjacent atomic planes interfere constructively to constitute a diffracted beam
only when the path difference between the waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength, and this will only be the case for certain directions. Therefore, the condition
for the existence of a diffracted beam is
Bragg

condition

2d sin θ = nλ

[3.3]

The condition expressed in Equation 3.3, for observing a diffracted beam, forms
the whole basis for identifying and studying various crystal structures (the science
of crystallography). The equation is referred to as Bragg’s law, and arises from the
constructive interference of waves.
Aside from exhibiting wave-like properties, light can behave like a stream of
“particles” of zero rest-mass. As it turns out, the only way to explain a vast number
of experiments is to view light as a stream of discrete entities or energy packets
called photons, each carrying a quantum of energy hf, and momentum h∕λ, where
h is a universal constant that can be determined experimentally, and f is the frequency
of light. This photonic view of light is drastically different than the simple wave
picture and must be examined closely to understand its origin.

3.1.2 THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
Consider a quartz glass vacuum tube with two metal electrodes, a photocathode and
an anode, which are connected externally to a voltage supply V (variable and reversible) via an ammeter, as schematically illustrated in Figure 3.4. When the cathode
is illuminated with light, if the frequency f of the light is greater than a certain
critical value f 0, the ammeter registers a current I, even when the anode voltage is zero
(i.e., the supply is bypassed). When light strikes the cathode, electrons are emitted
with sufficient kinetic energy to reach the opposite electrode. Applying a positive
voltage to the anode helps to collect more of the electrons and thus increases the
current, until it saturates because all the photoemitted electrons have been collected.
The current, then, is limited by the rate of supply of photoemitted electrons. If, on
the other hand, we apply a negative voltage to the anode, we can “push” back the
photoemitted electrons and hence reduce the current I. Figure 3.5a shows the dependence of the photocurrent on the anode voltage, for one particular frequency of light.
Recall that when an electron traverses a voltage difference V, its potential energy
changes by eV (potential difference is defined as work done per unit charge). When
a negative voltage is applied to the anode, the electron has to do work to get to this
1
Strictly, one must consider the scattering of waves from the electrons in individual atoms (e.g., atoms A and B
in Figure 3.3c) and examine the constructive interference of these scattered waves, which leads to the same
condition as that derived in Equation 3.3.

electrode, and this work comes from its kinetic energy just after photoemission.
When the negative anode voltage V is equal to V0, which just “extinguishes” the
current I, we know that the potential energy “gained” by the electron is just the
kinetic energy lost by the electron, or
1
eV0 = mev 2 = KEm
2

where v is the velocity and KEm is the kinetic energy of the electron just after photoemission. Therefore, we can conveniently measure the maximum kinetic energy
KEm of an emitted electron.
For a given frequency of light, increasing the intensity of light I requires the
same voltage V0 to extinguish the current; that is, the KEm of the emitted electrons
is independent of the light intensity I. This is quite surprising. However, increasing
the intensity does increase the saturation current. Both of these effects are noted in
the I–V results shown in Figure 3.5a.

Since the magnitude of the saturation photocurrent depends on the light intensity I, whereas the KE of the emitted electron is independent of I, we are forced to
conclude that only the number of electrons ejected depends on the light intensity.
Furthermore, if we plot KEm (from the V0 value) against the light frequency f for
different electrode metals for the cathode, we find the typical behavior shown in
Figure 3.6. This shows that the KE of the emitted electron depends on the frequency
of light. The experimental results shown in Figure 3.6 can be summarized by a statement that relates the KEm of the electron to the frequency of light and the electrode
metal, as follows:
KEm = hf − hf0

[3.4]

where h is the slope of the straight line and is independent of the type of metal,
whereas f0 depends on the electrode material for the photocathode (e.g., f01, f02, etc.).
Equation 3.4 is essentially a succinct statement of the experimental observations of
the photoelectric effect as exhibited in Figure 3.6. The constant h is called Planck’s
constant, which, from the slope of the straight lines in Figure 3.6, can be shown to be
about 6.6 × 10−34 J s. This was beautifully demonstrated by Millikan in 1915, in an
excellent series of photoelectric experiments using different photocathode materials.2
The successful interpretation of the photoelectric effect was first given in 1905
by Einstein, who proposed that light consists of “energy packets,” each of which has
the magnitude hf. We can call these energy quanta photons. When one photon strikes
an electron, its energy is transferred to the electron. The whole photon becomes
absorbed by the electron. But, an electron in a metal is in a lower state of potential
energy (PE) than in vacuum, by an amount Φ, which we call the work function of
the metal, as illustrated in Figure 3.7. The lower PE is what keeps the electron in
the metal; otherwise, it would “drop out.”

Figure 3.7 The PE of an electron inside the metal
is lower than outside by an energy called the work
function of the metal.
Work must be done to remove the electron from the
metal.

This lower PE is a result of the Coulombic attraction interaction between the
electron and the positive metal ions. Some of the photon energy hf therefore goes
toward overcoming this PE barrier. The energy that is left (hf − Φ) gives the electron
its KE. The work function Φ changes from one metal to another. Photoemission only
occurs when hf is greater than Φ. This is clearly borne out by experiment, since a
critical frequency f0 is needed to register a photocurrent. When f is less than f0, even
if we use an extremely intense light, no current exists because no photoemission
occurs, as demonstrated by the experimental results in Figure 3.6. Inasmuch as Φ
depends on the metal, so does f0. Therefore, in Einstein’s interpretation hf0 = Φ. In
fact, the measurement of f0 constitutes one method of determining the work function
of a metal.
This explanation for the photoelectric effect is further supported by the fact that
the work function Φ from hf0 is in good agreement with that from thermionic emission experiments.3 There is an apparent similarity between the I–V characteristics of
the phototube and that of the vacuum tube used in early radios. The only difference
is that in the vacuum tube, the emission of electrons from the cathode is achieved
by heating the cathode. Thermal energy ejects some electrons over the PE barrier
Φ. The measurement of Φ by this thermionic emission process agrees with that from
photoemission experiments.
In the photonic interpretation of light, we still have to resolve the meaning of
the intensity of light, because the classical intensity in Equation 3.2 is obviously not
acceptable. Increasing the intensity of illumination in the photoelectric experiment
increases the saturation current, which means that more electrons are emitted per
unit time. We therefore infer that the cathode must be receiving more photons per

3
You can take a quick look into Section 4.9.1 to see that the thermionic emission current in a vacuum tube
depends on the work function Φ of the cathode metal.

3.1.3 COMPTON SCATTERING
When an X-ray strikes an electron, it is deflected, or “scattered.” In addition, the
electron moves away after the interaction, as depicted in Figure 3.9. The wavelength
of the incoming and scattered X-rays can readily be measured. The frequency f ′ of
the scattered X-ray is less than the frequency f of the incoming X-ray. When the KE
of the electron is determined, we find that
KE = hf − hf ′

Since the electron now also has a momentum pe, then from the conservation of
linear momentum law, we are forced to accept that the X-ray also has a momentum.
The Compton scattering experiments show that the momentum of the photon is
related to its wavelength by

the properties of a photon, we must consider its energy and momentum as if it were
a particle.
We should mention that the description of the Compton effect shown in Figure 3.9
is, in fact, the inference from a more practical experiment involving the scattering of
X-rays from a metal target. A collimated monochromatic beam of X-rays of wavelength
λ0 strikes a conducting target, such as graphite, as illustrated in Figure 3.10a. A conducting target contains a large number of nearly “free” electrons (conduction electrons),
which can scatter the X-rays. The scattered X-rays are detected at various angles θ with
respect to the original direction, and their wavelength λ′ is measured. The result of the
experiment is therefore the scattered wavelength λ′ measured at various scattering angles
θ, as shown in Figure 3.10b. It turns out that the λ′ versus θ results agree with the
conservation of linear momentum law applied to an X-ray photon colliding with an
electron with the momentum of the photon given precisely by Equation 3.7.
The photoelectric experiment and the Compton effect are just two convincing
experiments in modern physics that force us to accept that light can have particle-like
properties. We already know that it can also exhibit wave-like properties, in such
experiments as Young’s interference fringes. We are then faced with what is known
as the wave–particle dilemma. How do we know whether light is going to behave
like a wave or a particle? The properties exhibited by light depend very much on
the nature of the experiment. Some experiments will require the wave model, whereas
others may use the particulate interpretation of light. We should perhaps view the
two interpretations as two complementary ways of modeling the behavior of light
when it interacts with matter, accepting the fact that light has a dual nature. Both
models are needed for a full description of the behavior of light.
The expressions for the energy and momentum of the photon, E = hf and p =
h∕λ, can also be written in terms of the angular frequency ω (= 2πf ) and the wave
number k, defined as k = 2π∕λ. If we define ħ = h∕2π, then4

X-RAY PHOTON ENERGY AND MOMENTUM X-rays are photons with very short wavelengths that can penetrate or pass through objects, hence their use in medical imaging, security scans at airports, and many other applications including X-ray diffraction studies of
crystal structures. Typical X-rays used in mammography (medical imaging of breasts) have
a wavelength of about 0.6 angstrom (1 Å = 10−10 m). Calculate the energy and momentum
of an X-ray photon with this wavelength, and the velocity of a corresponding electron that

3.1.4 BLACK BODY RADIATION
Experiments indicate that all objects emit and absorb energy in the form of radiation, and the intensity of this radiation depends on the radiation wavelength and
temperature of the object. This radiation is frequently termed thermal radiation.
When the object is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, that is, at the
same temperature, the object absorbs as much radiation energy as it emits. On the
other hand, when the temperature of the object is above the temperature of its
surroundings, there is a net emission of radiation energy. The maximum amount
of radiation energy that can be emitted by an object is called the black body
radiation. Although, in general, the intensity of the radiated energy depends on
the material’s surface, the radiation emitted from a cavity with a small aperture is
independent of the material of the cavity and corresponds very closely to black
body radiation.
The intensity of the emitted radiation has the spectrum (i.e., intensity vs. wavelength characteristic), and the temperature dependence illustrated in Figure 3.11.
It is useful to define a spectral irradiance Iλ as the emitted radiation intensity
(power per unit area) per unit wavelength, so that Iλ δλ is the intensity in a small
range of wavelengths δλ. Figure 3.11 shows the typical Iλ versus λ behavior of
black body radiation at two temperatures. We assume that the characteristics of
the radiation emerging from the aperture represent those of the radiation within
the cavity.

Classical physics predicts that the acceleration and deceleration of the charges
due to various thermal vibrations, oscillations, or motions of the atoms in the surface
region of the cavity material result in electromagnetic waves of the emissions. These
waves then interfere with each other, giving rise to many types of standing electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths in the cavity. Each wave contributes an
energy kT to the emitted intensity. If we calculate the number of standing waves
within a small range of wavelength, the classical prediction leads to the Rayleigh–
Jeans law in which Iλ ∝ 1∕λ4 and Iλ ∝ T, which are not in agreement with the
experiment, especially in the short-wavelength range (see Figure 3.11).
Max Planck (1900) was able to show that the experimental results can be
explained if we assume that the radiation within the cavity involves the emission
and absorption of discrete amounts of light energy by the oscillation of the molecules of the cavity material. He assumed that oscillating molecules emit and absorb
a quantity of energy that is an integer multiple of a discrete energy quantum that
is determined by the frequency f of the radiation and given by hf. This is what we
now call a photon. He then considered the energy distribution (the statistics) in the
molecular oscillations and took the probability of an oscillator possessing an energy
nhf (where n is an integer) to be proportional to the Boltzmann factor, exp(−nhf∕kT).
He eventually derived the mathematical form of the black body radiation characteristics in Figure 3.11. Planck’s black body radiation formula for Iλ is generally
expressed as
Iλ =

Planck’s

where k is the Boltzmann constant. Planck’s radiation law based on the emission and
absorption of photons is in excellent agreement with all observed black body radiation characteristics as depicted in Figure 3.11.
Planck’s radiation law is undoubtedly one of the major successes of modern
physics. We can take Equation 3.9 one step further and derive Stefan’s black body
radiation law that was used in Chapter 2 to calculate the rate of radiation energy
emitted from the hot filament of a light bulb. If we integrate Iλ over all wavelengths,5
we will obtain the total radiative power PS emitted by a black body per unit surface

The integration of Equation 3.9 can be done by looking up definite integral tables in math handbooks—we

CHAPTER 3

ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS

Equation 3.10 in which PS = σST 4 is Stefan’s law for black body radiation, and the
σS in Equation 3.11 is the Stefan constant with a value of approximately 5.67 ×
10−8 W m−2 K−4. Stefan’s law was known before Planck used quantum physics to
derive his black body radiation law embedded in Iλ. A complete explanation of Stefan’s
law and the value for σS however had to wait for Planck’s law. The h in Equation 3.10
or 3.11 is a clear pointer that the origin of Stefan’s law lies in quantum physics.
EXAMPLE 3.4

Stefan’s law as stated in Equation 3.10 applies to a perfect black body that is emitting radiation into its environment which
is at absolute zero. If the environment or the surroundings of the black body is at a finite
temperature To, than the surroundings would also be emitting radiation. The same black body
will then also absorb radiation from its environment. By definition, a black body is not only
a perfect emitter of radiation but also a perfect absorber of radiation. The rate of radiation
absorbed from the environment per unit surface is again given by Equation 3.10 but with To
instead of T since it is the surroundings that are emitting the radiation. Thus, σST 4o is the
absorbed radiation rate from the surroundings, so

Net rate of radiative power emission per unit surface = σST 4 − σST 4o

Stefan’s law

surface

Further, not all surfaces are perfect black bodies. Black body emission is the maximum possible emission from a surface at a given temperature. A real surface emits less than a black
body. Emissivity ε of a surface measures the efficiency of a surface in terms of a black body
emitter; it is the ratio of the emitted radiation from a real surface to that emitted from a black
body at a given temperature and over the same wavelength range. The total net rate of
radiative power emission becomes
Pradiation = SεσS(T 4 − T 4o)

[3.12]

where S is the surface area that is emitting the radiation. Consider the tungsten filament of
a 100 W incandescent light bulb in a lamp. When we switch the lamp on, the current through
the filament generates heat which quickly heats up the filament to an operating temperature
Tf. At this temperature, the electric energy that is input into the bulb is radiated away from
the filament as radiation energy. A typical 100 W bulb filament has a length of 57.9 cm and
a diameter of 63.5 μm. Its surface area is then
S = π(63.5 × 10−6 m)(0.579 m) = 1.155 × 10−4 m2

The emissivity ε of tungsten is about 0.35. Assuming that under steady-state operation all the
electric power that is input into the bulb’s filament is radiated away,
100 W = Pradiation = SεσS (T 4f − T 4o )
= (1.155 × 10−4 m2 ) (0.35) (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4 ) (T 4f − 3004 )

Solving we find,

Tf = 2570 K

or

2297 °C

which is well below the melting temperature of tungsten which is 3422 °C. The second term
that has T 4o has very little effect on the calculation as radiation absorption from the environment is practically nil compared with the emitted radiation at Tf.
The shift in the spectral intensity emitted from a black body with temperature is of
particular interest to many photoinstrumention engineers. The peak spectral intensity in Figure 3.11 occurs at a wavelength λmax, which, by virtue of Equation 3.9, depends on the

3.2

temperature of the black body. By substituting a new variable x = hc∕(kTλ) into Equation 3.9
and differentiating it, or plotting it against x, we can show that the peak occurs when
λmax T ≈ 2.89 × 10−3 m K

which is known as Wien’s displacement law. The peak emission shifts to lower wavelengths as
the temperature increases. We can calculate the wavelength λmax corresponding to the peak in
the spectral distribution of emitted radiation from our 100 W lamp: λmax = (2.89 × 10−3 m K)∕
(2570 K) = 1.13 μm (in the infrared).

THE ELECTRON AS A WAVE

3.2.1 DE BROGLIE RELATIONSHIP
It is apparent from the photoelectric and Compton effects that light, which we
thought was a wave, can behave as if it were a stream of particulate-like entities
called photons. Can electrons exhibit wave-like properties? Again, this depends on
the experiment and on the energy of the electrons.
When the interference and diffraction experiments in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 are
repeated with an electron beam, very similar results are found to those obtainable
with light and X-rays. When we use an electron beam in Young’s double-slit experiment, we observe high- and low-intensity regions (i.e., Young’s fringes), as illustrated in Figure 3.12. The interference pattern is viewed on a fluorescent TV screen.
When an energetic electron beam hits a polycrystalline aluminum sheet, it produces
diffraction rings on a fluorescent screen as shown in Figures 3.13a and b just like
X-rays do on a photographic plate. When we bring a magnet to the screen, the electrons moving toward the screen experience a force that would bend their paths, which
results in a distorted diffraction pattern as shown in Figure 3.13c. An X-ray diffraction pattern, on the other hand, would be unaffected by a magnetic field. If we

analyze the diffraction pattern obtained with an electron beam, for example Figure 3.13b, we would find that the electrons obey the Bragg diffraction condition
2d sin θ = nλ just as much as the X-ray waves.
Since we know the interatomic spacing d and we can measure the angle of diffraction 2θ, we can readily evaluate the wavelength λ associated with the wave-like
behavior of the electrons. Furthermore, from the accelerating voltage V in the electron tube, we can also determine the momentum of the electrons, because the kinetic
energy gained by the electrons, (p2∕2me), is equal to eV. Simply by adjusting the
accelerating voltage V, we can therefore study how the wavelength of the electron
depends on the momentum.
As a result of such studies and other similar experiments, it has been found that an
electron traveling with a momentum p behaves like a wave of wavelength λ given by

The wavelength is so small that this golf ball will not exhibit any wave

of golf balls.
b. A proton traveling at 2200 m s−1.
Using mp = 1.67 × 10−27 kg, we have λ = (h∕mv) ≈ 0.18 nm. This is only
slightly smaller than the interatomic distance in crystals, so firing protons at a
crystal can result in diffraction. (Recall that to get a diffraction peak, we must
satisfy the Bragg condition, 2d sin θ = nλ.) Protons, however, are charged, so
they can penetrate only a small distance into the crystal. Hence, they are not
used in crystal diffraction studies.
c. Electron accelerated by 100 V.
This voltage accelerates the electron to a KE equal to eV. From KE =
p2∕2me = eV, we can calculate p and hence λ = h∕p. The result is λ = 0.123 nm.
Since this is comparable to typical interatomic distances in solids, we would see
a diffraction pattern when an electron beam strikes a crystal. The actual pattern
is determined by the Bragg diffraction condition.

diameter D1 of the first ring on the fluorescent screen as shown in Table 3.1. What can we
do with such data?
From Figure 3.14a, the kinetic energy KE = p2∕2me gained by an electron in reaching the
anode at V is eV, the decrease in the electrostatic potential energy of the electron. Thus,

When we adjust the anode voltage V, we are actually changing the de Broglie wavelength λ of

expression is indeed correct and find an experimental value for h from electron diffraction experiments. The separation d between the (111) planes in the FCC crystal is6 d = a∕31∕2 where a is
the unit cell lattice parameter, given as 0.4049 nm. The first diffraction ring satisfies the Bragg

Substituting for e, me, and a, we find h = 6.67 × 10−34 J s, which is within about 0.7 percent
of the actual value of h. Further, if we include small relativistic effects,7 experimental h
becomes 6.65 × 10−34 J s. Such electron diffraction experiments, as in this example, clearly
show that the de Broglie relationship λ = h∕p in Equation 3.13 represents the wave-like
behavior of the electron.

3.2.2 TIME-INDEPENDENT SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION
The experiments in which electrons exhibit interference and diffraction phenomena
show quite clearly that, under certain conditions, the electron can behave as a wave;
in other words, it can exhibit wave-like properties. There is a general equation that
describes this wave-like behavior and, with the appropriate potential energy and
boundary conditions, will predict the results of the experiments. The equation is
called the Schrödinger equation and it forms the foundations of quantum theory.
Its fundamental nature is analogous to the classical physics assertion of Newton’s
second law, F = ma, which of course cannot be proved. As a fundamental equation,
Schrödinger’s has been found to successfully predict every observable physical phenomenon at the atomic scale. Without this equation, we will not be able to understand the properties of electronic materials and the principles of operation of many
semiconductor devices. We introduce the equation through an analogy.
A traveling electromagnetic wave resulting from sinusoidal current oscillations,
or the traveling voltage wave on a long transmission line, can generally be described
by a traveling-wave equation of the form
E(x, t) = Eo exp j(kx − ωt) = E(x) exp(−jωt)

[3.19]

7
The momentum of the electron in Equation 3.15 needs a correction term when the electron is traveling fast,
which is due to relativistic effects as discussed in modern physics textbook. An electron with a kinetic energy
KE has a moment p given by p2 = 2meKE + KE2∕c2. The second term is the relativistic effect. In the present
case, the ratio of second to first term is 1 percent.

where E(x) = E0 exp( jkx) represents the spatial dependence, which is separate from
the time variation. We assume that no transients exist to upset this perfect sinusoidal
propagation. We note that the time dependence is harmonic and therefore predictable.
For this reason, in ac circuits we put aside the exp(−jωt) term until we need the
instantaneous magnitude of the voltage.
The average intensity Iav = 12 cεoE2o depends on the square of the amplitude. In
Young’s double-slit experiment, the intensity varies along the y direction, which
means that E2o for the resultant wave depends on y. In the electron version of this
experiment in Figure 3.12, what changes in the y direction is the probability of
observing electrons; that is, there are peaks and troughs in the probability of finding
electrons along y, just like the E2o variation along y. We should therefore attach some
probability interpretation to the wave description of the electron.
In 1926, Max Born suggested a probability wave interpretation for the wave-like
behavior of the electron.
E(x, t) = Eo sin(kx − ωt)

is a plane traveling wavefunction for an electric field; experimentally, we measure
and interpret the intensity of a wave, namely ∣E(x, t)∣2. There may be a similar wave
function for the electron, which we can represent by a function Ψ(x, t). According
to Born, the significance of Ψ(x, t) is that its amplitude squared represents the probability of finding the electron per unit distance. Thus, in three dimensions, if Ψ(x, y,
z, t) represents the wave property of the electron, it must have one of the following
interpretations:
∣Ψ(x, y, z, t)∣2 is the probability of finding the electron per unit volume at
x, y, z at time t.
∣Ψ(x, y, z, t)∣2 dx dy dz is the probability of finding the electron in a small
elemental volume dx dy dz at x, y, z at time t.
If we are just considering one dimension, then the wavefunction is Ψ(x, t), and
∣Ψ(x, t)∣2 dx is the probability of finding the electron between x and (x + dx) at time t.
We should note that since only ∣Ψ∣2 has meaning, not Ψ, the latter function need
not be real; it can be a complex function with real and imaginary parts. For this
reason, we tend to use Ψ* Ψ, where Ψ* is the complex conjugate of Ψ, instead of
∣Ψ∣2, to represent the probability per unit volume.
To obtain the wavefunction Ψ(x, t) for the electron, we need to know how the
electron interacts with its environment. This is embodied in its potential energy function V = V(x, t), because the net force the electron experiences is given by
F = −dV∕dx.

For example, if the electron is attracted by a positive charge (e.g., the proton in a
hydrogen atom), then it clearly has an electrostatic potential energy given by
V(r) = −

e2
4πεor

where r = √x2 + y2 + z2 is the distance between the electron and the proton.

3.2

THE ELECTRON AS A WAVE

233

If the PE of the electron is time independent, which means that V = V(x) in
one dimension, then the spatial and time dependences of Ψ(x, t) can be separated,
just as in Equation 3.19, and the total wavefunction Ψ(x, t) of the electron can be
written as
Ψ (x, t) = ψ(x) exp(−

jEt
ħ)

[3.20]

where ψ (x) is the electron wavefunction that describes only the spatial behavior, and
E is the energy of the electron. The temporal behavior is simply harmonic, by virtue
of exp(−jEt∕ħ), which corresponds to exp(−jωt) with an angular frequency ω = E∕ħ.
The fundamental equation that describes the electron’s behavior by determining ψ (x)
is called the time-independent Schrödinger equation. It is given by the famous
equation
d 2ψ
dx2

+

2me
ħ2

(E − V)ψ = 0

[3.21a]

where me is the mass of the electron.
This is a second-order differential equation. It should be reemphasized that the
potential energy V in Equation 3.21a depends only on x. If the potential energy of
the electron depends on time as well, that is, if V = V(x, t), then in general Ψ(x, t)
cannot be written as ψ (x) exp(−jEt∕ħ). Instead, we must use the full version of the
Schrödinger equation, which is discussed in more advanced textbooks.
In three dimensions, there will be derivatives of ψ with respect to x, y, and z.
We use the calculus notation (∂ψ∕∂x), differentiating ψ(x, y, z) with respect to x but
keeping y and z constant. Similar notations ∂ψ∕∂y and ∂ψ∕∂z are used for derivatives
with respect to y alone and with respect to z alone, respectively. In three dimensions,
Equation 3.21a becomes

(E − V)ψ = 0

[3.21b]

where V = V(x, y, z) and ψ = ψ (x, y, z).
Equation 3.21b is a fundamental equation, called the time-independent Schrödinger
equation, the solution of which gives the steady-state behavior of the electron in a
time-independent potential energy environment described by V = V(x, y, z). By solving Equation 3.21b, we will know the probability distribution and the energy of the
electron. Once ψ (x, y, z) has been determined, the total wavefunction for the electron
is given by Equation 3.20 so that
∣Ψ(x, y, z, t)∣2 = ∣ψ(x, y, z)∣2

which means that the steady-state probability distribution of the electron is simply
∣ψ (x, y, z)∣2.
The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be viewed as a “mathematical
crank.” We input the potential energy of the electron and the boundary conditions,
turn the crank, and get the probability distribution and the energy of the electron
under steady-state conditions.

Two important boundary conditions are often used to solve the Schrödinger
equation. First, as an analogy, when we stretch a string between two fixed points
and put it into a steady-state vibration, there are no discontinuities or kinks along
the string. We can therefore intelligently guess that because ψ (x) represents wave-like
behavior, it must be a smooth function without any discontinuities.
The first boundary condition is that Ψ must be continuous, and the second is that
dΨ∕dx must be continuous. In the steady state, these two conditions translate directly
to ψ and dψ∕dx being continuous. Since the probability of finding the electron is represented by ∣ψ∣2, this function must be single-valued and smooth, without any discontinuities, as illustrated in Figure 3.15. The enforcement of these boundary conditions
results in strict requirements on the wavefunction ψ(x), as a result of which only certain
wavefunctions are acceptable. These wavefunctions are called the eigenfunctions
(characteristic functions) of the system, and they determine the behavior and energy
of the electron under steady-state conditions. The eigenfunctions ψ(x) are also called
stationary states, inasmuch as we are only considering steady-state behavior.
It is important to note that the Schrödinger equation is generally applicable to
all matter, not just the electron. For example, the equation can also be used to
describe the behavior of a proton, if the appropriate potential energy V(x, y, z) and
mass (mproton) are used. Wavefunctions associated with particles are frequently called
matter waves.

3.3

INFINITE POTENTIAL WELL: A CONFINED ELECTRON

The total wavefunction is obtained by multiplying ψ (x) by exp(−jEt∕ħ). We can define
a fictitious frequency for the electron by ω = E∕ħ and multiply ψ(x) by exp(−jωt):
Ψ(x, t) = A exp j(kx − ωt)

or

B exp j(−kx − ωt)

Each of these is a traveling wave. The first solution is a traveling wave in the +x direction, and the second one is in the −x direction. Thus, the free electron has a traveling wave
solution with a wavenumber k = 2π∕λ, that can have any value. The energy E of the electron
is simply KE, so
KE = E =

(ħk) 2
2me

When we compare this with the classical physics expression KE = ( p2∕2me), we see that
the momentum is given by
p = ħk

or

p=

h
λ

This is the de Broglie relationship. The latter therefore results naturally from the
Schrödinger equation for a free electron.
The probability distribution for the electron is
∣ψ(x)∣2 = ∣A exp j(kx)∣2 = A2

which is constant over the entire space. Thus, the electron can be anywhere between x = −∞
and x = +∞. The uncertainty Δx in its position is infinite. Since the electron has a welldefined wavenumber k, its momentum p is also well-defined by virtue of p = ħk. The uncertainty Δp in its momentum is thus zero.

3.3

INFINITE POTENTIAL WELL:
A CONFINED ELECTRON

Consider the behavior of the electron when it is confined to a certain region, 0 < x < a.
Its PE is zero inside that region and infinite outside, as shown in Figure 3.16. The
electron cannot escape, because it would need an infinite PE. Clearly the probability
∣ψ ∣2 of finding the electron per unit volume is zero outside 0 < x < a. Thus, ψ = 0
when x ≤ 0 and x ≥ a, and ψ is determined by the Schrödinger equation in 0 < x < a
with V = 0. Therefore, in the region 0 < x < a

This is a second-order linear differential equation. As a general solution, we

[3.23]

where k is some constant (to be determined) and substitute this in Equation 3.22 to
find k. We first note that ψ (0) = 0; therefore, B = −A so that
ψ(x) = A[exp( jkx) − exp(−jkx)] = 2Aj sin kx

which can be rearranged to obtain the energy of the electron:

INFINITE POTENTIAL WELL: A CONFINED ELECTRON

237

where px is its momentum. Comparing this with Equation 3.25, we see that the
momentum of the electron must be
px = ±ħk

[3.26]

The momentum px may be in the +x direction or the −x direction (which is the
reason for ±), so the average momentum is actually zero, pav = 0.
We have already seen this relationship, when we defined k as 2π∕λ (wavenumber)
for a free traveling wave. So the constant k here is a wavenumber-type quantity even
though there is no distinct traveling wave. Its value is determined by the boundary
condition at x = a where ψ = 0, or
ψ(a) = 2Aj sin ka = 0

The solution to ka = 0 is simply ka = nπ, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is an integer.
We exclude n = 0 because it will result in ψ = 0 everywhere (no electron at all).
We notice immediately that k, and therefore the energy of the electron, can only
have certain values; they are quantized by virtue of n being an integer. Here, n is
called a quantum number. For each n, there is a special wavefunction
ψn (x) = 2Aj sin(

nπx
a )

[3.27]

which is called an eigenfunction.8 All ψn for n = 1, 2, 3 . . . constitute the eigenfunctions of the system. Each eigenfunction identifies a possible state for the electron.
For each n, there is one special k value, kn = nπ∕a, and hence a special energy value

En =

[3.28]

The energies En defined by Equation 3.28 with n = 1, 2, 3 . . . are called eigenenergies
of the system.
We still have not completely solved the problem, because A has yet to be determined. To find A, we use what is called the normalization condition. The total
probability of finding the electron in the whole region 0 < x < a is unity, because
we know the electron is somewhere in this region. Thus, ∣ψ ∣2 dx summed between
x = 0 and x = a must be unity, or

[3.29]

We can now summarize the behavior of an electron in a one-dimensional PE
well. Its wavefunction and energy, shown in Figure 3.16, are given by Equations 3.29
and 3.28, respectively. Both depend on the quantum number n. The energy of the
electron increases with n2, so the minimum energy of the electron corresponds to
n = 1. This is called the ground state, and the energy of the ground state is the
lowest energy the electron can possess. Note also that the energy of the electron in
this potential well cannot be zero, even though the PE is zero. Thus, the electron
always has KE, even when it is in the ground state.
The node of a wavefunction is defined as the point where ψ = 0 inside the well.
It is apparent from Figure 3.16 that the ground wavefunction ψ1 with the lowest
energy has no nodes, ψ2 has one node, ψ3 has two nodes, and so on. Thus, the energy
increases as the number of nodes increases in a wavefunction.
It may seem surprising that the energy of the electron is quantized; that is, it
can only have finite values, given by Equation 3.28. The electron cannot be made
to take on any value of energy, as in the classical case. If the electron behaved like
a classical particle, then an applied force F could impart any value of energy to it,
because F = dp∕dt (Newton’s second law), or p = ∫ F dt. By applying a force F for
a time t, we can give the electron a KE of

However, Equation 3.28 tells us that, in the microscopic world, the energy can only
have quantized values. The two conflicting views can be reconciled if we consider
the energy difference between two consecutive energy levels, as follows:
ΔE = En+1 − En =

h2 (2n + 1)
8mea2

[3.30]

As a increases to macroscopic dimensions, a → ∞, the electron is completely
free and ΔE → 0. Since ΔE = 0, the energy of a completely free electron (a = ∞)
is continuous. The energy of a confined electron, however, is quantized, and ΔE
depends on the dimension (or size) of the potential well confining the electron.
In general, an electron will be “contained” in a spatial region of three dimensions, within which the PE will be lower (hence the confinement). We must then
solve the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions. The result is three quantum
numbers that characterize the behavior of the electron.
Examination of the wavefunctions ψn in Figure 3.16 shows that these are either
symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the center of the well at x = 21a. The

3.3

INFINITE POTENTIAL WELL: A CONFINED ELECTRON

239

symmetry of a wavefunction is called its parity. Whenever the potential energy
function V(x) exhibits symmetry about a certain point C, for example, about x = 12a in
Figure 3.16, then the wavefunctions have either even parity (such as ψ1, ψ3, . . . that
are symmetric) or have odd parity (such as ψ2, ψ4, . . . that are antisymmetric) with
respect to C.
An electron in an infinite PE well would normally occupy the lowest state that
corresponds to ψ1 with an energy E1. The next possible state is ψ2 at an energy E2.
The electron in the ground state at E1 can be excited to E2 by the absorption of a
photon of exactly the energy E2 − E1, which corresponds to a radiation frequency
f12 such that hf12 = E2 − E1. An electromagnetic radiation that is incident on the
quantum well and has the right frequency f12 will be absorbed by the electron at E1,
which will be excited to the energy level E2. In this particular case, as apparent from
Figure 3.16, the excitation of the electron by the absorption of a photon from ψ1 to
ψ2 involves a change in the parity of the wavefunction, from even to odd. This
observation turns out to be generally true. Whenever an electron in a quantum well
absorbs or emits electromagnetic radiation, its parity must change. Those transitions
in which the parity does not change have a low probability (but not zero) of occurrence and are usually called forbidden transitions.9 For example, suppose the electron
is in a state ψ3 at an energy level E3. It can emit a photon and decay down from E3
to E2 or E1. It will transit down to E2 because the parity of its wavefunction will
change, and this transition has a much higher probability. The transition from ψ3 to
ψ1 is “forbidden” and the probability of its occurrence is low. From E2, the electron
will decay down to E1.

ELECTRON CONFINED WITHIN ATOMIC DIMENSIONS Consider an electron in an infinite

potential well of size 0.1 nm (typical size of an atom). What is the ground energy of the
electron? What is the energy required to put the electron at the second energy level? How
can this energy be provided?

SOLUTION

The electron is confined in an infinite potential well, so its energy is given by
En =

We use n = 1 for the ground level and a = 0.1 nm. Therefore,
E1 =

ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS

The second energy level E2 is
E2 = E1n2 = (37.6 eV)(2)2 = 150.4 eV

The energy required to take the electron from 37.6 eV to 150.4 eV is 112.8 eV. This can be
provided by a photon of exactly that energy; no less, and no more. Since the photon energy
is E = hf = hc∕λ, or

quantum number n be if the object is moving with a speed 1 m s−1? What is the separation
of the energy levels of the object moving with that speed?
ENERGY OF AN APPLE IN A CRATE

SOLUTION

Since the object is within rigid walls, we take the PE outside the walls as infinite and use
En =

h2n2
8ma2

to find the ground-level energy. With n = 1, a = 1 m, m = 0.1 kg, we have
E1 =

8(0.1 kg) (1 m) 2

= 5.45 × 10−67 J = 3.4 × 10−48 eV

This speed cannot be measured by any instrument; therefore, for all practical purposes, the
apple is at rest in the crate (a relief for the fruit grocer). The time required for the object to
move a distance of 1 mm is 3 × 1029 s or 1021 years, which is more than the present age of
the universe!

This energy separation is not detectable by any instrument. So for all practical purposes, the
energy of the object changes continuously.
We see from this example that in the limit of large quantum numbers, quantum predictions
agree with the classical results. This is the essence of Bohr’s correspondence principle.

3.4

HEISENBERG’S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE

The wavefunction of a free electron corresponds to a traveling wave with a single
wavelength λ, as shown in Example 3.6. The traveling wave extends over all space,
along all x, with the same amplitude, so the probability distribution function is uniform throughout the whole of space. The uncertainty Δx in the position of the
electron is therefore infinite. Yet, the uncertainty Δpx in the momentum of the electron is zero, because λ is well-defined, which means that we know px exactly from
the de Broglie relationship, px = h∕λ.
For an electron trapped in a one-dimensional infinite PE well, the wavefunction
extends from x = 0 to x = a, so the uncertainty in the position of the electron is a. We
know that the electron is within the well, but we cannot pinpoint with certainty exactly
where it is. The momentum of the electron is either px = ħk in the +x direction or −ħk
in the −x direction. The uncertainty Δpx in the momentum is therefore 2ħk; that is,
Δpx = 2ħk. For the ground-state wavefunction, which corresponds to n = 1, we have
ka = π. Thus, Δpx = 2ħπ∕a. Taking the product of the uncertainties in x and p, we get
(Δx)(Δpx ) = (a) (

Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) received the Nobel prize in
physics in 1932 for the uncertainty principle. This photo was
apparently taken in 1936, while he was lecturing on quantum
mechanics. “An expert is someone who knows some of the
worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to

CHAPTER 3

ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS

In other words, the product of the position and momentum uncertainties is simply h. This relationship is fundamental; and it constitutes a limit to our knowledge
of the behavior of a system. We cannot exactly and simultaneously know both the
position and momentum of a particle along a given coordinate. In general, if Δx and
Δpx are the respective uncertainties in the simultaneous measurement of the position
and momentum of a particle along a particular coordinate (such as x), the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle states that10
Δx Δpx ≳ ħ

[3.31]

We are therefore forced to conclude that as previously stated, because of the
wave nature of quantum mechanics, we are unable to determine exactly and simultaneously the position and momentum of a particle along a given coordinate. There
will be an uncertainty Δx in the position and an uncertainty Δpx in the momentum
of the particle and these uncertainties will be related by Heisenberg’s uncertainty
relationship in Equation 3.31.
These uncertainties are not in any way a consequence of the accuracy of a measurement or the precision of an instrument. Rather, they are the theoretical limits to
what we can determine about a system. They are part of the quantum nature of the
universe. In other words, even if we build the most perfectly engineered instrument
to measure the position and momentum of a particle at one instant, we will still be
faced with position and momentum uncertainties Δx and Δpx such that Δx Δpx > ħ.
There is a similar uncertainty relationship between the uncertainty ΔE in the
energy E (or angular frequency ω) of the particle and the time duration Δt during
which it possesses the energy (or during which its energy is measured). We know that
the kx part of the wave leads to the uncertainty relation Δx Δpx > ħ or Δx Δk ≥ 1.
By analogy we should expect a similar relationship for the ωt part, or Δω Δt ≥ 1.
This hypothesis is true, and since E = ħω, we have the uncertainty relation for the
particle energy and time:
ΔE Δt ≳ ħ

[3.32]

Note that the uncertainty relationships in Equations 3.31 and 3.32 have been
written in terms of ħ, rather than h, as implied by the electron in an infinite potential
energy well (Δx Δpx ≥ h). In general, there is also a numerical factor of 12 multiplying ħ in Equations 3.31 and 3.32 which comes about when we consider a Gaussian
spread for all possible position and momentum values. The proof is not presented
here, but can be found in advanced quantum mechanics books.
It is important to note that the uncertainty relationship applies only when the
position and momentum are measured in the same direction (such as the x direction). On the other hand, the exact momentum, along, say, the y direction and the
exact position, along, say, the x direction can be determined exactly, since Δx Δpy
need not satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship (in other words, Δx Δpy
can be zero).

10

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is normally written in terms of ħ rather than h. Further, in some physics
texts, ħ in Equation 3.31 has a factor 21 multiplying it.

1000 Hz (or cycles/s). Suppose we can only measure the number of cycles to an accuracy of
1 cycle, because we need to receive a whole cycle to record it as one complete cycle. Then,
in a time interval of Δt = 1 s, we will register 1000 ± 1 cycles. The uncertainty Δf in the
frequency is 1 cycle/1 s or 1 Hz. If Δt is 2 s, we will measure 2000 ± 1 cycles, and the
uncertainty Δf will be 1 cycle/2 s or 12 cycle/s or 12 Hz. Thus, Δf decreases with Δt.
Suppose that in a time interval Δt, we measure N ± 1 cycles. Since the uncertainty is
1 cycle in a time interval Δt, the uncertainty in f will be

In quantum mechanics, under steady-state conditions, an object has a time-oscillating wavefunction with a frequency ω which is related to its energy E by ω = E∕ħ (see Equation 3.20).
Substituting this into the previous relationship gives
ΔE Δt = h

The uncertainty in the energy of a quantum object is therefore related, in a fundamental
way, to the time duration during which the energy is observed. Notice that we again have h,
as for Δx Δpx = h, though the quantum mechanical uncertainty relationship in Equation 3.32
has ħ.

When the electron is contained in a finite PE well as shown in Figure 3.17a, due to
the confinement, the electron energy is again quantized but the energy values are
not given by the simple expression in Equation 3.28 for an infinite PE well. For the
infinite well, the electron wavefunction ψ (x) abruptly terminates at x = 0 and x = a
as in Figure 3.16; ψ(x) = 0 outside the well. This may seem contrary to the boundary

condition that dψ∕dx should be continuous (see Figure 3.15). However, the infinite
PE well is an exceptional case because V = ∞ means that only ψ = 0 outside the
well can satisfy the Schrödinger equation.
We can divide the problem into three regions I, II, and III as shown in Figure
3.17a. In region II, inside the well V = 0, and we define k as before

The general solutions to Equation 3.34 is

where B1 and B2 are the integration constants we need to find from boundary conditions.
In I and III, the PE is finite and V = Vo for x ≤ a and x ≥ a. We define
α2 =

[3.36]

which depends on Vo; and hence α is a characteristic parameter for the finite well.

Notice that the second term has the opposite sign to Equation 3.34. The general

ψIII(x) = C1exp(αx) + C2exp(−αx)

[3.38b]

where As and Cs are integration constants.
We are looking for electron energies inside the well, that is, E < Vo, which means
α is positive. Each of Equations 3.35 and 3.38a, and 3.38b has two constants that we
need to find through boundary conditions and requirements on the wavefunction. In
the present case, ψ (x) cannot be zero at the boundaries, ψ (x) exists both inside and
outside the well, and it must be continuous, single valued and have a continuous
slope, that is dψ∕dx must be continuous. (See Figure 3.15.) Further, the normalization requirement means that if we integrate ∣ψ (x)∣2 over all space, it should be 1,
so that A2 and C1 must be zero; otherwise C1exp(αx) would increase to infinity as
x → +∞ and similarly so would A2exp(−αx) as x → −∞.
Figure 3.17b and c show the wavefunctions and the energies of the electron
derived by continuing the mathematical steps above further. Within the well, we have

It is easy to show that while we need an exp(± jkx) type of solution for Equation 3.34, for Equation 3.37, which
has the opposite sign, the solution cannot have the j, and must be of the form exp(±αx).

harmonic-type solutions somewhat similar to before but ψ is not zero at the boundaries. The potential energy V(x) is symmetric about x = a∕2, which means that the
wavefunctions must be either even or odd parity as in Figure 3.17. Outside the well,
ψ decreases exponentially as we move away from the well. The waveforms in I, II,
and III need to be joined smoothly and provide the overall wavefunction. The energy
E of the electron is quantized because only certain energies give the right k and α
for the wavefunctions in Equations 3.35 and 3.38a and b to satisfy the Schrödinger
Equations 3.34 and 3.37. In addition, not all solutions exist inasmuch as if we were
to impart sufficient energy to the electron such that E > Vo, the electron would
become free. The number of solutions and the energy values depend on the width a
and depth of the well, Vo. The example in Figure 3.17a has only three solutions with
the three wavefunctions ψ1, ψ2, and ψ3 shown in Figure 3.17b. Notice that the wavefunctions penetrate into the barriers as exponentially decaying functions. For example, in region III, the wavefunction ψIII ∝ exp[−α(x−a)]. The quantity 1∕α is a
measure of the extent of penetration of the electron into the barrier, and is called
the penetration depth.
As a simple example, consider a finite well that has a width of 2 nm and a PE
barrier Vo of 0.50 eV as shown in Figure 3.17c. If this were an infinite PE well, the
first three levels would be 0.094 eV, 0.38 eV and 0.85 eV. For this finite PE well,
only three solutions exist that correspond to E1 = 0.057 eV, E2 = 0.22 eV, and
E3 = 0.45 eV. Notice that the energies are significantly different and lower (Why?).12
Finite PE wells play an important role in confining charge carriers in today’s optoelectronic devices as we will see in Chapter 6. One particular optoelectronic application
is Terahertz emitters. Electrons are injected into the well and they move from one level
to the next, for example from E3 to E2. By choosing the width a and the height Vo, the
emitted radiation from E3 to E2 or E2 to E1 can be made to be in the terahertz range.
EXAMPLE 3.12

FINITE QUANTUM WELL Consider a finite one-dimensional potential energy well. The
width a is 2 nm and the height of the barrier is 0.5 eV. There are only three energy levels
E1 = 0.057 eV, E2 = 0.22 eV, and E3 = 0.45 eV. Find the penetration depth into the barrier
for the corresponding wavefunctions.
SOLUTION

The wavefunction in the barrier decays exponentially in which the decay constant is α, given
by Equation 3.36. Thus, for the first energy level E1

so that the penetration depth δ1 = 1∕α1 is 0.29 nm. Repeating the above calculation for
E2 and E3, we find δ2 = 1∕α2 is 0.37 nm and δ3 = 1∕α3 is 0.87 nm. Notice that for the
E3-wavefunction, the penetration is extensive as in Figure 3.17b.
12

With the wavefunction extending further into the barriers, the uncertainty Δx in the position of the electron is
now larger than that in the infinite PE well. From the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, this corresponds to a
smaller uncertainty in the momentum, which implies a smaller energy.

3.5

CONFINED ELECTRON IN A FINITE POTENTIAL ENERGY WELL

Figure 3.17b shows three of the
allowed wavefunctions ψ1(x), ψ2(x), and ψ3(x) for the finite potential well. We know that there
is a center of symmetry at x = a∕2. Thus, ψ(x) must reflect this symmetry and must be either
even or odd functions. Therefore, in region II in Figure 3.17a, we have two types of possible
solutions corresponding to cosine (even) and sine (odd) functions about the center of symmetry as in Figure 3.17b. Consider the cosine function

EXAMPLE 3.13

ψII (x) = A cos k(x − a)

where A is a constant. This satisfies the Schrödinger equation in region II. Further, in region III,
the wavefunction decays with distance and we can write it simply as ψ III(x) = C2exp(−αx) =
C3exp[−α(x − a)], where C3 is a new constant. We now apply the boundary conditions that
at x = a, ψ II(a) = ψ III(a), and dψ II∕dx = dψ III∕dx. Clearly, these are
1
A cos k(a − a) = C3 exp[−α(a − a) ]

and

Dividing the right equation by the left, we obtain
1
α = k tan( ka)
2

[3.39]

Now, both k and α depend on the energy through Equations 3.33 and 3.36. Thus, Equation 3.39 is an equation for the energy of the electron. Only certain energy values can satisfy
Equation 3.39, which means that the energy is quantized. If we were to use the odd wavefunction, ψII(x) = B sin k(x − 12 a), we would find α = −k cot( 12 ka) whose solutions would also
be quantized energies. Both equations are normally used in finding the electron energies in
a quantum well because we need to consider all possible wavefunctions.
For a quantum well that has a = 2 nm, and Vo = 0.5 eV, the solution of Equation 3.39
is obtained graphically by plotting the left and right hand sides, that is, α and ktan(ka∕2)
as a function of energy E as shown in Figure 3.18. The intersection point represents the
solution, which is E1 = 0.57 eV. The second level E2 is found from the intersection of α and
−kcot(ka∕2) versus E plots, which is E2 = 0.22 eV, as also shown in Figure 3.18. There are
only three solutions and the energies are quantized.

TUNNELING PHENOMENON: QUANTUM LEAK

To understand the tunneling phenomenon, let us examine the thrilling events experienced by the roller coaster shown in Figure 3.19a. Consider what the roller coaster
can do when released from rest at a height A. The conservation of energy means
that the carriage can reach B and at most C, but certainly not beyond C and definitely
not D and E. Classically, there is no possible way the carriage will reach E at the
other side of the potential barrier D. An extra energy corresponding to the height
difference, D − A, is needed. Anyone standing at E will be quite safe. Ignoring
frictional losses, the roller coaster will go back and forth between A and C.
Now, consider an analogous event on an atomic scale. An electron moves with
an energy E in a region x < 0 where the potential energy PE is zero; therefore, E
is solely kinetic energy. The electron then encounters a potential barrier of “height”
Vo, which is greater than E at x = 0. The extent (width) of the potential barrier is
a. On the other side of the potential barrier, x > a, the PE is again zero as shown
in Figure 3.19b. What will the electron do? Classically, just like the roller coaster,
the electron should bounce back and thus be confined to the region x < 0, because
its total energy E is less than Vo. In the quantum world, however, there is a distinct
possibility that the electron will “tunnel” through the potential barrier and appear
on the other side; it will leak through.
To show this, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for the present choice
of V(x). Remember that the only way the Schrödinger equation will have the solution
ψ (x) = 0 is if the PE is infinite, that is, V = ∞. Therefore, within any zero or finite
PE region, there will always be a solution ψ (x) and there always will be some probability of finding the electron.

Figure 3.19 (a) The roller coaster
released from A can at most make it
to C, but not to E. Its PE at A is less than
the PE at D. When the car is at the
bottom, its energy is totally KE. CD is
the energy barrier that prevents the car
from making it to E. In quantum theory,
on the other hand, there is a chance
that the car could tunnel (leak) through
the potential energy barrier between C
and E and emerge on the other side of
the hill at E. (b) The wavefunction for the
electron incident on a potential energy

We can divide the electron’s space into three regions, I, II, and III, as indicated
in Figure 3.19b. We can then solve the Schrödinger equation for each region, to
obtain three wavefunctions ψ I(x), ψ II(x), and ψ III(x). In regions I and III, ψ (x) must
be traveling waves, as there is no PE (the electron is free and moving with a kinetic
energy E). In zone II, however, E − Vo is negative, so the general solution of the
Schrödinger equation is the sum of an exponentially decaying function and an exponentially increasing function. In other words,
ψ I(x) = A1 exp( jkx) + A2 exp(−jkx)

[3.40a]

ψ II(x) = B1 exp(αx) + B2 exp(−αx)

[3.40b]

ψ III(x) = C1 exp( jkx) + C2 exp(−jkx)

[3.40c]

are the wavefunctions in which
k2 =

2meE

[3.41]

ħ2

and
2me (Vo − E)

α2 =

[3.42]

Equation 3.41 follows from substituting ψ I(x) and ψ III(x) into the Schrödinger
equation in regions I and III, respectively. Equation 3.42 for α2 follows from substituting ψ II(x) into the Schrödinger equation in region II. Both k2 and α2, and hence k
and α, in Equations 3.40a to c are positive numbers. This means that exp( jkx) and
exp(−jkx) represent traveling waves in opposite directions, and exp(−αx) and exp(αx)
represent an exponential decay and rise, respectively. We see that in region I, ψ I(x)
consists of the incident wave A1 exp( jkx) in the +x direction, and a reflected wave
A2 exp(−jkx), in the −x direction. Furthermore, because the electron is traveling
toward the right in region III, there is no reflected wave, so C2 = 0.
We must now apply the boundary conditions and the normalization condition to
determine the various constants A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1. In other words, we must match
the three waveforms in Equations 3.40a to c at their boundaries (x = 0 and x = a)
so that they form a continuous single-valued wavefunction. With the boundary conditions enforced onto the wavefunctions ψ I(x), ψ II(x), and ψ III(x), all the constants can
be determined in terms of the amplitude A1 of the incoming wave. The relative
probability that the electron will tunnel from region I through II to III is defined as
the transmission coefficient T, and this depends very strongly on both the relative
PE barrier height (Vo − E) and the width a of the barrier. The final result that comes
out from a tedious application of the boundary conditions is

and α is the rate of decay of ψII(x) as expressed in Equation 3.42. For a wide or high
barrier, using αa ≫ 1 in Equation 3.43 and sinh(αa) ≈ 12 exp(αa), we can deduce
T = To exp(−2αa)

[3.45]

where
To =

16E(Vo − E)

[3.46]

By contrast, the relative probability of reflection is determined by the ratio of
the square of the amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave. This
quantity is the reflection coefficient R, which is given by

[3.47]

We can now summarize the entire tunneling affair as follows. When an electron encounters a potential energy barrier of height Vo greater than its energy E,
there is a finite probability that it will leak through that barrier. This probability depends sensitively on the energy and width of the barrier. For a wide potential barrier, the probability of tunneling is proportional to exp(−2αa), as in
Equation 3.45. The wider or higher the potential barrier, the smaller the chance
of the electron tunneling.
One of the most remarkable technological uses of the tunneling effect is in the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which elegantly maps out the surfaces of
solids. A conducting probe is brought so close to the surface of a solid that electrons
can tunnel from the surface of the solid to the probe, as illustrated in Figure 3.20.
When the probe is far removed, the wavefunction of an electron decays exponentially
outside the material, by virtue of the potential energy barrier being finite (the work
function is ∼10 eV). When the probe is brought very close to the surface, the wavefunction penetrates into the probe and, as a result, the electron can tunnel from the
material into the probe. Without an applied voltage, there will be as many electrons
tunneling from the material to the probe as there are going in the opposite direction
from the probe to the material, so the net current will be zero.
On the other hand, if a positive bias is applied to the probe with respect to the
material, as shown in Figure 3.20, an electron tunneling from the material to the probe
will see a lower potential barrier than one tunneling from the probe to the material.
Consequently, there will be a net current from the probe to the material and this
current will depend very sensitively on the separation a of the probe from the surface,
by virtue of Equation 3.45.
Because the tunneling current is extremely sensitive to the width of the potential
barrier, the tunneling current is essentially dominated by electrons tunneling to the
probe atom nearest to the surface. Thus, the probe tip has an atomic dimension. By
scanning the surface of the material with the probe and recording the tunneling current the user can map out the surface topology of the material with a resolution

reason is that the exact electron concentration on the surface is also influenced by
the second layer of atoms underneath the top layer. The overall effect makes the

TUNNELING PHENOMENON: QUANTUM LEAK

Consider two copper wires separated only by their surface oxide layer (CuO). Classically, since the oxide layer
is an insulator, no current should be possible through the two copper wires. Suppose that for
the conduction (“free”) electrons in copper, the surface oxide layer looks like a square potential energy barrier of height 10 eV. Consider an oxide layer thickness of 5 nm and evaluate
the transmission coefficient for conduction electrons in copper, which have a kinetic energy
of about 7 eV. What will be the transmission coefficient if the oxide barrier is 1 nm?

so that
αa = (8.9 × 109 m−1)(5 × 10−9 m) = 44.50

Since this is greater than unity, we use the wide-barrier transmission coefficient in Equation 3.45.
Now,

With a = 1 nm,
T = 3.36 exp[−2(8.9 × 109 m−1)(1 × 10−9 m)]
= 3.36 exp(−17.8) ≈ 6.2 × 10−8

Notice that reducing the layer thickness by five times increases the transmission probability
by 1031! Small changes in the barrier width lead to enormous changes in the transmission
probability. We should note that when a voltage is applied across the two wires, the potential
energy height is altered (PE = charge × voltage), which results in a large increase in the
transmission probability and hence results in a current.

SOLUTION

The total energy of the carriage at height A is
E = PE = mg(height) = (100 kg)(10 m s−2)(10 m) = 104 J

Suppose that as a first approximation, we can approximate the hump as a square hill of
height 15 m and width 10 m. The PE required to reach the peak would be
Vo = mg(height) = (100 kg)(10 m s−2)(15 m) = 1.5 × 104 J

From Equation 3.42,
α2 =

and so
α = 9.52 × 1036 m−1

With a = 10 m, we have αa ≫ 1, so we can use the wide-barrier tunneling equation,
T = To exp(−2αa)

where
To =

16[E(Vo − E) ]
V2o

= 3.56

Thus,
T = 3.56 exp[−2(9.52 × 1036 m−1)(10 m)] = 3.56 exp(−1.9 × 1038)

POTENTIAL BOX: THREE QUANTUM NUMBERS

To examine the properties of a particle confined to a region of space, we take a
three-dimensional space with a volume marked by a, b, c along the x, y, z axes. The
PE is zero (V = 0) inside the space and is infinite on the outside, as illustrated in

try to solve this by separating the variables via ψ (x, y, z) = ψx(x) ψy(y) ψz(z). Substituting this back into Equation 3.48, we can obtain three ordinary differential equations, each just like the one for the one-dimensional potential well. Having found
ψx(x), ψy(y), and ψz(z) we know that the total wavefunction is simply the product,
ψ (x, y, z) = A sin(kxx) sin(kyy) sin(kzz)

where kx, ky, kz, and A are constants to be determined. We can then apply the boundary conditions at x = a, y = b, and z = c to determine the constants kx, ky, and kz
in the same way we found k for the one-dimensional potential well. If ψ(x, y, z) = 0
at x = a, then kx will be quantized via
kxa = n1π

where n1 is a quantum number, n1 = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Similarly, if ψ (x, y, z) = 0 at
y = b and z = c, then ky and kz will be quantized, so that, overall, we will have

[3.50]

where n1, n2, and n3 are quantum numbers, each of which can be any integer except zero.
We notice immediately that in three dimensions, we have three quantum numbers
n1, n2, and n3 associated with ψx(x), ψy(y), and ψz(z). The eigenfunctions of the electron, denoted by the quantum numbers n1, n2, and n3, are now given by

Notice that these consist of the products of infinite one-dimensional PE welltype wavefunctions, one for each dimension, and each has its own quantum number n.
Each possible eigenfunction can be labeled a state for the electron. Thus, ψ111 and
ψ121 are two possible states.
To find the constant A in Equation 3.51, we need to use the normalization
condition that ∣ψn1n2n3 (x, y, z)∣2 integrated over the volume of the box must be unity,
since the electron is somewhere in the box. The result for a square box is
A = (2∕a)3∕2.
We can find the energy of the electron by substituting the wavefunction in Equation 3.49 into the Schrödinger Equation 3.48. The energy as a function of kx, ky,
kz is then found to be
E = E(kx, ky, kz ) =

ħ2 2
(kx + k2y + k2z )
2me

which is quantized by virtue of kx, ky, and kz being quantized. We can write this
energy in terms of n21, n22, and n23 by using Equation 3.50, as follows:

[3.52]

where N2 = (n21 + n22 + n23), which can only have certain integer values. It is apparent that the energy now depends on three quantum numbers. Our conclusion is that
in three dimensions, we have three quantum numbers, each one arising from boundary conditions along one of the coordinates. They quantize the energy of the electron
via Equation 3.52 and its momentum in a particular direction, such as, px = ±ħkx =
±(hn1∕2a), though the average momentum is zero.
The lowest energy for the electron is obviously equal to E111, not zero. The next
energy level corresponds to E211, which is the same as E121 and E112, so there are
three states (i.e., ψ211, ψ121, ψ112) for this energy. The number of states that have the
same energy is termed the degeneracy of that energy level. The second energy level
E211 is thus three-fold degenerate.

How many states (eigenfunctions) are
there at energy level E443 for a square potential energy box?

SOLUTION

This energy level corresponds to n1 = 4, n2 = 4, and n3 = 3, but the energy depends on
N2 = n21 + n22 + n23 = 42 + 42 + 32 = 41

via Equation 3.52. As long as N2 = 41 for any choice of (n1, n2, n3), not just (4, 4, 3), the
energy will be the same.

The value N2 = 41 can be obtained from (4, 4, 3), (4, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 4) as well as
(6, 2, 1), (6, 1, 2), (2, 6, 1), (2, 1, 6), (1, 6, 2), and (1, 2, 6). There are thus three states from
(4, 4, 3) combinations and six from (6, 2, 1) combinations, giving nine possible states, each
with a distinct wavefunction, ψn1n2n3 . However, all these ψn1n2n3 for the electron have the same
energy E443.

HYDROGENIC ATOM

3.8.1 ELECTRON WAVEFUNCTIONS
Consider the behavior of the electron in a hydrogenic (hydrogen-like) atom, which
has a nuclear charge of +Ze, as depicted in Figure 3.23. For the hydrogen atom,
Z = 1, whereas for an ionized helium atom He+, Z = 2. For a doubly ionized lithium
atom Li++, Z = 3, and so on. The electron is attracted by a positive nuclear charge
and therefore has a Coulombic PE,
−Ze2
V(r) =
4πεor

[3.53]

Since force F = −dV∕dr, Equation 3.53 is simply a statement of Coulomb’s force
between the positive charge +Ze of the nucleus and the negative charge −e of the
electron. The task of finding ψ (x, y, z) and the energy E of the electron now involves
putting V(r) from Equation 3.53 into the Schrödinger equation with r = √x2 + y2 + z2
and solving it.
Fortunately, the problem has a spherical symmetry, and we can solve the Schrödinger
equation by transforming it into the r, θ, ϕ coordinates shown in Figure 3.23. Even

then, obtaining a solution is not easy. We must then ensure that the solution for
ψ (r, θ, ϕ) satisfies all the boundary conditions, as well as being single-valued and
continuous with a continuous derivative. For example, when we go 2π around the ϕ
coordinate, ψ(r, θ, ϕ) should come back to its original value, or ψ(r, θ, ϕ) = ψ(r, θ,
ϕ + 2π), as is apparent from an examination of Figure 3.23. Along the radial coordinate, we need ψ (r, θ, ϕ) → 0 as r → ∞; otherwise, the total probability will diverge
when ∣ψ(r, θ, ϕ)∣2 is integrated over all space. In an analogy with the three-dimensional
potential well, there should be three quantum numbers to characterize the wavefunction, energy, and momentum of the electron. The three quantum numbers are called
the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers and
are, respectively, denoted by n, ℓ, and mℓ. Unlike the three-dimensional potential
well, however, not all the quantum numbers run as independent positive integers.
The solution to the Schrödinger equation ψ (r, θ, ϕ) depends on three variables,
r, θ, ϕ. The wavefunction ψ(r, θ, ϕ) can be written as the product of two functions
ψ (r, θ, ϕ) = R(r) Y(θ, ϕ)

where R(r) is a radial function depending only on r, and Y(θ, ϕ) is called the spherical harmonic, which expresses the angular dependence of the wavefunction. These
functions are characterized by the quantum numbers n, ℓ, mℓ. The radial part R(r)
depends on n and ℓ, whereas the spherical harmonic depends on ℓ and mℓ, so
ψ (r, θ, ϕ) = ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) = Rn,ℓ (r) Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ)

[3.54]

By solving the Schrödinger equation, these functions have already been evaluated.
It turns out that we can only assign certain values to the quantum numbers n, ℓ, and
mℓ to obtain acceptable solutions, that is, ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) that are well behaved: singlevalued and with ψ and the gradient of ψ continuous. Table 3.2 summarizes the
allowed values of n, ℓ and mℓ. It is clear that while n behaves very much like previous quantum numbers we discovered, ℓ and mℓ do not, and have restrictions imposed
on their values.
The ℓ values carry a special notation inherited from spectroscopic terms. The
first four ℓ values are designated by the first letters of the terms sharp, principal,
diffuse, and fundamental, whereas the higher ℓ values follow from f onwards, as g,
h, i, etc. For example, any state ψn,ℓ,mℓ that has ℓ = 0 is called an s state, whereas
that which has ℓ = 1 is termed a p state. We can also use n as a prefix to ℓ to
identify n. Thus, ψn,ℓ,mℓ with n = 2 and ℓ = 0 corresponds to the 2s state. The notation for identifying the ℓ value and labeling a state is summarized in Table 3.3.
Table 3.4 summarizes the functional forms of Rn,ℓ(r) and Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ). For ℓ = 0
(the s states), the angular dependence of Y0,0(θ, ϕ) is constant, which means that

ψ (r, θ, ϕ) is spherically symmetrical about the nucleus. For the ℓ = 1 and higher
states, there is a strong directionality to the wavefunctions with respect to each other.
The radial part Rn,ℓ(r) is sketched in Figure 3.24a for two choices of n and ℓ. Notice
that Rn,ℓ(r) is largest at r = 0, when ℓ = 0. However, this does not mean that the
electron will be mainly at r = 0, because the probability of finding the electron at
a distance r actually depends on r2∣Rn,ℓ(r)∣2, which vanishes as r → 0.
Let us examine the probability of finding the electron at a distance r within a thin
spherical shell of radius r and thickness δr (assumed to be very small). The directional dependence of the probability will be determined by the function Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ).
We can average this over all directions (all angles θ and ϕ) to obtain Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ),
which turns out to be simply 1∕4π. The volume of the spherical shell is δV = 4πr2δr.
The probability of finding the electron in this shell is then
∣(Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ))(Rn,ℓ (r))∣2 × (4πr 2δr)

If δP(r) represents the probability that the electron is in this spherical shell of thickness δr, then
δP(r) = ∣Rn,ℓ (r)∣2r2δr

Figure 3.24 (a) Radial wavefunctions of the electron in a hydrogenic atom for various n and ℓ values. (b) r2∣Rn,ℓ
∣ gives
the radial probability density. Vertical axis scales are linear in arbitrary units.

The radial probability density Pn,ℓ (r) is defined as the probability per unit
radial distance, that is, dP∕dr which from Equation 3.55 is ∣Rn,ℓ(r)∣2r2. The latter
vanishes at the nucleus and peaks at certain locations, as shown in Figure 3.24b.
This behavior implies that the probability of finding the electron within a thin spherical shell close to the nucleus also disappears. For n = 1, and ℓ = 0, for example,
the maximum probability is at r = ao = 0.0529 nm, which is called the Bohr radius.
Therefore, if the electron is in the 1s state, it spends most of its time at a distance ao.
Notice that the probability distribution does not depend on mℓ, but only on n and ℓ.
Table 3.4 summarizes the nature of the functions Rn,ℓ(r) and Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ) for
various n, ℓ, mℓ values. Each possible wavefunction ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) with a particular
choice of n, ℓ, mℓ constitutes a quantum state for the electron. The function
ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) basically describes the behavior of the electron in the atom in probabilistic terms, as distinct from a well-defined line orbit for the electron, as one might
expect from classical mechanics. For this reason, ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) is often referred to
as an orbital, in contrast to the classical theory, which assigns an orbit to the electron.
Figure 3.25a shows the polar plots of Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ) for s and p orbitals. The radial
distance from the origin in the polar plot represents the magnitude of Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ),
which depends on the angles θ and ϕ. The polar plots of the probability distribution
∣Yℓ,mℓ (θ, ϕ)∣2 are shown in Figure 3.25b. Although for the s states, Y1,0(θ, ϕ) is spherically symmetric, resulting in a spherically symmetrical probability distribution
around the nucleus, this is not so for ℓ = 1 and higher states.
For example, each of the p states has a distinctly directional character, as illustrated in the polar plots in Figure 3.25. The angular dependence of ∣ψ2,1,0(r, θ, ϕ)∣,
for which mℓ = 0, is such that most of the probability is oriented along the z axis.

This wavefunction is referred to as the 2pz orbital. The two wavefunctions for mℓ = ±1
are often represented by ψ2px (r, θ, ϕ) and ψ2py (r, θ, ϕ) , or more simply, 2px and 2py
orbitals, which do not possess a specific mℓ individually, but together represent the
two mℓ = ±1 wavefunctions. The angular dependence of 2px and 2py are essentially
along the x and y directions. Thus, the three orbitals for mℓ = 0, ±1 are all oriented
perpendicular to each other, as depicted in Figure 3.25.
It should be noted that the probability distributions in Figures 3.24b and 3.25b
do not depend on time. As previously mentioned, under steady-state conditions, the
magnitude of the total wavefunction is

∣Ψ (r, θ, ϕ, t)∣ = ψ(r, θ, ϕ) exp(−

which is independent of time.
The quantity ∣Rn,ℓ(r)∣2r2 in Equation 3.55 is called the
radial probability density function and is simply written as Pn,ℓ(r). Thus, dP(r) = Pn,ℓ(r) dr
is the probability of finding the electron between r and r + dr. We can use Pn,ℓ(r) to conveniently
calculate the probability of finding the electron within a certain region of the atom, or to find
the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus, and so on. For example, the electron in the
1s orbital has the wavefunction shown for n = 1, ℓ = 0 in Table 3.4, which decays exponentially,

3.8.2 QUANTIZED ELECTRON ENERGY

Electron

Once the wavefunctions ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) have been found, they can be substituted into
the Schrödinger equation to find the possible energies of the electron. These turn
out to depend only on the principal quantum number n. The energy is given by

This corresponds to the energy required to remove the electron in the hydrogen
atom (Z = 1) from the lowest energy level E1 (at n = 1) to infinity; hence, it represents the ionization energy. The energy En in Equation 3.57b is negative with
respect to that for the electron completely isolated from the nucleus (at r = ∞,
therefore V = 0). Thus, when the electron is in the vicinity of the nucleus, +Ze, it
has a lower energy, which is a favorable situation (hence, formation of the hydrogenic atom is energetically favorable). In general, the energy required to remove an
electron from the nth shell to n = ∞ (where the electron is free) is called the
ionization energy for the nth shell, which from Equation 3.57b is simply ∣En∣ or
(13.6 eV)Z 2∕n2.

Figure 3.26 The energy of the electron in the
hydrogen atom (Z = 1).

Since the energy is quantized, the lowest energy of the electron corresponds to
n = 1, which is −13.6 eV. The next higher energy value it can have is E2 = −3.40 eV
when n = 2, and so on, as sketched in Figure 3.26. Normally, the electron will
take up a state corresponding to n = 1, because this has the lowest energy, called
the ground energy. Its wavefunction corresponds to ψ100(r, θ, ϕ), which has a
probability peak at r = ao and no angular dependence, as indicated in Figures 3.24
and 3.25.
The electron can only become excited to the next energy level if it is supplied
by the right amount of energy E2 − E1. A photon of energy hf = E2 − E1 can readily supply this energy when it strikes the electron. The electron then gets excited
to the state with n = 2 by absorbing the photon, and its wavefunction changes to
ψ210(r, θ, ϕ), which has the maximum probability at r = 4ao. The electron thus spends
most of its time in this excited state, at r = 4ao. It can return from the excited state
at E2 to the ground state at E1 by emitting a photon of energy hf = E2 − E1.
By virtue of the quantization of energy, we see that the emission of light from
excited atoms can only have certain wavelengths: those corresponding to transitions
from higher quantum-number states to lower ones. In fact, in spectroscopic analysis,
these wavelengths can be used to identify the elements, since each element has its
unique set of emission and absorption wavelengths arising from a unique set of
energy levels. Figure 3.27 illustrates the origin of the emission and absorption spectra of atoms, which are a direct consequence of the quantization of the energy.
The electrons in atoms can also be excited by other means, for example, through
electron–atom or atom–atom collisions. For example, when a projectile electron in
a gas discharge tube collides with an atom, it can excite an electron in the atom
to a higher energy level. The atom becomes excited by a collision as shown in

by emitting a photon.

Figure 3.28. If the impinging electron has sufficient kinetic energy, it can impart just
the right energy to excite the electron to a higher energy level. Since the total energy
must be conserved, the incoming electron will lose some of its kinetic energy in the
process. The excited electron can later return to its ground state by emitting a photon. Excitation by atomic collisions is the process by which we obtain light from an
electric discharge in gases, a quantum phenomenon we experience every day as we
read a neon sign. Indeed, this is exactly how the Ne atoms in the common laboratory
HeNe laser are excited, via atomic collisions between Ne and He atoms as explained
in Section 3.10.2.
Since the principal quantum number determines the energy of the electron and
also the position of maximum probability, as we noticed in Figure 3.24, various n
values define electron shells, within which we can most likely find the electron.
These shells are customarily labeled K, L, M, N, . . . , corresponding to n = 1, 2,
3, . . . . For each n value, there are a number of ℓ values that determine the spatial
distribution of the electron. For a given n, each ℓ value constitutes a subshell. For
example, we often talk about 3s, 3p, 3d subshells within the M shell. From the radial
dependence of the electron’s wavefunction ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) , shown in Figure 3.24a, we

3.8

see that for higher values of n, which correspond to more energetic states, the mean
distance of the electron from the nucleus increases. In fact, we observe from Figure
3.24b that an orbital with ℓ = n − 1 (e.g., 1s, 2p) exhibits a single maximum in its
radial probability distribution, and this maximum rapidly moves farther away from
the nucleus as n increases. By examining the electron wavefunctions, we can show
that the location of the maxima for these ℓ = n − 1 states are at
rmax =

where ao is the radius of the ground state (0.0529 nm). The maximum probability
radius rmax in Equation 3.58 is the Bohr radius. Note that rmax in Equation 3.58 is
for ℓ = n − 1 states only. For other ℓ values, there are multiple maxima, and we
must think in terms of the average position of the electron from the nucleus. When
we evaluate the average position from ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) , we see that it depends on both
n and ℓ; strongly on n and weakly on ℓ.

What is the energy required to further ionize He+ ions

EXAMPLE 3.18

SOLUTION

He+ is a hydrogenic atom with one electron attracted by a nucleus with a +2e charge. Thus
Z = 2. The energy of the electron in a hydrogenic atom (in eV) is given by
En (eV) = −

Z 2 13.6
n2

Since Z = 2, the energy required to ionize He+ further is
∣E1∣ = ∣−(22)13.6∣ = 54.4 eV
IONIZATION ENERGY AND EFFECTIVE Z The Li atom has a nucleus with a +3e positive
charge, which is surrounded by a full 1s orbital with two electrons, and a single valence electron in the outer 2s orbital as shown in Figure 3.29a. Intuitively we expect the valence electron to see the nuclear +3e charge shielded by the two 1s electrons, that is, a net charge of
+1e. It seems that we should be able to predict the ionization energy of the 2s electron by
using the hydrogenic atom model and by taking Z = 1 and n = 2 as indicated in Figure 3.29b.
However, according to quantum mechanics, the 2s electron has a probability distribution that
has two peaks as shown in Figure 3.24b; a major peak outside the 1s orbital, and a small
peak around the 1s orbital. Thus, although the 2s electron spends a substantial time outside
the 1s orbital, it does nonetheless penetrate the 1s shell and get close to the nucleus. Instead
of experiencing a net +1e of nuclear charge, it now experiences an effective nuclear charge
that is greater than +1e, which we can represent as +Zeffectivee, where we have used an effective Z. Thus, the ionization energy from the nth shell from Equation 3.57b is
EI,n =

Z2effective (13.6 eV)
n2

[3.59]

The experimental ionization energy of Li is 5.39 eV which corresponds to creating a Li+ ion
and an isolated electron. Calculate the effective nuclear charge seen by the 2s electron.

SOLUTION

The most outer electron in the Li atom is in the 2s orbital, which is the electron that is
removed in the ionization process. For this 2s electron, n = 2, and hence from Equation 3.59
5.39 eV =

Solving, we find Zeffective = 1.26. If we simply use Z = 1 in Equation 3.59, we would find
EI,n = 3.4 eV, too small compared with the experimental value because, according to its probability distribution, the electron spends some time close to the nucleus, and hence increases
its binding energy (stronger attraction). Variables Z and Zeffective should not be confused. Z is
the integer number of protons in the nucleus of the simple hydrogenic atom that are attracting the electron, as in H, He+, or Li++. Zeffective is a convenient way of describing what the
outer electron experiences in an atom because we would like to continue to use the simple
expression for EI,n, Equation 3.59, which was originally derived for a hydrogenic atom.

3.8.3 ORBITAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND SPACE QUANTIZATION

Orbital
angular
momentum

The electron in the atom has an orbital angular momentum L. The electron is attracted
to the nucleus by a central force, just like the Earth is attracted by the central
gravitational force of the sun and thus possesses an orbital angular momentum. It is
well known that in classical mechanics, under the action of a central force, both the
total energy (KE + PE) and the orbital angular momentum (L) of an orbiting object
are conserved. In quantum mechanics, the orbital angular momentum of the electron,
like its energy, is also quantized, but by the quantum number ℓ. The magnitude of
L is given by
L = ħ[ℓ(ℓ + 1)]1∕2
[3.60]
where ℓ = 0, 1, 2, . . . < n. Thus, for an electron in the ground state, n = 1 and
ℓ = 0, the angular momentum is zero, which is surprising since we always think of
the electron as orbiting the nucleus. In the ground state, the spherical harmonic is a
constant, independent of the angles θ and ϕ, so the electron has a spherically symmetrical probability distribution that depends only on r.

Figure 3.30 (a) The electron has an orbital angular momentum, which has a quantized component L along an external
magnetic field Bexternal. (b) The orbital angular momentum vector L rotates about the z axis. Its component Lz is quantized;
therefore, the L orientation, which is the angle θ, is also quantized. L traces out a cone. (c) According to quantum mechanics,
only certain orientations (θ) for L are allowed, as determined by ℓ and mℓ.

The quantum numbers n and ℓ quantize the energy and the magnitude of the
orbital angular momentum. What is the significance of mℓ? In the presence of an
external magnetic field Bz, taken arbitrarily in the z direction, the component of the
angular momentum along the z axis, Lz, is also quantized and is given by
Lz = mℓħ

[3.61]

Therefore, the quantum number mℓ quantizes the component of the angular
momentum along the direction of an external magnetic field Bz, which for reference
purposes is taken along z, as illustrated in Figure 3.30. Therefore, mℓ, is appropriately
called the magnetic quantum number. For any given ℓ, quantum mechanics requires
that mℓ must have values in the range −ℓ, −(ℓ − 1), . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , (ℓ − 1), ℓ.
We see that ∣mℓ∣ ≤ ℓ. Moreover, mℓ can be negative, since Lz can be negative or
positive, depending on the orientation of the angular momentum vector L. Since
∣mℓ∣ ≤ ℓ, L can never align with the magnetic field along z; instead, it makes an
angle with Bz, an angle that is determined by ℓ and mℓ. We say that L is space
quantized. Space quantization is illustrated in Figure 3.30 for ℓ = 2.
Since the energy of the electron does not depend on either ℓ or mℓ we can have
a number of possible states for a given energy. For example, when the energy is E2,
then n = 2, which means that ℓ = 0 or 1. For ℓ = 1, we have mℓ = −1, 0, 1, so
there are a total of three different orbitals for the electron.
Since the electron has a quantized orbital angular momentum, when an electron
interacts with a photon, the electron must obey the law of the conservation of angular

momentum, much as an ice skater does sudden fast spins by pulling in her arms. All
experiments indicate that the photon has an intrinsic angular momentum with a
constant magnitude given by ħ. Therefore, when a photon of energy hf = E2 − E1
is absorbed, the angular momentum of the electron must change. This means that
following photon absorption or emission, both the principal quantum number n and
the orbital angular momentum quantum number ℓ must change.
The rules that govern which transitions are allowed from one state to another as
a consequence of photon absorption or emission are called selection rules. As a
result of photon absorption or emission, we must have
Δℓ = ±1

and

Δmℓ = 0, ±1

[3.62]

As an example, consider the excitation of the electron in the hydrogen atom from
the ground energy E1 to a higher energy level E2. The photon energy hf must be exactly
E2 − E1. The wavefunction of the 1s ground state is ψ1,0,0, whereas there are four
wavefunctions at E2: one 2s state, ψ2,0,0; and three 2p states, ψ2,1,−1, ψ2,1,0, and ψ2,1,1. The
excited electron cannot jump into the 2s state, because Δℓ must be ±1, so it enters a
2p state corresponding to one of the orbitals ψ2,1,−1, ψ2,1,0, or ψ2,1,1. Various allowed
transitions for photon emission in the hydrogen atom are indicated in Figure 3.31.

The energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is given by En(eV) = −13.6∕n2. The

or

12.5 eV

Therefore,
12.5 eV = 13.6 eV − [

]

Solving this for n, we find
n2 =

13.6
= 12.36
(13.6 − 12.5)

so n = 3.51. But n can only be an integer; thus, the electron gets excited to the level n = 3
where its energy is E3 = −13.6∕32 = −1.51 eV.
The energy of the incoming electron after the collision is less by
(E3 − E1) = 13.6 − 1.51 = 12.09 eV

Since the initial energy of the incoming electron was 12.5 eV, it leaves the collision with a
kinetic energy of 12.5 − 12.09 = 0.41 eV. From the E3 level, the electron can undergo a
transition from n = 3 to n = 1,
ΔE31 = −1.51 eV − (−13.6 eV) = 12.09 eV

The emitted radiation will have a wavelength λ given by hc∕λ = ΔE, so that

This will give a wavelength

which is in the red region of the visible spectrum. For the transition from n = 2 to n = 1,
ΔE21 = −3.40 eV − (−13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV

which results in the emission of a photon of wavelength λ21 = hc∕ΔE21 = 121.5 nm. Note
that each transition obeys Δℓ = ±1.

extremely sharp “dark lines” at certain wavelengths, superimposed on a bright continuum at
all other wavelengths, as discovered by Josef von Fraunhofer in 1829. One of these dark lines
occurs in the orange range and another in the blue. Fraunhofer measured their wavelengths
to be 6563 Å and 4861 Å, respectively. With the aid of Figure 3.26, show that these are

3.8.4 ELECTRON SPIN AND INTRINSIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM S
One aspect of electron behavior does not come from the simple Schrödinger equation. That is the spin of the electron about its own axis, which is analogous to the
24-hour spin of Earth around its axis.15 Earth has an orbital angular momentum due
to its motion around the sun, and an intrinsic or spin angular momentum due to its
rotation about its own axis. Similarly, the electron has a spin or intrinsic angular
momentum, denoted by S. In classical mechanics, in the absence of external torques,
spin angular momentum is conserved. In quantum mechanics, this spin angular
momentum is quantized, in a manner similar to that of orbital angular momentum.
The magnitude of the spin has been found to be constant, with a quantized component Sz in the z direction along a magnetic field:
S = ħ[s(s + 1)] 1∕2

where, in an analogy with ℓ and mℓ, we use the quantum numbers s and ms, which
are called the spin and spin magnetic quantum numbers. Contrary to our past
experience with quantum numbers, s and ms are not integers, but are 12 and ±12 ,
respectively. The existence of electron spin was put forward by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck
in 1925 and derived by Dirac from relativistic quantum theory, which is beyond the
scope of this book. Figure 3.32 illustrates the spin angular momentum of the electron
and the two possibilities for Sz. When Sz = +12 ħ, using classical orbital motion as an
analogy, we can label the spin of the electron as being in the clockwise direction,
so Sz = −12 ħ can be labeled as a counterclockwise spin. However, no such true clockwise or counterclockwise spinning of the electron can in reality16 be identified. When
Sz = +12 ħ, we could just as easily label the electron spin as “up,” and call it “down”
when Sz = −12 ħ. This terminology is used henceforth in this book.
Since the magnitude of the electron spin is constant, which is a remarkable fact,
and is determined by s = 21 , we need not mention it further. It can simply be regarded
as a fundamental property of the electron, in much the same way as its mass and
charge. We do, however, need to specify whether ms = +12 or −12 , since each of these
selections gives the electron a different behavior. We therefore need four quantum
numbers to specify what the electron is doing. Each state of the electron needs the
spin magnetic quantum number ms, in addition to n, ℓ, and mℓ. For each orbital
ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) , we therefore have two possibilities: ms = ±21 . The quantum numbers
n, ℓ, and mℓ determine the spatial extent of the electron by specifying the form of
ψn,ℓ,mℓ (r, θ, ϕ) , whereas ms determines the “direction” of the electron’s spin. A full
description of the behavior of the electron must therefore include all four quantum
numbers n, ℓ, mℓ, and ms.
15

Do not take the meaning of “spin” too literally, as in classical mechanics. Remember that the electron is
assumed to have wave-like properties, which can have no classical spin.
The explanation in terms of spin and its two possible orientational directions (“clockwise” and
“counterclockwise”) serve as mental aids in visualizing a quantum mechanical phenomenon. One question,
however, is, “If the electron is a wave, what is spinning?”

An electronic state is a wavefunction that defines both the spatial (ψn,ℓ,mℓ ) and
spin (ms) properties of an electron. Frequently, an electronic state is simply denoted
ψn,ℓ,mℓ,ms , which adds the spin quantum number to the orbital wavefunction.
The quantum numbers are extremely important, because they quantize the various properties of the electron: its total energy, orbital angular momentum, and the
orbital and spin angular momenta along a magnetic field. Their significance is summarized in Table 3.5.
The spin angular momentum S, like the orbital angular momentum, is space
quantized. Sz = ±( 12 ħ) is smaller than S = ħ √3∕2, which means that S can never
line up with z, or a magnetic field, and the angle θ between S and the z axis
can only have two values corresponding to mℓ = +21 and −12 , which means that
cos θ = Sz∕S = ±1∕ √3. Classically, Sz of a spinning object, or the orientation
of S to the z-axis, can be any value inasmuch as classical spin has no space
quantization.

3.8.5 MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT OF THE ELECTRON
Consider the electron orbiting the nucleus with an angular frequency ω as illustrated
in Figure 3.33a. The orbiting electron is equivalent to a current loop. The equivalent
current I due to the orbital motion of the electron is given by the charge flowing per
unit time, I = charge∕period = −e(ω∕2π). The negative sign indicates that current
I flows in the opposite direction to the electron motion. The magnetic field around
the current loop is similar to that of a permanent magnet as depicted in Figure 3.33a.
The magnetic moment is defined as μ = IA, the product of the current and the area
enclosed by the current loop. It is a vector normal to the surface A in a direction
determined by the corkscrew rule applied to the circulation of the current I. If r is
the radius of the orbit (current loop), then the magnetic moment is

This means that the orbital magnetic moment μorbital is in the opposite direction to

Similarly, the spin angular momentum of the electron S leads to a spin magnetic
moment μspin, which is in the opposite direction to S and given by

which is shown in Figure 3.33b. Notice that there is no factor of 2 in the denominator. We see that, as a consequence of the orbital motion and also of spin, the electron
has two distinct magnetic moments. These moments act on each other, just like two
magnets interact with each other. The result is a coupling of the orbital and the spin
angular momenta L and S and their precession about the total angular momentum
J = L + S, which is discussed in Section 3.8.6.
Since both L and S are quantized, so are the orbital and spin magnetic moments
μorbital and μspin. In the presence of an external magnetic field B, the electron has an
additional energy term that arises from the interaction of these magnetic moments
with B. We know from electromagnetism that a magnetic dipole (equivalent to a
magnet) placed in a magnetic field B will have a potential energy PE. (A free magnet will rotate to align with the magnetic field, as in a compass, and thereby reduce
the PE.) The potential energy EBL due to μorbital and B interacting is given by
EBL = −μorbitalB cos θ

where θ is the angle between μorbital and B. The potential energy EBL is minimum
when μorbital (the magnet) and B are parallel, θ = 0. We know that, by definition, the
z axis is always along an external field B, and Lz is the component of L along z
(along B), and is quantized, so that Lz = L cos θ = mℓħ. We can substitute for μorbital
to find
EBL = (

which depends on mℓ, and it is minimum for the smallest mℓ. Since mℓ = −ℓ, . . . ,
0, . . . , +ℓ, negative and positive values through zero, the electron’s energy splits
into a number of levels determined by mℓ. Similarly, the spin magnetic moment μspin
and B interact to give the electron a potential energy ESL,
ESL = (

[3.67]

which depends on ms. Since ms = ±21 , ESL has only two values, positive (ms = +21 )
and negative (ms = −12 ), which add and subtract from the electron’s energy depending

3.8

HYDROGENIC ATOM

275

on whether the spin is up or down. Thus, in an external magnetic field, the electron’s
spin splits the energy level into two levels. The separation ΔESL of the split levels
is (eħ∕me)B, which is 0.12 meV T−1, very small compared with the energy En in
the absence of the field. It should also be apparent that a single wavelength emission λo corresponding to a particular transition from En′ to En will now be split into
a number of closely spaced wavelengths around λo. Although the separation ΔESL
is small, it is still more than sufficient even at moderate fields to be easily detected
and used in various applications. As it turns out, spin splitting of the energy in a
field can be fruitfully used to study the electronic structures of not only atoms and
molecules, but also various defects in semiconductors in what is called electron
spin resonance.

The Stern–Gerlach experiment is quite famous
for demonstrating the spin of the electron and its space quantization. A neutral silver atom
has one outer valence electron in a 4s orbital and looks much like the hydrogenic atom. (We
can simply ignore the inner filled subshells in the Ag atom.). The 4s electron has no orbital
angular momentum. Because of the spin of this one outer 4s electron, the whole Ag atom
has a spin magnetic moment μspin. When Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach (1921–1922) passed
a beam of Ag atoms through a nonuniform magnetic field, they found that the narrow beam
split into two distinct beams as depicted in Figure 3.34a. The interpretation of the experiment
was that the Ag atom’s magnetic moment along the field direction can have only two values,
hence the split beam. This observation agrees with the quantum mechanical fact that in a
field along z, μspin,z = −(e∕me)msħ where ms = + 21 or −12 ; that is, the electron’s spin can have
only two values parallel to the field, or in other words, the electron spin is space quantized.
In the Stern–Gerlach experiment, the nonuniform magnetic field is generated by using a
big magnet with shaped poles as in Figure 3.34a. The N-pole is sharp and the S-pole is wide,
so the magnetic field lines get closer toward the N-pole and hence the magnetic field increases
towards the N-pole. (This is much like a sharp point having a large electric field.) Whenever
a magnetic moment, which we take to be a simple bar magnet, is in a nonuniform field, its
poles experience different forces, say Flarge and Fsmall, and hence the magnet, overall, experiences a net force. The direction of the net force depends on the orientation of the magnet
with respect to the z axis as illustrated in Figure 3.34b for two differently oriented magnets
representing magnetic moments labeled as 1 and 2. The S-pole of magnet 1 is in the high
field region and experiences a bigger pull (Flarge) from the big magnet’s N-pole than the small
force (Fsmall) pulling the N-pole of 1 to the big magnet’s S-pole. Hence magnet 1 is pulled
toward the N-pole and is deflected up. The overall force on a magnetic moment is the difference between Flarge and Fsmall, and its direction here is determined by the force on whichever pole is in the high field region. Magnet 2 on the other hand has its N-pole in the high
field region, and hence is pushed away from the big magnet’s N-pole and is deflected down.
If the magnet is at right angles to the z axis (θ = π∕2), it would experience no net force as
both of its poles would be in the same field. This magnetic moment would pass through
undeflected.
When we pass a stream of classical magnetic moments through a nonuniform field, there
will be all possible orientations of the magnetic moment, from −π to +π, with the field
because there is no space quantization. Classically, the Ag atoms passing through a nonuniform field would be deflected through a distribution of angles and would not split into two

experiment, as shown in Figure 3.34c, an Ag atomic beam is passed along the long-length
of the external magnet to increase the time spent in the nonuniform field, and hence increase
the splitting. The physics remains the same.

3.8.6 TOTAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM J
The orbital angular momentum L and the spin angular momentum S add to give the
electron a total angular momentum J = L + S, as illustrated in Figure 3.35. There
are a number of possibilities for the total angular momentum J, based on the relative
orientations of L and S. For example, for a given L, we can add S either in parallel
or antiparallel, as depicted in Figure 3.35a and b, respectively.
Since in classical physics the total angular momentum of a body (not experiencing an external torque) must be conserved, we can expect J (the magnitude of J) to
be quantized. This turns out to be true. The magnitude of J and its z component
along an external magnetic field are quantized via
J = ħ[ j( j + 1)]1∕2

[3.68]

Jz = mjħ

[3.69]
17

where both j and mj are quantum numbers like ℓ and mℓ, but j and mj can have
fractional values. A rigorous theory of quantum mechanics shows that when ℓ > s,
the quantum numbers for the total angular momentum are given by j = ℓ + s and
ℓ − s and mj = ± j, ±( j − 1). For example, for an electron in a p orbital, where
ℓ = 1, we have j = 23 and 12 , and mj = 32, 21, −12 , and −32 . However, when ℓ = 0 (as for
all s orbitals), we have j = s = 21 and mj = ms = ±12 , which are the only possibilities.
We note from Equations 3.68 and 3.69 that ∣Jz∣ < J and both are quantized, which
means that J is space quantized; its orientation (or angle) with respect to the z axis
is determined by j and mj.
The spinning electron actually experiences a magnetic field Bint due to its orbital
motion around the nucleus. If we were sitting on the electron, then in our reference
frame, the positively charged nucleus would be orbiting around us, which would be
equivalent to a current loop. At the center of this current loop, there would be an
“internal” magnetic field Bint, which would act on the magnetic moment of the
spinning electron to produce a torque. Since L and S add to give J, and since the
latter quantity is space quantized (or conserved), then as a result of the internal
torque on the electron, we must have L and S synchronously precessing about J,
as illustrated in Figure 3.36a. If there is an external magnetic field B taken to be
along z, this torque will act on the net magnetic moment due to J to cause this
quantity to precess about B, as depicted in Figure 3.36b. Remember that the component along the z axis must be quantized and equal to mjħ, so the torque can only
cause precession. To understand the precession of the electron’s angular momentum
about the magnetic field B, think of a spinning top that precesses about the gravitational field of Earth.

THE HELIUM ATOM AND THE PERIODIC TABLE

3.9.1 He ATOM AND PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE
In the He atom, there are two electrons in the presence of a nucleus of charge +2e,
as depicted in Figure 3.37. (Obviously, in higher-atomic-number elements, there
will be Z electrons around a nucleus of charge +Ze.) The PE of an electron in the
He atom consists of two interactions. The first is due to the Coulombic attraction
between itself and the positive nucleus; the second is due to the mutual repulsion
between the two electrons. The PE function V of any one of the electrons, for
example, that labeled as 1, therefore depends on both its distance from the nucleus
r1 and the separation of the two electrons r12. The PE of electron 1 thus depends

[3.70]

When we use this PE in the Schrödinger equation for a single electron, we find
the wavefunction and energy of one of the electrons in the He atom. We thus obtain
the one-electron wavefunction and the energy of one electron within a manyelectron atom.
One immediate and obvious result is that the energy of an electron now depends
not only on n but also on ℓ, because the electron–electron potential energy term (the
second term in Equation 3.70, which contains r12) depends on the relative orientations of the electron orbitals, which change r12. We therefore denote the electron
energy by En,ℓ. The dependence on ℓ is weaker than on n, as shown in Figure 3.38.
As n and ℓ increase, En,ℓ also increases. Notice, however, that the energy of a 4s
state is lower than that of a 3d state, and the same pattern also occurs at 4s and 5s.
One of the most important theorems in quantum physics is the Pauli exclusion
principle, which is based on experimental observations. This principle states that no
two electrons within a given system (e.g., an atom) may have all four identical
quantum numbers, n, ℓ, mℓ, and ms. Each set of values for n, ℓ, mℓ, and ms represents
a possible electronic state, that is, a wavefunction denoted by ψn,ℓ,mℓ,ms , that the electron

may acquire. For example, an electron with the quantum numbers given by 2, 1, 1,
1
2 will have a definite wavefunction ψn,ℓ,mℓ,ms = ψ2,1,1,1∕2 , and it is said to be in the
state 2p, mℓ = 1 and spin up. Its energy will be E2p. The Pauli exclusion principle
requires that no other electron be in this same state.
The orbital motion of an electron is determined by n, ℓ, and mℓ, whereas ms
determines the spin direction (up or down). Suppose two electrons are in the same
orbital state, with identical n, ℓ, mℓ. By the Pauli exclusion principle, they would
have to spin in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 3.39. One would have to spin
“up” and the other “down.” In this case we say that the electrons are spin paired.
Two electrons can thus have the same orbitals (occupy the same region of space) if
they pair their spins. However, the Pauli exclusion principle prevents a third electron
from entering this orbital, since ms can only have two values.
Using the Pauli exclusion principle, we can determine the electronic structure of
many-electron atoms. For simplicity, we will use a box to represent an orbital state
defined by a set of n, ℓ, mℓ values. Each box can take two electrons at most, with their
spins paired. When we put an electron into a box, we are essentially assigning a wavefunction to that electron; that is, we are defining its orbital n, ℓ, mℓ. We use an arrow
to show whether the electron is spinning up or down. As depicted in Figure 3.40, we
arrange all the boxes to correspond to the electronic subshells. As an example, consider
boron, which has five electrons. The first electron enters the 1s orbital at the lowest
energy. The second also enters this orbital by spinning in the opposite direction. The
third goes into the n = 2 orbital. The lowest energy there is in the s orbitals corresponding to ℓ = 0 and mℓ = 0. The fourth electron can also enter the 2s orbital, provided that it spins in the opposite direction. Similarly, the fifth must go into another
orbital, and the next nearest low-energy orbitals are those having ℓ = 1 (p states) and
mℓ = −1, 0, +1. The final electronic structure of the B atom is shown in Figure 3.40.

Figure 3.40 Electronic configurations for the first five elements.
Each box represents an orbital ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ).

We see that because the electron energy depends on n and ℓ, there are a number
of states for a given energy En,ℓ. Each of these states corresponds to different sets
of mℓ and ms. For example, the energy E2,1 (or E2p) corresponding to n = 2, ℓ = 1
has six possible states, arising from mℓ = −1, 0, 1 and ms = +21, −12 . Each mℓ state
can have an electron spinning up or down, ms = +21 or ms = −12 , respectively.
THE NUMBER OF STATES AT AN ENERGY LEVEL Enumerate and identify the states cor-

responding to the energy level E3d, or n = 3, ℓ = 2.
SOLUTION

When n = 3 and ℓ = 2, mℓ and ms can have these following values: mℓ = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,
and ms = + 21, −12 . This means there are 10 combinations. The possible wavefunctions (electron
states) are
∙ ψ3,2,2,1∕2; ψ3,2,1,1∕2; ψ3,2,0,1∕2; ψ3,2,−1,1∕2; ψ3,2,−2,1∕2, all of which have spins up (ms = + 12 )

(ms = −12 )

3.9.2 HUND’S RULE
In the many-electron atom, the electrons take up the lowest-energy orbitals and obey
the Pauli exclusion principle. However, the Pauli exclusion principle does not determine how any two electrons distribute themselves among the many states of a given
n and ℓ. For example, there are six 2p states corresponding to mℓ = −1, 0, +1, with
each mℓ having ms = ±12 . The two electrons could pair their spins and enter a given
mℓ state, or they could align their spins (same ms) and enter different mℓ states. An
experimental fact deducted from spectroscopic studies shows that electrons in the same
n, ℓ orbitals prefer their spins to be parallel (same ms). This is known as Hund’s rule.
The origin of Hund’s rule can be readily understood. If electrons enter the same
mℓ state by pairing their spins (different ms), their quantum numbers n, ℓ, mℓ will be
the same and they will both occupy the same region of space (same ψn,ℓ,mℓ orbital).
They will then experience a large Coulombic repulsion and will have a large Coulombic potential energy. On the other hand, if they parallel their spins (same ms),
they will each have a different mℓ and will therefore occupy different regions of space
(different ψn,ℓ,mℓ orbitals), thereby reducing their Coulombic repulsion.

Figure 3.41 Electronic configurations for C, N, O, F, and Ne atoms.
Notice that in C, N, and O, Hund’s rule forces electrons to align their spins. For the Ne atom, all the K and L orbitals
are full.

The oxygen atom has eight electrons and its electronic structure is shown in
Figure 3.41. The first two electrons enter the 1s box (orbital). The next two enter
the 2s box. But p states can accommodate six electrons, so the remaining four electrons have a choice. Hund’s rule forces three of the four electrons to enter the boxes
corresponding to mℓ = −1, 0, +1, all with their spins parallel. The last electron can
go into any of the 2p boxes, but it has no choice for spin. It must pair its spin with
the electron already in the box. Thus, the oxygen atom has two unpaired electrons
in half-occupied orbitals, as indicated in Figure 3.41. Since these two unpaired electrons spin in the same direction, they give the O atom a net angular momentum. An
angular momentum due to charge rotation (i.e., spin) gives rise to a magnetic moment
μ. If there is an external magnetic field present, then μ experiences a force given
by μ · dB∕dx. Oxygen atoms will therefore be deflected by a nonuniform magnetic
field, as experimentally observed.
Following the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule, it is not difficult to
build the electronic structure of various elements in the Periodic Table. There are
only a few instances of unusual behavior in the energy levels of the electronic states.
The 4s state happens to be energetically lower than the 3d states, so the 4s state fills
up first. Similarly, the 5s state is at a lower energy than the 4d states. These features
are summarized in the energy diagram of Figure 3.38. There is a neat shorthand way
of writing the electronic structure of any atom. To each nℓ state, we attach a superscript to represent the number of electrons in those nℓ states. For example, for
oxygen, we write 1s22s22p4, or simply [He]2s22p4, since 1s2 is a full (closed) shell
corresponding to He.
EXAMPLE 3.25

HUND’S RULE The Fe atom has the electronic structure [Ar]3d 64s2. Show that the Fe atom

has four unpaired electrons and therefore a net angular momentum and a magnetic moment
due to spin.
SOLUTION

In a closed subshell, for example, 2p subshell with six states given by mℓ = −1, 0, +1 and
ms = ±12 , all mℓ and ms values have been taken up by electrons, so each mℓ orbital is occupied
and has paired electrons. Each positive mℓ (or ms) value assigned to an electron is canceled
by the negative mℓ (or ms) value assigned to another electron in the subshell. Therefore, there

STIMULATED EMISSION AND LASERS

3 .1 0

is no net angular momentum from a closed subshell. Only unfilled subshells contribute to the
overall angular momentum. Thus, only the six electrons in the 3d subshell need to be considered.
There are five d orbitals, corresponding to mℓ = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2. Five of the six electrons
obey Hund’s rule and align their spins, with each taking one of the mℓ values.

The sixth must take the same mℓ as another electron. This is only possible if they pair
their spins. Consequently, there are four electrons with unpaired spins in the Fe atom, which
gives the Fe atom a net angular momentum. The Fe atom therefore possesses a magnetic
moment as a result of four electrons having their charges spinning in the same direction.
Many isolated atoms possess unpaired spins and hence also possess a magnetic moment.
For example, the isolated Ag atom has one outer 5s electron with an unpaired spin and hence
it is magnetic; it can be deflected in a magnetic field. The silver crystal, however, is nonmagnetic. In the crystal, the 5s electrons become detached to form the electron gas (metallic
bonding) where they pair their spins, and the silver crystal has no net magnetic moment. The
iron crystal is magnetic because the constituent Fe atoms retain at least two of the unpaired
electron spins which then all align in the same direction to give the crystal an overall magnetic
moment; iron is a magnetic metal.18

STIMULATED EMISSION AND LASERS

3.10.1

STIMULATED EMISSION AND PHOTON AMPLIFICATION

An electron can be excited from an energy level E1 to a higher energy level E2 by
the absorption of a photon of energy hf = E2 − E1, as show in Figure 3.42a. When
an electron at a higher energy level transits down in energy to an unoccupied energy
level, it emits a photon. There are essentially two possibilities for the emission process. The electron can spontaneously undergo the downward transition by itself, or
it can be induced to do so by another photon.
In spontaneous emission, the electron falls in energy from level E2 to E1 and
emits a photon of energy hf = E2 − E1, as indicated in Figure 3.42b. The transition
is only spontaneous if the state with energy E1 is not already occupied by another
electron. In classical physics, when a charge accelerates and decelerates, as in an
oscillatory motion, with a frequency f, it emits an electromagnetic radiation also of
frequency f. The emission process during the transition of the electron from E2 to
E1 appears as if the electron is oscillating with a frequency f.
In stimulated emission,19 an incoming photon of energy hf = E2 − E1 stimulates
the emission process by inducing the electron at E2 to transit down to E1. The emitted photon is in phase with the incoming photon, it is going in the same direction,
18
19

This qualitative explanation is discussed in Chapter 8.
Some authors use the term induced emission, but stimulated emission seems to be more common.

and it has the same frequency, since it must also have the energy E2 − E1, as shown
in Figure 3.42c. Put differently, the two photons are coherent, that is, they have
exactly the same frequency, phase and are traveling in the same direction. To get a
feel for what is happening during stimulated emission, imagine the electric field
of the incoming photon coupling to the electron and thereby driving it with the
same frequency as the photon. The forced oscillation of the electron at a frequency
f = (E2 − E1)∕h causes the electron to emit electromagnetic radiation, for which the
electric field is totally in phase with that of the stimulating photon. When the incoming photon leaves the site, the electron has been forced to return to E1, because it
has emitted a photon of energy hf = E2 − E1.
Stimulated emission is the basis for photon amplification, since one incoming
photon results in two outgoing photons, which are in phase. It is possible to achieve
a practical light amplifying device based on this phenomenon. From Figure 3.42c,
we see that to obtain stimulated emission, the incoming photon should not be
absorbed by another electron at E1. When we are considering using a collection of
atoms to amplify light, we must therefore require that the majority of the atoms be at
the energy level E2. If this were not the case, the incoming photons would be absorbed
by the atoms at E1. When there are more atoms at E2 than at E1, we have what is
called a population inversion. It should be apparent that with two energy levels, we
can never achieve a population at E2 greater than that at E1, because, in the steady
state, the incoming photon flux will cause as many upward excitations as downward
stimulated emissions.
Let us consider the three-energy-level system shown in Figure 3.43. Suppose an
external excitation causes the atoms20 in this system to become excited to energy
level E3. This is called the pump energy level, and the process of exciting the atoms
to E3 is called pumping. In the present case, optical pumping is used, although this
is not the only means of taking the atoms to E3. The atoms at E3 decay rapidly to
the energy level E2 by emitting the excess energy (E3 − E2) as lattice vibrations.
Suppose further that an atom in a state at E2 does not rapidly and spontaneously
decay to a lower energy state. In other words, the state at E2 is a long-lived state.21
20

An atom is in an excited state when one (or more) of its electrons is excited from the ground energy to a
higher energy level. The ground state of an atom has all the electrons in their lowest energy states consistent
with the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule.
21
We will not examine what causes certain states to be long lived; we will simply accept that these states do
not decay rapidly and spontaneously to lower energy states.

(c) Since the states at E2 are metastable,
they quickly become populated, and there
is a population inversion between E2 and E1.
(d) An incoming photon of energy hf21 = E2 − E1
can initiate stimulated emission. Photons
from this stimulated emission can themselves
further stimulate emissions, leading to an
avalanche of stimulated emissions and
coherent photons being emitted.

Quite often, the long-lived states are referred to as metastable states. Since the
atoms cannot decay rapidly from E2 to E1, they accumulate at this energy level,
causing a population inversion between E2 and E1 as pumping takes more and more
atoms to E3 and hence to E2.
When one atom at E2 decays spontaneously, it emits a photon, which can go on
to a neighboring atom and cause that to execute stimulated emission. The photons
from the latter can then go on to the next atom at E2 and cause that atom to emit
by stimulated emission, and so on. The result is an avalanche effect of stimulated
emission processes with all the photons in phase, so the light output is a large collection of coherent photons. This is the principle of the ruby laser in which the
energy levels E1, E2, and E3 are those of the Cr3+ ion in the Al2O3 crystal. At the
end of the avalanche of stimulated emission processes, the atoms at E2 will have
returned to E1 and can be pumped again to repeat the stimulated emission cycle
again. The emission from E2 to E1 is called the lasing emission.
The system we have just described for photon amplification is a LASER, an
acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. In the ruby laser,
pumping is achieved by using a xenon flashlight. The lasing atoms are chromium
ions (Cr3+) in a crystal of alumina Al2O3 (sapphire), and the lasing emission from

E2 to E1 is at 694 nm (red). We can increase stimulated emissions by increasing the
number of photons, that is, the radiation intensity within the crystal inasmuch as
more photons cause more stimulated emissions. The ends of the ruby crystal, which
is normally a rod, are silvered to reflect back and forward the stimulated radiation,
that is, to form an optical cavity with mirrors at the ends, as shown in Figure 3.44a.
As the stimulated photons are reflected back into the crystal, the radiation intensity
builds up inside the crystal, in much the same way we build up voltage oscillations
in an electrical oscillator circuit by feedback. The build-up of coherent radiation in
the cavity encourages further stimulated emissions, until a large avalanche of stimulated transitions occur and takes most of the ions at E2 down to E1. One of the

mirrors is partially silvered to allow some of this radiation to be tapped out. What
comes out is a pulse of highly coherent radiation that has a high intensity as depicted
in Figure 3.44b. Practical ruby lasers need efficient optical pumping, which can be
obtained by using an elliptical reflector with the ruby crystal rod at one focus, and
the pump light, a xenon flash, at the other focus as shown in Figure 3.44b. The early
ruby lasers used a helical xenon flash tube surrounding the ruby rod. The lasing
emission from the ruby laser is a light pulse, whose duration and intensity depend
on the laser construction, and the xenon flash. Ruby lasers are frequently used in
interferometry, holography, hair, and tattoo removal, among other applications.
The coherency and the well-defined wavelength of the emitted radiation from a
laser are attributes that make it distinctly different from a random stream of different
wavelength photons emitted from a tungsten bulb, or randomly phased photons from
an LED. The photon energy emitted from the laser system is less than the photon
energy we used to pump it, that is, excite it; hf21 < hf13. However, we only needed
incoherent radiation to pump the system, and we obtained a fully coherent radiation
as output.

3.10.2 HELIUM–NEON LASER
With the helium–neon (HeNe) laser, the actual operation is not simple, since we
need to know such things as the energy states of the whole atom. We will therefore
only consider the lasing emission at 632.8 nm, which gives the well-known red color
to the laser light. The actual stimulated emission occurs from the Ne atoms; He
atoms are used to excite the Ne atoms by atomic collisions.
Ne is an inert gas with a ground state (1s22s22p6), which is represented as (2p6)
when the inner closed 1s and 2s subshells are ignored. If one of the electrons from
the 2p orbital is excited to a 5s orbital, the excited configuration (2p55s1) is a state
of the Ne atom that has higher energy. Similarly, He is an inert gas with the groundstate configuration of (1s2). The state of He when one electron is excited to a 2s
orbital can be represented as (1s12s1), which has higher energy.
Ali Javan and his associates William Bennett Jr. and Donald
Herriott at Bell Labs were first to successfully demonstrate a
continuous wave (cw) helium–neon laser operation (1960).

The HeNe laser consists of a gaseous mixture of He and Ne atoms in a gas discharge
tube, as shown schematically in Figure 3.45. The ends of the tube are mirrored to
reflect the stimulated radiation and to build up the radiation intensity within the cavity.
If sufficient dc high voltage is used, electric discharge is obtained within the tube,
causing the He atoms to become excited by collisions with the drifting electrons. Thus,
He + e− → He* + e−

where He* is an excited He atom.
The excitation of the He atom by an electron collision puts the second electron
in He into a 2s state, so the excited He atom, He*, has the configuration (1s12s1).
This atom is metastable (long lasting) with respect to the (1s2) state, as shown schematically in Figure 3.46. He* cannot spontaneously emit a photon and decay down
to the (1s2) ground state because Δℓ must be ±1. Thus, a large number of He* atoms
build up during the electric discharge.
When an excited He atom collides with a Ne atom, it transfers its energy to the
Ne atom by resonance energy exchange. This happens because, by good fortune, Ne
has an empty energy level, corresponding to the (2p55s1) configuration, which
matches that of (1s12s1) of He*. The collision process excites the Ne atom and deexcites He* down to its ground energy, that is,
He* + Ne → He + Ne*

With many He*–Ne collisions in the gaseous discharge, we end up with a large
number of Ne* atoms and a population inversion between the (2p55s1) and (2p53p1)
states of the Ne atom, as indicated in Figure 3.46. The spontaneous emission of a
photon from one Ne* atom falling from 5s to 3p gives rise to an avalanche of
stimulated emission processes, which leads to a lasing emission with a wavelength
of 632.8 nm, in the red.
There are a few interesting facts about the HeNe laser, some of which are quite
subtle. First, the (2p55s1) and (2p53p1) electronic configurations of the Ne atom

actually have a spread of energies. For example for Ne(2p55s1), there are four closely
spaced energy levels. Similarly, for Ne(2p53p1), there are 10 closely separated energies. We can therefore achieve population inversion with respect to a number of
energy levels. As a result, the lasing emissions from the HeNe laser contain a variety of wavelengths. The two lasing emissions in the visible spectrum, at 632.8 nm
and 543 nm, can be used to build a red or green HeNe laser. Further, we should
note that the energy of the Ne(2p54p1) state (not shown) is above that of Ne(2p53p1)
but below that of Ne(2p55s1). Consequently, there will also be stimulated transitions
from Ne(2p55s1) to Ne(2p54p1), and hence a lasing emission at a wavelength of
∼3.39 μm in the infrared. To suppress lasing emissions at the unwanted wavelengths
(e.g., the infrared) and to obtain lasing only at the wavelength of interest, we can
make the reflecting mirrors wavelength selective. This way the optical cavity builds
up optical oscillations at the selected wavelength.
From (2p53p1) energy levels, the Ne atoms decay rapidly to the (2p53s1) energy
levels by spontaneous emission. Most of the Ne atoms with the (2p53s1) configuration,
however, cannot simply return to the ground state 2p6, because the return of the electron in 3s requires that its spin be flipped to close the 2p subshell. An electromagnetic
radiation cannot change the electron spin. Thus, the Ne(2p53s1) energy levels are metastable. The only possible means of returning to the ground state (and for the next
repumping act) is collisions with the walls of the laser tube. Therefore, we cannot
increase the power obtainable from a HeNe laser simply by increasing the laser tube
diameter, because that will accumulate more Ne atoms at the metastable (2p53s1) states.
A typical HeNe laser, illustrated in Figure 3.45, consists of a narrow glass tube
that contains the He and Ne gas mixture (typically, the He to Ne ratio is 10:1). The

289

290

CHAPTER 3

∙

ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS

lasing emission intensity increases with tube length, since more Ne atoms are then
used in stimulated emission. The intensity decreases with increasing tube diameter,
since Ne atoms in the (2p53s1) states can only return to the ground state by collisions
with the walls of the tube. The ends of the tube are generally sealed with a flat
mirror (99.9 percent reflecting) at one end and, for easy alignment, a concave mirror
(98.5 percent reflecting) at the other end, to obtain an optical cavity within the tube.
The outer surface of the concave mirror is ground to behave like a convergent lens,
to compensate for the divergence in the beam arising from reflections from the
concave mirror. The output radiation from the tube is typically a beam of diameter
0.5–1 mm and a divergence of 1 milliradians at a power of a few milliwatts. In highpower HeNe lasers, the mirrors are external to the tube. In addition, Brewster windows are fused at the ends of the laser tube, to allow only polarized light to be
transmitted and amplified within the cavity, so that the output radiation is polarized
(that is, has electric field oscillations in one plane).

3.10.3 LASER OUTPUT SPECTRUM

Doppler
effect

Doppler
effect

The output radiation from a laser is not actually at one single well-defined wavelength
corresponding to the lasing transition. Instead, the output covers a spectrum of wavelengths with a central peak. This is not a simple consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (which does broaden the output). Predominantly, it is a result of the
broadening of the emitted spectrum by the Doppler effect. We recall from the kinetic
molecular theory that gas atoms are in random motion, with an average translational
kinetic energy of 32 kT . Suppose that these gas atoms emit radiation of frequency fo
which we label as the source frequency. Then, due to the Doppler effect, when a gas
atom moves toward an observer, the latter detects a higher frequency f2, given by
vx
f2 = fo(1 + )
c
where vx is the relative velocity of the atom with respect to the observer and c is
the speed of light. When the atom moves away, the observer detects a smaller
frequency, which corresponds to
vx
f1 = fo(1 − )
c

3 .1 0

STIMULATED EMISSION AND LASERS

291

Since the atoms are in random motion, the observer will detect a range of frequencies, due to this Doppler effect as shown in Figure 3.47a. As a result, the
frequency or wavelength of the output radiation from a gas laser will have a “linewidth”
of Δf = f2 − f1, called a Doppler-broadened linewidth of a laser radiation. Other
mechanisms also broaden the output spectrum, but we will ignore these at present.
The reflections from the laser end mirrors give rise to traveling waves in opposite directions within the cavity. Since the oppositely traveling waves have the same
frequency, they interfere to set up a standing wave—in other words, stationary electromagnetic oscillations in the tube. Some of the energy in this wave is tapped by the
99 percent reflecting mirror to get an output, in much the same way that we tap the
energy from an oscillating field in an LC circuit by attaching an antenna to it.
Only standing waves with certain wavelengths can be maintained within the
optical cavity, just as only certain acoustic wavelengths can be obtained from musical instruments. Any standing wave in the cavity must have a half-wavelength λ∕2
that fits into the cavity length L, or
λ
m( ) = L

Laser cavity
modes

where m is an integer called the mode number of the standing wave. Each possible
standing wave within the laser tube (cavity) satisfying Equation 3.71 is called a
cavity mode. The allowed cavity modes are shown in Figure 3.47b. The laser output thus has a broad spectrum with peaks at certain wavelengths corresponding to
various cavity modes existing within the Doppler-broadened emission curve. Figure
3.47c shows the expected output from a typical gas laser. At wavelengths satisfying
Equation 3.71, that is, representing certain cavity modes, we have intensity spikes
in the output. The net envelope of the output radiation is a Gaussian distribution,
which is essentially due to Doppler broadening.
Even though we can try to get as parallel a beam as possible by lining the mirrors up perfectly, we will still be faced with diffraction effects at the output. When
the output laser beam hits the end of the laser tube, it becomes diffracted, so the
emerging beam is necessarily divergent. Simple diffraction theory can readily predict
the divergence angle.

Due to the Doppler effect, the laser radiation from gas lasers is broadened around a central
frequency fo, which corresponds to the source frequency. Higher frequencies detected will be
due to radiations emitted from atoms moving toward the observer, and lower frequencies
detected will be the result of emissions from atoms moving away from the observer. Therefore, the width of the observed frequencies will be approximately

A light signal that is traveling along an optical fiber communications link over a long

at certain intervals for long-haul communications over several thousand kilometers.

Instead of regenerating the optical signal by photodetection, conversion to an electrical signal, amplification, and then conversion back from electrical to light energy by
a laser diode, it becomes practical to amplify the signal directly by using an optical
amplifier. The photons in an optical signal have a wavelength of 1550 nm, and optical amplifiers have to amplify signal photons at this wavelength.
One practical optical amplifier is based on the erbium (Er3+ ion) doped fiber
amplifier (EDFA). The core region of an optical fiber is doped with Er3+ ions. The
host fiber core material is a glass based on SiO3–GeO2 and perhaps some other
glass-forming oxides such as Al2O3. It is easily fused to a long-distance optical fiber
by a technique called splicing.
When the Er3+ ion is implanted in the host glass material, it has the energy
levels indicated in Figure 3.48 where E1 corresponds to the lowest energy possible
consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule. One of the convenient
energy levels for optically pumping the Er3+ ion is at E3, approximately 1.27 eV
above the ground energy level. The Er3+ ions are optically pumped, usually from a
laser diode, to excite them to E3. The wavelength for this pumping is about 980 nm.
The Er3+ ions decay rapidly from E3 to a long-lived energy level at E2 which has a
long lifetime of ∼10 ms (very long on the atomic scale). The decay from E3 to E2
involves energy losses by radiationless transitions (generation of lattice vibrations22)
and are very rapid. Thus, more and more Er3+ ions accumulate at E2 which is 0.80
eV above the ground energy. The accumulation of Er3+ ions at E2 leads to a population inversion between E2 and E1. Signal photons at 1550 nm have an energy of 0.80
eV, or E2 − E1, and give rise to stimulated transitions of Er3+ ions from E2 to E1.
Any Er3+ ions left at E1, however, will absorb the incoming 1550 nm photons to
reach E2. To achieve light amplification we must therefore have stimulated emission
exceeding absorption. This is only possible if there are more Er3+ ions at the E2 level
than at the E1 level, that is, if we have population inversion. With sufficient optical
pumping, population inversion is readily achieved.

Lattice vibrations refer to the coupled vibrations of atoms in the crystal. (Atoms are coupled to each other

DEFINING TERMS
Angular momentum L about a point O is defined as
L = p × r, where p is the linear momentum and r is
the position vector of the body from O. For a circular
orbit around O, the angular momentum is orbital and
L = pr = mvr.

Compton effect is the scattering of a high-energy
photon by a “free” electron. The effect is experimentally observed when an X-ray beam is scattered from a
target that contains many conduction (“free”) electrons, such as a metal or graphite.

Bragg diffraction law describes the diffraction of an
X-ray beam by a crystal in which the interplanar separation d of a given set of atomic planes causing the Xray diffraction is related to the diffraction angle 2θ and
the wavelength λ of the X-rays through 2d sin θ = nλ
where n is an integer, usually unity.

De Broglie relationship relates the wave-like properties (e.g., wavelength λ) of matter to its particle-like
properties (e.g., momentum p) via λ = h∕p.

Complementarity principle suggests that the wave
model and the particle model are complementary models in that one model alone cannot be used to explain
all the observations in nature. For example, the electron diffraction phenomenon is best explained by the
wave model, whereas in the Compton experiment, the
electron is treated as a particle; that is, it is deflected by
an impinging photon that imparts an additional momentum to the electron.

Diffraction is the bending of waves as a result of the
interaction of the waves with an object of size comparable to the wavelength. If the object has a regular pattern, periodicity, an incident beam of waves can be
bent (diffracted) in certain well-defined directions that
depend on the periodicity, which is used in the X-ray
diffraction study of crystals.
Doppler effect is the change in the measured frequency of a wave due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. In the case of electromagnetic
radiation, if v is the relative velocity of the source object toward the observer and fo is the source frequency,

DEFINING TERMS
then the measured electromagnetic wave frequency is
f = fo[1 + (v∕c)] for (v∕c) ≪ 1.
Energy density ρE is the amount of energy per unit
volume. In a region where the electric field is E, the
energy stored per unit volume is 12 ε0E2.
Flux density is a term used to describe the rate of
flow through a unit area. If ΔN is the number of particles flowing through an area A in time Δt, then particle flux Γ is defined as Γ = ΔN∕(AΔt). If an amount
of energy ΔE flows through an area A in time Δt, energy flux is ΓE = ΔE∕(AΔt), which defines the intensity (I ) of an electromagnetic wave.
Flux in radiometry is the flow of radiation (electromagnetic wave) energy per unit time in watts. It is simply the radiation power that is flowing. In contrast, the
photon or particle flux refers to the number of photons
or particles flowing per unit time per unit area. Radiant
flux emitted by a source refers to the radiation power
in watts that is emitted. Flux in radiometry normally
has either radiant or luminous as an adjective, e.g.,
radiant flux, luminous flux.
Ground state is the state of the electron with the lowest energy.
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that the
uncertainty Δx in the position of a particle and the uncertainty Δpx in its momentum in the x direction obey
(Δx)(Δpx) ≳ ħ. This is a consequence of the wave nature of matter and has nothing to do with the precision
of measurement. If ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy
of a particle during a time Δt, then according to the
uncertainty principle, (ΔE)(Δt) ≳ ħ. To measure the
energy of a particle without any uncertainty means that
we would need an infinitely long time Δt → ∞.
Hund’s rule states that electrons in a given subshell
nℓ try to occupy separate orbitals (different mℓ) and
keep their spins parallel (same ms). In doing so, they
achieve a lower energy than pairing their spins (different ms) and occupying the same orbital (same mℓ).
Intensity (I) is the flow of energy per unit area per
unit time. It is equal to an energy flux.
LASER (light amplification by stimulated emission
of radiation) is a device within which photon multiplication by stimulated emission produces an output
radiation that is nearly monochromatic and coherent

295

(vis-à-vis an incoherent stream of photons from a tungsten light bulb). Furthermore, the output beam has very
little divergence.
Luminous flux or power Φv is a measure of flow of
“visual energy” per unit time that takes into account
the wavelength dependence of the efficiency of the human eye, that is, whether the energy that is flowing is
perceptible to the human eye. It is a measure of “brightness.” One lumen of luminous flux is obtained from a
1.58 mW light source emitting a single wavelength of
555 nm (green).
Magnetic quantum number mℓ specifies the component of the orbital angular momentum Lz in the direction of a magnetic field along z so that Lz = ±ħmℓ,
where mℓ can be a negative or positive integer from
−ℓ to +ℓ including 0, that is, −ℓ, −(ℓ − 1), . . . , 0, . . . ,
(ℓ − 1), ℓ. The orbital ψ of the electron depends on mℓ,
as well as on n and ℓ. The mℓ, however, generally determines the angular variation of ψ.
Orbital is a region of space in an atom or molecule
where an electron with a given energy may be found.
Two electrons with opposite spins can occupy the same
orbital. An orbit is a well-defined path for an electron,
but it cannot be used to describe the whereabouts of the
electron in an atom or molecule, because the electron
has a probability distribution. The wavefunction
ψnℓmℓ (r, θ, ϕ) is often referred to as an orbital that represents the spatial distribution of the electron, since
∣ψnℓmℓ (r, θ, ϕ)∣2 is the probability of finding the electron per unit volume at (r, θ, ϕ).
Orbital (angular momentum) quantum number
specifies the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum of the electron via L = ħ √ [ℓ(ℓ + 1)], where ℓ is
the orbital quantum number with values 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
n − 1. The ℓ values 0, 1, 2, 3 are labeled the s, p, d, f
states.
Orbital wavefunction describes the spatial dependence of the electron, not its spin. It is ψ (r, θ, ϕ), which
depends on n, ℓ, and mℓ, with the spin dependence
ms excluded. Generally, ψ (r, θ, ϕ) is simply called an
orbital.
Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two electrons in a given system may have the same set of quantum numbers, n, ℓ, mℓ, ms. In other words, no two

296

CHAPTER 3

ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS

electrons can occupy a given state ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms).
Equivalently, up to two electrons with opposite spins
can occupy a given orbital ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ).
Photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from
a metal upon illumination with a frequency of light
above a critical value which depends on the material.
The kinetic energy of the emitted electron is independent of the light intensity and dependent on the light
frequency f, via KE = hf − Φ where h is Planck’s constant and Φ is a material-related constant called the
work function.
Photon is a quantum of energy hf (where h is Planck’s
constant and f is the frequency) associated with electromagnetic radiation. A photon has a zero rest mass
and a momentum p given by the de Broglie relationship p = h∕λ, where λ the wavelength. A photon does
have a “moving mass” of hf∕c2, so it experiences gravitational attraction from other masses. For example,
light from a star gets deflected as it passes by the sun.
Population inversion is the phenomenon of having
more atoms occupy an excited energy level E2, higher
than a lower energy level, E1, which means that the
normal equilibrium distribution is reversed; that is,
N(E2) > N(E1). Population inversion occurs temporarily as a result of the excitation of a medium (pumping).
If left on its own, the medium will eventually return to
its equilibrium population distribution, with more atoms
at E1 than at E2. For gas atoms, this means N(E2)∕
N(E1) ≈ exp[−(E2 − E1)∕kT].
Principal quantum number n is an integer quantum
number with values 1, 2, 3, . . . that characterizes the
total energy of an electron in an atom. The energy increases with n. With the other quantum numbers ℓ and
mℓ, n determines the orbital of the electron in an atom,
or ψnℓmℓ (r, θ, ϕ) . The values n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . are
labeled the K, L, M, N, . . . shells, within each of which
there may be subshells based on ℓ = 0, 1, 2, . . . (n − 1)
and corresponding to the s, p, d, . . . states.

Radiant power is radiation energy flowing, or emitted from a source, per unit time, which is also known as
optical power even if the wavelength is not within the
visible spectrum. Radiant flux signifies radiant power
flow in radiometry, measured in watts.
Radiation normally signifies a traveling electromagnetic wave that is carrying energy. Due to the particlelike behavior of waves, radiation can also mean a
stream of photons.
Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in
nature, the solution of which describes the wave-like
behavior of a particle. The equation cannot be derived
from a more fundamental law. Its validity is based on
its ability to predict any known physical phenomena.
The solution requires as input the potential energy
function V(x, y, z, t) of the particle and the boundary
and initial conditions. The PE function V(x, y, z, t)
describes the interaction of the particle with its environment. The time-independent Schrödinger equation
describes the wave behavior of a particle under
steady-state conditions, that is, when the PE is timeindependent V(x, y, z). If E is the total energy and

The solution of the time-independent Schrödinger
equation gives the wavefunction ψ (x, y, z) of the
electron and its energy E. The interpretation of the
wavefunction ψ (x, y, z) is that ∣ψ (x, y, z)∣2 is the probability of finding the electron per unit volume at
point x, y, z.

Pumping means exciting atoms from their ground
states to higher energy states.

Selection rules determine what values of ℓ and mℓ are
allowed for an electron transition involving the emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation, that
is, a photon. In summary, Δℓ = ±1 and Δmℓ = 0, ±1.
The spin number ms of the electron remains unchanged.
Within an atom, the transition of the electron from one
state ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms) to another ψ (n′, ℓ′, m′ℓ, m′s), due
to collisions with other atoms or electrons, does not
necessarily obey the selection rules.

Radiant is a common adjective used to imply the involvement of radiation, that is, electromagnetic waves,
in the noun that it qualifies; e.g., radiant energy is the
energy transmitted by radiation.

Spin of an electron S is its intrinsic angular momentum (analogous to the spin of Earth around its own
axis), which is space quantized to have two possibilities. The magnitude of the electron’s spin is a constant,

DEFINING TERMS
ħ √3∕2, but its component along a magnetic field in
the z direction is msħ, where ms is the spin magnetic
quantum number, which is + 12 or −12 .
Spontaneous emission is the phenomenon in which a
photon is emitted when an electron in a high energy state
ψ(n, ℓ, mℓ, ms) with energy E2 spontaneously falls down
to a lower, unoccupied energy state ψ (n′, ℓ′, m′ℓ, m′s)
with energy E1. The photon energy is hf = (E2 − E1).
Since the emitted photon has an angular momentum,
the orbital quantum number ℓ of the electron must
change, that is Δℓ = ℓ′ − ℓ = ±1.
State is a possible wavefunction for the electron that
defines its spatial (orbital) and spin properties. For example, ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms) is a state of the electron. From
the Schrödinger equation, each state corresponds to a
certain electron energy E. We use the terms state of
energy E, or energy state. There is generally more than
one state ψ with the same energy E.
Stimulated emission is the phenomenon in which an
incoming photon of energy hf = E2 − E1 interacts with
an electron in a high-energy state ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms) at E2,
and induces that electron to oscillate down to a lower,
unoccupied energy state, ψ (n′, ℓ′, m′ℓ, m′s) at E1. The
photon emitted by stimulation has the same energy and
phase as the incoming photon, and it moves in the same
direction. Consequently, stimulated emission results in
two coherent photons, with the same energy, traveling
in the same direction. The stimulated emission process
must obey the selection rule Δℓ = ℓ′ − ℓ = ±1, just as
spontaneous emission must.
Tunneling is the penetration of an electron through a
potential energy barrier by virtue of the electron’s
wave-like behavior. In classical mechanics, if the energy E of the electron is less than the PE barrier Vo, the
electron cannot cross the barrier. In quantum mechanics, there is a distinct probability that the electron will
“tunnel” through the barrier to appear on the other
side. The probability of tunneling depends very strongly
on the height and width of the PE barrier.
Wave is a periodically occurring disturbance, such as
the displacement of atoms from their equilibrium positions in a solid carrying sound waves, or a periodic
variation in a measurable quantity, such as the electric
field E(x, t) in a medium or space. In a traveling wave,

297

energy is transferred from one location to another by
the oscillations. For example, Ey(x, t) = Eo sin(kx − ωt)
is a traveling wave in the x direction, where k = 2π∕λ
and ω = 2πf. The electric field in the y direction varies
periodically along x, with a period λ called the wavelength. The field also varies with time, with a period
1∕f, where f is the frequency. The wave propagates
along the x direction with a velocity of propagation c.
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves in which
the electric and magnetic fields Ey(x, t) and Bz(x, t) are
at right angles to each other, as well as to the direction
of propagation x. A traveling wave in the electric field
must be accompanied by a similar traveling wave in the
associated magnetic field Bz(x, t) = Bzo sin(kx − ωt).
Typical wave-like properties are interference and
diffraction.
Wave equation is a general partial differential equation in classical physics, of the form
v2

∂ 2 u ∂ 2u
− 2 =0
∂x2
∂t

the solution of which describes the space and time dependence of the displacement u(x, t) from equilibrium
or zero, given the boundary conditions. The parameter
v in the wave equation is the propagation velocity of
the wave. In the case of electromagnetic waves in a
vacuum, the wave equation describes the variation of
the electric (or magnetic) field E(x, t) with space and
time, (c2∂2E∕∂x2) − (∂2E∕∂t2) = 0, where c is the speed
of light.
Wavefunction Ψ(x, y, z, t) is a probability-based function used to describe the wave-like properties of a particle. It is obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation,
which in turn requires a knowledge of the PE of the
particle and the boundary and initial conditions. The
term ∣Ψ(x, y, z, t)∣2 is the probability per unit volume of
finding the electron at (x, y, z) at time t. In other words,
∣Ψ(x, y, z, t)∣2 dx dy dz is the probability of finding the
electron in the small volume dx dy dz at (x, y, z) at time t.
Under steady-state conditions, the wavefunction can be
separated into a space-dependent component and a
time-dependent component, i.e., Ψ(x, y, z, t) = ψ(x, y, z)
exp(−jEt∕ħ), where E is the energy of the particle and
ħ = h∕2π. The spatial component ψ(x, y, z) satisfies the
time-independent Schrödinger equation.

c. Suppose that a solar cell device can convert each sunlight photon into an electron, which can
then give rise to an external current. What is the maximum current that can be supplied per unit

Photons from an industrial CO2 laser CO2 lasers are used in metal cutting. The laser beam output
has a wavelength of 10.6 μm. The laser generates repetitive pulses of radiation in which the radiation
is on for a time ton and off for a time toff and the pulses are repeated at a repetition rate of f s−1. The
duty cycle for this operation is defined as ton∕(ton + toff). A typical CO2 laser used in metal cutting
has an average power of 1 kW and a duty cycle of 60 percent. The repetition frequency is 1 kHz.

3.4

Yellow, cyan, magenta, and white Three primary colors, red, green, and blue (RGB), can be added
together in various proportions to generate any color on various displays and light emitting devices
in what is known as the additive theory of color. For example, yellow can be generated from adding
red and green, cyan from blue and green, and magenta from red and blue.
a. A device engineer wants to use three light emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate various colors in an
LED-based color display that is still in the research stage. His three LEDs have wavelengths of
660 nm for red, 563 nm for green, and 450 nm for blue. He simply wishes to generate the yellow
and cyan by mixing equal optical powers from these LEDs; optical power, or radiant power, is defined
as the radiation energy emitted per unit time. What are the numbers of red and blue photons needed
(to the nearest integer) to generate yellow and cyan, respectively, for every 100 green photons?
b. An equi-energy white light is generated by mixing red, green, and blue light in equal optical

blue (which is one set of possible standard primary colors). Suppose that the optical power in
each primary color is 0.1 W. Calculate the total photon flux (photons per second) needed from
each primary color.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS

There are bright white LEDs on the market that generate the white light by mixing yellow (a
combination of red and green) with blue emissions. The inexpensive types use a single blue LED
to generate a strong blue radiation, some of which is absorbed by a phosphor in front of the LED
which then emits yellow light. The yellow and the blue passing through the phosphor mix and
make up the white light. In one type of white LED, the blue and yellow wavelengths are 450 nm
and 564 nm, respectively. White light can be generated by setting the optical (radiative) power
ratio of yellow to blue light emerging from the LED to be about 1.74. What is the ratio of the
number of blue to yellow photons needed? (Sometimes the mix is not perfect and the white LED
light tends to have a noticeable slight blue tint.) If the total optical power output from the white
LED is 100 mW, calculate the blue and yellow total photon fluxes (photons per second).

Brightness of laser pointers The brightness of a light source depends not only on the radiation
(optical) power emitted by the source but also on its wavelength because the human eye perceives
each wavelength with a different efficiency. The visual “brightness” of a source as observed by an
average daylight-adapted eye is proportional to the radiation power emitted, called the radiant flux
Φe, and the efficiency of the eye to detect the spectrum of the emitted radiation. While the eye can
see a red color source, it cannot see an infrared source and the brightness of the infrared source would
be zero. The luminous flux Φv is a measure of brightness, in lumens (l m), and is defined by
Φv = Φe × (683 1m W−1) × ηeye

[3.72]

Luminous flux,
brightness

where Φe is the radiant flux or the radiation power emitted (in watts) and ηeye = ηeye(λ) is the relative
luminous efficiency (or the relative sensitivity) of an average light-adapted eye which depends on the
wavelength; ηeye is a Gaussian looking function with a peak of unity at 555 nm. (See Figure 3.50 for
ηeye vs. λ.) One lumen of luminous flux, or brightness, is obtained from a 1.46 mW light source
emitting at a single wavelength of 555 nm (green). A typical 60 W incandescent lamp provides roughly
900 lm. When we buy a light bulb, we are buying lumens. Consider one 5 mW red 650 nm laser
pointer, and another weaker 2 mW green 532 nm laser: ηeye(650 nm) = 0.11 and ηeye(532 nm) = 0.86.

Figure 3.50 (a) The retina in the eye has photoreceptors (cones and rods) that can sense the incident
photons on them and hence provide necessary visual perception signals. It has been estimated that for
minimum visual perception there must be roughly 90 photons falling on the cornea of the eye. (b) The
wavelength dependence of the relative efficiency ηeye(λ) of the eye is different for daylight vision, or photopic
vision (involves mainly cones), and for vision under dimmed light, or scotopic vision, which represents the

of photons emitted per unit time, the total photon flux, by each laser.
3.6

Human eye Photons passing through the pupil are focused by the lens onto the retina of the eye
and are detected by two types of photosensitive cells, called rods and cones, as visualized in Figure 3.50.
Rods are highly sensitive photoreceptors with a peak response at a wavelength of about 507 nm
(green-cyan). They do not register color and are responsible for our vision under dimmed light conditions, termed scotopic vision. Cones are responsible for our color perception and daytime vision,
called photopic vision. These three types of cone photoreceptors are sensitive to blue, green, and red
at wavelengths, respectively, of 430 nm, 535 nm, and 575 nm. All three cones have an overall peak
response at 555 nm (green), which represents the peak response of an average daylight-adapted eye
or in our photopic vision.
a. Calculate the photon energy (in eV) for the peak responsivity for each of the photoreceptors in
the eye (one rod and three cones).
b. Various experiments (the most well known being by Hecht et al., J. Opt. Soc. America, 38, 196,
1942) have tested the threshold sensitivity of the dark-adapted eye and have estimated that visual
perception requires a minimum of roughly 90 photons to be incident onto the cornea in front of
the eye’s pupil and within 1∕10 second. Taking 90 incident photons every 100 ms as the threshold sensitivity, calculate the total photon flux (photons per second), total energy in eV (within
100 ms), and the optical power that is needed for threshold visual perception.
c. Not all photons incident on the eye make it to the actual photoreceptors in the retina. It has been
estimated that only 1 in 10 photons arriving at the eye’s cornea actually make it to rod photoreceptors, due to various reflections and absorptions in the eye and other loss mechanisms. Thus,
only nine photons make it to photoreceptors on the retina.23 It is estimated that the nine test
photons fall randomly onto a circular area of about 0.0025 mm2. What is the estimated threshold
intensity for visual perception? If there are 150,000 rods mm−2 in this area of the eye, estimate
the number of rods in this test spot. If there are a large number of rods, more than 100 in this
spot, then it is likely that no single rod receives more than one photon since the nine photons
arrive randomly. Thus, a rod must be able to sense a single photon, but it takes nine excited
rods, somehow summed up by the visual system, to generate the visual sensation. Do you agree
with the latter conclusion?
d. It is estimated that at least 200,000 photons per second must be incident on the eye to generate
a color sensation by exciting the cones. Assuming that this occurs at the peak sensitivity at 555 nm,
and that as in part (b) only about 10 percent of the photons make it to the retina, estimate the
threshold optical power stimulating the cones in the retina.

3.7

X-ray photons In chest radiology, a patient’s chest is exposed to X-rays, and the X-rays passing
through the patient are recorded on a photographic film to generate an X-ray image of the chest for
medical diagnosis. The average wavelength of X-rays in chest radiology is about 0.2 Å (0.02 nm).
Numerous measurements indicate that the patient, on average, is exposed to a total radiation energy
per unit area of roughly 0.1 μJ cm−2 for one chest X-ray image. Find the photon energy used in chest
radiology, and the average number of photons incident on the patient per unit area (per cm2).

*3.8

X-rays, exposure, and roentgens X-rays are widely used in many applications such as medical
imaging, security scans, X-ray diffraction studies of crystals, and for examining defects such as cracks
in objects and structures. X-rays are highly energetic photons that can easily penetrate and pass
through various objects. Different materials attenuate X-rays differently, so when X-rays are passed
through an object, the emerging X-rays can be recorded on a photographic film, or be captured by a
modern flat panel X-ray image detector, to generate an X-ray image of the interior of the object; this
is called radiography. X-rays also cause ionization in a medium and hence are known as ionization
radiation. The amount of exposure (denoted by X) to X-rays, ionizing radiation, is measured in terms

23

Sometimes one comes across a statement that the eye can detect a single photon. While a rod photoreceptor
can indeed sense a single photon (or, put differently, a photon can activate a single rod), the overall human
visual perception needs roughly nine photons at around 507 nm to consciously register a visual sensation.

two fundamental principles we can apply: conservation of linear momentum (along the x direction

eliminate the unmeasurable angle ϕ. Let pe be the momentum of the electron after the collision along

Compton’s original experiment in 1923 is schematically shown in Figure 3.51a. The X-ray generated from an X-ray tube with a characteristic wavelength 0.0709 nm impinged on a carbon target.
The wavelength of the scattered X-rays was measured using a rotating crystal X-ray spectrometer. The
spectrometer is based on the fact that incident X-rays with only certain wavelengths and at certain
angles satisfying the Bragg diffraction condition can be diffracted, that is, the scattered X-ray wavelength λ′ must satisfy 2d sin α = λ′, where d is the separation between the atomic planes involved
in diffraction, and α is the angle between the planes and the incident X-rays. If we use a crystal with
a known structure, and that is known separation d between the atomic planes, then by rotating the
crystal we can bring the required angle α into diffraction and measure the wavelength λ′. Typical
results on the X-ray intensity versus wavelength are shown in Figure 3.51b. Table 3.6 summarizes

Planck’s law and photon energy distribution of radiation Planck’s law, stated in Equation 3.9,
provides the spectral distribution of the black body radiation intensity in terms of wavelength through

frequency range f to f + df (dλ and df have opposite signs since f increases as λ decreases.) The

as If df where If is the radiation intensity per unit frequency. Thus,

find ∣dλ∕df ∣ to find If from the preceding expression.

Equation 3.81 is written to highlight that it is a function of the photon energy hf, which is in
joules in Equation 3.81 but can be converted to eV by dividing by 1.6 × 10−19 J eV−1.
If we integrate If over all photon energies (numerically on a calculator or a computer from 0 to
say 6 eV), we would obtain the total intensity at a temperature T. Find the total intensity IT
emitted at T = 2700 K (a typical incandescent light bulb filament temperature) and at 6000 K
(roughly representing the sun’s spectrum). If x is photon energy in eV, then ex = hf and edx = hdf
must be used in the integration of Equation 3.81. Plot y = If ∕IT versus the photon energy in eV.
What are the photon energies for the peaks in the distributions? Calculate the corresponding
wavelength for each using λ = c∕f and then compare these wavelengths with those predicted by
Wien’s law, λmaxT ≈ 2.89 × 10−3 m K.

3.14

Wien’s law The maximum in the intensity distribution of black body radiation depends on the
temperature. Substitute x = λkT∕(hc) in Planck’s law in Equation 3.9 and plot Iλ versus x and find
λmax which corresponds to the peak of the distribution, and hence derive Wien’s law. Find the peak
intensity wavelength λmax for a 40 W light bulb given that its filament operates at roughly 2400 °C.

Stefan’s law Consider a 40 W, 120 V incandescent light bulb. The tungsten filament is 0.381 m
long and has a diameter of 33 μm. Its resistivity at room temperature is 5.51 × 10−8 Ω m. Given that
the resistivity of the tungsten varies at ρ ∝ T 1.24 and the typical emissivity of a tungsten surface is
0.35, estimate the temperature of the filament when it is operated at the rated voltage, that is, when
it is lit directly from a power outlet.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
3.16

Electron diffraction and the sample thickness When an energetic electron enters a medium, it is
slowed down by its interactions with the host atoms. The electron dissipates its energy and, if the
medium is sufficiently thick, the electron is eventually stopped within the medium. For example, the
maximum range of a 500 keV electron in an Al sample is roughly 0.44 cm, whereas it is 0.11 mm
at 50 keV and 0.94 μm at 5 keV electron energy. What should be the sample thickness in typical
electron diffraction experiments in which the anode voltage is 10 kV? (Consider a power law dependence.) Consider electron diffraction experiments with the anode voltage at 10 kV. The Al foil to
screen distance is 18.2 cm. The first four diffraction rings (Figure 3.14b) have the diameters 19.6
mm, 23.0 mm, 32.4 mm, and 38.0 mm on the screen and correspond to the set of planes (111), (200),
(220), and (311), respectively. Al is an FCC crystal with a lattice parameter a = 0.4049 nm. The
diffraction angle is 2θ. (See Appendix A.) Plot sin θ against (h2 + k2 + l2)1∕2. (Note that (hkl) represent the Miller indices of planes in a crystal as explained in Chapter 1.) Find the best line and its
slope. Use the slope of this line to find the wavelength of the electron and compare it with that from
the de Broglie relationship.

*3.17

Electron microscope Diffraction of light by an object becomes important when the wavelength of
light is comparable to the object we wish to see. The resolution of an optical microscope cannot
therefore be better than the wavelength of visible light, on the order of 500 nm. An electron microscope uses an electron beam (just like light) to “see” small objects because we can make the wavelength of an electron beam very short by adjusting the accelerating voltage. The transmission electron
microscope (TEM) is an equipment that allows examining thin slices (or films) of materials under
very large magnifications, for example 100,000× or more. As depicted in Figure 3.52, the image
formation is exactly the same as that in the optical microscope except that electromagnetic coils acting as electron lenses are used to bend the electron ray. Electrons emitted by the hot cathode are
accelerated by the anode, which has typically a large voltage such as 100 kV applied to it with respect
to the cathode. After passing through the anode, the electrons are collimated into a parallel beam by
the condenser lens to be transmitted through the thin sample. An objective lens focuses the transmitted

The samples are typically less than 100 nm thick.
a. Do you need the wave properties of the electron to explain the operation of the electron microscope? (Explain your answer and consider whether you need interference and diffraction of waves
to explain the optical microscope.)
b. If the operating voltage of a transmission electron microscope is 100 kV, what is velocity of the
electrons and their wavelength? (Neglect relativistic effects.)
c.

Diffraction effects are negligible when the size of the object d is much greater than the wavelength λ of the wave. For example, the Bragg diffraction condition has no solutions when 2d > λ.
Resolution is therefore comparable in magnitude to the wavelength λ. What is the theoretical
resolution, in order of magnitude, of the electron microscope operating at 100 kV and 300 kV?
What do you think limits the resolution in practice?

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle Show that if the uncertainty in the position of a particle is on
the order of its de Broglie wavelength, then the uncertainty in its momentum is about the same as

3.20

Infinite and finite potential energy well First consider an infinite one-dimensional PE well of
width 1 nm. Calculate the energies of the first three levels. Consider a finite PE well with the same
width (1 nm). The height of the barrier is 2.0 eV. There are only three energy levels E1 = 0.23 eV,
E2 = 0.89 eV, and E3 = 1.81 eV. Are the finite PE well levels higher or lower than the corresponding infinite well levels? Find the electron penetration depth into the barrier for each of the three energy
levels. What is your conclusion?

*3.21

Finite potential energy well Figure 3.17b shows the allowed wavefunctions ψ1(x), ψ2(x), and ψ3(x) for
the finite potential well. We know that there is a center of symmetry at x = a∕2. Thus, ψ(x) must reflect
this symmetry and are either even or odd functions. Therefore, in region II in Figure 3.17a, we have two
types of possible solutions corresponding to cosine and sine functions about the center of symmetry
1
ψ II (x) = A cos k(x − a)
2

or

1
ψ II (x) = B sin k(x − a)
2

where A and B are constants. Both satisfy the Schrödinger equation in II. Further, in region III, the
wavefunction decays with distance and we can write it as ψ III(x) = C2exp(−αx) = C3exp[−α(x–a)],
where C3 is a new constant. Use the boundary condition that at x = a (a) ψ II(a) = ψ III(a) and
(b) dψII∕dx = dψIII∕dx to show that k and α are related by
1
α = k tan( ka)
2

or

1
α = −k cot( ka)
2

What would happen if you were to use the boundary conditions at x = 0? Since α and k are related
to the energy E, we can solve the above to find the energy of the electron. To solve α = k tan( 21 ka),
we need to plot α and k tan( 21 ka) as a function of energy and find the intersection points of the two
curves; and similarly for the case α = −k cot( 12 ka) . Using a graphical solution find the energy levels
in a finite potential energy well of height 0.4 eV and width 4 nm. What is your conclusion?

to R as a or Vo or both become very large?
b. For a wide barrier (αa ≫ 1) , show that To can at most be 4 and that To = 4 when E = 12 Vo .

b. Suppose that we wish to find the total number, that is, the sum S, of all wavefunctions with

x, y, z, and we take n1 along x, n2 along y, and n3 along z. N′2 = n′21 + n′22 + n′23 = ε′ represents
those n1, n2, n3 values that give ε′. What is x2 + y2 + z2 = ε′ in this n-space space? What does
the volume of space in this sphere located so that x, y, and z are all positive represent? This

Line spectra of hydrogenic atoms Spectra of hydrogen-like atoms are classified in terms of electron transitions to a common lower energy level.
a. All transitions from energy levels n = 2, 3, . . . to n = 1 (the K shell) are labeled K lines and
constitute the Lyman series. The spectral line corresponding to the smallest energy difference
(n = 2 to n = 1) is labeled the Kα line, next is labeled Kβ, and so on. The transition from n = ∞
to n = 1 has the largest energy difference and defines the greatest photon energy (shortest
wavelength) in the K series; hence it is called the absorption edge Kαe. What is the range of
wavelengths for the K lines? What is Kαe? Where are these lines with respect to the visible
spectrum?
b. All transitions from energy levels n = 3, 4, . . . to n = 2 (L shell) are labeled L lines and constitute the Balmer series. What is the range of wavelengths for the L lines (i.e., Lα and Lαe)?
Are these in the visible range?
c. All transitions from energy levels n = 4, 5, . . . to n = 3 (M shell) are labeled M lines and

EI,n = (Zeffective∕n)2 (13.6 eV) in Equation 3.59. The third ionization energy represents removing
an electron from Li2+ to form Li3+. This energy is 122.5 eV. What is Zeffective in Li2+? What is

X-rays and the Moseley relation X-rays are photons with wavelengths in the range 0.01–10 nm,
with typical energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. When an electron transition occurs in an atom
from the L to the K shell, the emitted radiation is generally in the X-ray spectrum. For all atoms with
atomic number Z > 2, the K shell is full. Suppose that one of the electrons in the K shell has been
knocked out by an energetic projectile electron impacting the atom (the projectile electron would have
been accelerated by a large voltage difference). The resulting vacancy in the K shell can then be filled
by an electron in the L shell transiting down and emitting a photon. The emission resulting from the
L to K shell transition is labeled the Kα line. The Table 3.8 shows the Kα line data obtained for
various materials.

experimental value of −79 eV? How strong is the electron–electron repulsion energy?
3.30

Excitation energy of He In the HeNe laser, an energetic electron is accelerated by the applied field
impacts and excites the He from its ground state, 1s2, to an excited state He*, 1s12s1, which has one
of the electrons in the 2s orbital. The ground energy of the He atom is −79 eV with respect to both
electrons isolated at infinity, which defines the zero energy. Consider the 1s12s1 state. If we neglect
the electron–electron interactions, we can calculate the energy of the 1s and 2s electrons using the
energy for a hydrogenic atom, En = −(Z 2∕n2)(13.6 eV). We can then add the electron–electron interaction energy by assuming that the 1s and 2s electrons are effectively separated by 3ao, which is the
difference, 4ao − 1ao, between the 1s and 2s Bohr radii. Calculate the overall energy of He* and hence
the excitation energy from He to He*. The experimental value is about 20.6 eV.

Electron affinity The fluorine atom has the electronic configuration [He]2s2p5. The F atom can
actually capture an electron to become a F− ion, and release energy, which is listed as its electron
affinity, 328 kJ mol−1. We will assume that the two 1s electrons in the closed K shell (very close to
the nucleus) and the two electrons in the 2s orbitals will shield four positive charges and thereby
expose +9e − 4e = +5e for the 2p orbital. Suppose that we try to calculate the energy of the F− ion
by simply assuming that the additional electron is attracted by an effective positive charge, +e(5 −
Z2p) or +eZeffective, where Z2p is the overall shielding effect of the five electrons in the 2p orbital, so
that the tenth electron we have added sees an effective charge of +eZeffective. Calculate Z2p and Zeffective.
The F atom does not enjoy losing an electron. The ionization energy of the F atom is 1681 kJ mol−1.
What is the Zeffective that is experienced by a 2p electron? (Note: 1 kJ mol−1 = 0.01036 eV∕atom.)

Electron spin resonance (ESR) It is customary to write the spin magnetic moment of an electron as
μspin = −

where S is the spin angular momentum, and g is a numerical factor, called the g factor, which is 2
for a free electron. Consider the interaction of an electron’s spin with an external magnetic field.
Show that the additional potential energy EBS is given by
EBS = βgmsB
where β = eħ∕2me is called the Bohr magneton. Frequently electron spin resonance is used to
examine various defects and impurities in semiconductors. A defect such as a dangling bond, for
example, will have a single unpaired electron in an orbital and thus will possess a spin magnetic
moment. A strong magnetic field is applied to the specimen to split the energy level E1 of the unpaired
spin to two levels E1 − EBS and E1 + EBS, separated by ΔEBS. The electron occupies the lower level
E1 − EBS. Electromagnetic waves (usually in the microwave range) of known frequency f, and hence
of known photon energy hf, are passed through the specimen. The magnetic field B is varied until
the EM waves are absorbed by the specimen, which corresponds to the excitation of the electron at
each defect from E1 − EBS to E1 + EBS, that is, hf = ΔEBS at a certain field B. This maximum absorption condition is called electron spin resonance, as the electron’s spin is made to resonate with the
EM wave. If B = 2 T, calculate the frequency of the EM waves needed for ESR, taking g = 2. Note:
For many molecules, and impurities and defects in crystals, g is not exactly 2, because the electron
is in a different environment in each case. The experimentally measured value of g can be used to
characterize molecules, impurities, and defects.
3.33

Spin–orbit coupling An electron in an atom will experience an internal magnetic field Bint because,
from the electron’s reference frame, it is the positive nucleus that is orbiting the electron. The electron
will “see” the nucleus, take as charge +e, circling around it, which is equivalent to a current I = +ef
where f is the electron’s frequency of rotation around the nucleus. The current I generates the internal
magnetic field Bint at the electron. From electromagnetism texts, Bint is given by

Consider the hydrogen atom with Z = 1, 2p orbital, n = 2, ℓ = 1, and take r ≈ n2ao. Calculate Bint.
The electron’s spin magnetic moment μspin will couple with this internal field, which means that
the electron will now possess a magnetic potential energy ESL that is due to the coupling of the spin
with the orbital motion, called spin-orbit coupling. ESL will be either negative or positive, with only
two values, depending on whether the electron’s spin magnetic moment is along or opposite Bint, Take
z along Bint so that ESL = −Bint μspin,z, where μspin,z is μspin along z, and then show that the energy E2

useful.) What is the effect of ESL on the observed emission spectrum from the H-atom transition from
2p to 1s? What is the separation of the two wavelengths? The observation is called fine structure

1.2 eV. Using reasonable arguments match these energies to the states a to e. Use Hund’s rule to
establish the ground state with 0 eV. If you have to flip a spin to go from the ground to another
configuration, that would cost energy. If you have to move an electron from a lower s to p or from
p to a higher s, that would cost a lot of energy. Two electrons in the same orbital (obviously with
paired electrons) would have substantial Coulombic repulsion energy.

Er3+-doped fiber amplifier Er3+-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) was first reported in 1987 by E.
Desurvire, J. R. Simpson, and P. C. Becker and, within a short period, AT&T began deploying EDFA
repeaters in long-haul fiber communications in 1994. They are now routinely used in optical amplification at 1550 nm. When the Er3+ ion in an EDFA is pumped with 980 nm of radiation, the Er3+
ions absorb energy from the pump signal and become excited to E3 (Figure 3.48). Later the Er3+ ions
at E2 are stimulated to add energy (coherent photons) to the signal at 1550 nm. What is the wasted
energy (in eV) from the pump to the signal at each photon amplification step? (This energy is lost
as heat in the glass medium.) The Er3+ ions at E2 on average take 10 ms to spontaneously decay from
E2 down to E1. This is called the spontaneous emission time τsp. An Er-doped fiber amplifier is
10 m long, and the radius of the core is 5 μm. The Er3+ concentration in the core is 1019 cm−3. The
nominal power gain of the amplifier is 100 (or 20 dB). The pump wavelength is 980 nm, and the signal
wavelength is 1550 nm. If the output power from the amplifier is 100 mW and assuming the signal
and pump are confined to the core, what is the minimum intensity of the pump signal? How much
power is wasted in this EDFA? (The pump must provide enough photons to pump the Er3+ ions needed
to generate the additional output photons over that of input photons. Further, the pump must provide
sufficient photon flux to be able to excite Er3+ ions from E1 to E3 and hence to E2 within a time
scale much less than τsp; otherwise we cannot achieve population inversion.

Modern Theory of Solids

One of the great successes of modern physics has been the application of quantum
mechanics or the Schrödinger equation to the behavior of molecules and solids. For
example, quantum mechanics explains the nature of the bond between atoms, and its
consequences. How can carbon bond with four other carbon atoms? What determines
the direction and strength of a bond? An intuitively obvious outcome from quantum
mechanics is that the energy of the electron is still quantized in the molecule. In
addition, the application of quantum mechanics to many atoms, as in a solid, leads
to energy bands within which the electron energy levels are almost continuous. The
electron energy falls within possible values in a band of energies. It is nearly impossible to comprehend the principles of operation of modern solid-state electronic
devices without a good grasp of the band theory of solids. Since we are dealing with
a large number of electrons in the solid, we must consider a statistical way of describing their behavior, just as we use the Maxwell distribution of velocities to explain
the behavior of gas atoms. An equally important question, therefore, is “What is the
probability that an electron is in a state with energy E within an energy band?”

hydrogen molecule. This is the H–H (or H2) system. Let us examine the energy
levels of the H–H system as a function of the interatomic distance R. When the
atoms are infinitely separated, each atom has its own set of energy levels, labeled
1s, 2s, 2p, etc. The electron energy in each atom is −13.6 eV with respect to the
“free” state (electron infinitely separated from the parent nucleus). The energy of
the two isolated hydrogen atoms is twice −13.6 eV.

MODERN THEORY OF SOLIDS

As the atoms approach closer, the electrons interact both with each other and
with the other nuclei. To obtain the wavefunctions and the new energy of the electrons, we need to find the new potential energy function PE for the electrons in this
new environment and then solve the Schrödinger equation with this new PE function.
The new energy is actually lower than twice −13.6 eV, which means that the H2
formation is energetically favorable.
The bond formation between two H atoms can be easily explained by describing
the behavior of the electron within the molecule. We use a molecular orbital ψ,
which depends on the interaction of individual atomic wavefunctions and is regarded
as an electron wavefunction within the molecule.
In the H2 molecule, we cannot have two sets of identical atomic ψ1s orbitals, for
two reasons. First, this would violate the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires
that, in a given system of electrons (those within the H2 molecule), we cannot have
two sets of identical quantum numbers. When the atoms were separated, we did not
have this problem, because we had two isolated systems.
Second, as the two atoms approach each other, as shown in Figure 4.1, the
atomic ψ1s wavefunctions overlap. This overlap produces two new wavefunctions
with different energies and hence different quantum numbers. When the two atomic
wavefunctions interfere, they can overlap either in phase (both positive or both negative)

or out of phase (one positive and the other negative), as a result of which two
molecular orbitals are formed. These are conventionally labeled ψσ and ψσ* as illustrated in Figure 4.1. Thus, two of the molecular orbitals in the H–H system are
ψσ = ψ1s(rA) + ψ1s(rB)

[4.1]

ψσ* = ψ1s(rA) − ψ1s(rB)

[4.2]

where the two hydrogen atoms are labeled A and B, and rA and rB are the respective
distances of the electrons from their parent nucleus. In generating two separate
molecular orbitals ψσ and ψσ* from a linear combination of two identical atomic orbitals ψ1s, we have used the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method.
The first molecular orbital ψσ is symmetric and has considerable magnitude
between the nuclei, whereas the second ψσ*, is antisymmetric and has a node between
the nuclei. The resulting electron probability distributions ∣ψσ∣2 and ∣ψσ*∣2 are shown
in Figure 4.2.
In an analogy to hydrogenic wavefunctions, since ψσ* has a node, we would
expect it to have a higher energy than the ψσ orbital and therefore a different energy
quantum number, which means that the Pauli exclusion principle is no longer violated. We can also expect that because ∣ψσ∣2 has an appreciable electron concentration
between the two nuclei, the electrostatic PE, and hence the total energy for the
wavefunction ψσ, will be lower than that for ψσ*, as well as those for the individual
atomic wavefunctions.
Of course, the true wavefunctions of the electrons in the H2 system must be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation, but an intelligent guess is that these must
look like ψσ and ψσ*. We can therefore use ψσ and ψσ* in the Schrödinger equation,
with the correct form of the PE term V, to evaluate the energies Eσ and Eσ* of ψσ and
ψσ*, respectively, as a function of R. The PE function V in the H–H system has positive PE contributions arising from electron–electron repulsions and proton–proton

repulsions, but negative PE contributions arising from the attractions of the two
electrons to the two protons.
The two energies, Eσ and Eσ*, are widely different, with Eσ below E1s and Eσ*
above E1s, as shown schematically in Figure 4.3a. As R decreases and the two
H atoms get closer, the energy of the ψσ orbital state passes through a minimum at
R = a. Each orbital state can hold two electrons with spins paired, and within the
two hydrogen atoms, we have two electrons. If these enter the ψσ orbital and pair
their spins, then this new configuration is energetically more favorable than two
isolated H atoms. It corresponds to the hydrogen molecule H2. The energy difference
between that of the two isolated H atoms and the Eσ minimum energy at R = a is
the bonding energy, as illustrated in Figure 4.3a. When the two electrons in the H2
molecule occupy the ψσ orbital, their probability distribution (and hence, the negative
charge distribution) is such that the negative PE, arising from the attractions of these
two electrons to the two protons, is stronger in magnitude than the positive PE, arising from electron–electron repulsions and proton–proton repulsions and the kinetic
energy of the two electrons. Therefore, the H2 molecule is energetically stable.
The wavefunction ψσ corresponding to the lowest electron energy is called the
bonding orbital, and ψσ* is the antibonding orbital. When two atoms are brought
together, the two identical atomic wavefunctions combine in two ways to generate
two different molecular orbitals, each with a different energy. Effectively, then, an

atomic energy level, such as E1s, splits into two, Eσ and Eσ*. The splitting is due to
the interaction (or overlap) between the atomic orbitals. Figure 4.3b schematically
illustrates the changes in the electron energy levels as two isolated H atoms are
brought together to form the H2 molecule.
The splitting of a one-atom energy level when a molecule is formed is analogous
to the splitting of the resonant frequency in an RLC circuit when two such circuits
are brought together and coupled. Consider the RLC circuit shown in Figure 4.4a.
The circuit is excited by an ac voltage source. The current peaks at the resonant
frequency ω0, as indicated in Figure 4.4a. When two such identical RLC circuits are
coupled together and driven by an ac voltage source, the current develops two peaks,
at frequencies ω1 and ω2, below and above ω0, as illustrated in Figure 4.4b. The two
peaks at ω1 and ω2 are due to the mutual inductance that couples the two circuits,
allowing them to interact. From this analogy, we can intuitively accept the energy
splitting observed in Figure 4.3a.
Consider what happens when two He atoms come together. Recall that the 1s
orbital has paired electrons and is full. The 1s atomic energy level will again split
into two levels, Eσ and Eσ*, associated with the molecular orbitals ψσ and ψσ*, as
illustrated in Figure 4.5. However, in the He–He system, there are four electrons, so
two occupy the ψσ orbital state and two go to the ψσ* orbital state. Consequently, the
system energy is not lowered by bringing the two He atoms closer. Furthermore,
quantum mechanical calculations show that the antibonding energy level Eσ* shifts
higher than the bonding level Eσ shifts lower. By the same token, although we could
put an additional electron at Eσ* in H2 to make H−2 , we could not make H2−
2 by placing two electrons at Eσ*.
From the He–He example, we can conclude that, as a general rule, the overlap
of full atomic orbital states does not lead to bonding. In fact, full orbitals repel each
other, because any overlap results in an increase in the system energy. To form a

bond between two atoms, we essentially need an overlap of half-occupied orbitals,
as in the H2 molecule.

EXAMPLE 4.1

HYDROGEN HALIDE MOLECULE (HF) We already know that H has a half-occupied 1s
orbital, which can take part in bonding. Since the F atom has the electronic structure 1s22s2p5,
two of the p orbitals are full and one p orbital, px, is half full. This means that only the px
orbital can participate in bonding. Figure 4.6 shows the electron orbitals in both H and F.
When the H atom and the F atom approach each other to form an HF molecule, the ψ1s
orbital of H overlaps the px orbital of F. There are two possibilities for the overlap. First,
ψ1s and px can overlap in phase (both positive or both negative), to give a ψσ orbital that
does not have a node between H and F, as shown in Figure 4.6. Second, they can overlap
out of phase (one positive and the other negative), so that the overlap orbital ψσ* has a node
(similar to ψσ* in Figure 4.1). We know from hydrogen atomic wavefunctions in Chapter 3
that orbitals with more nodes have higher energies. The molecular orbital ψσ therefore corresponds to a bonding orbital with a lower energy than the ψσ* orbital. The two electrons,
one from ψls and the other from px, enter the ψσ orbital with spins paired, thereby forming
a bond between H and F.

BAND THEORY OF SOLIDS

BAND THEORY OF SOLIDS

4.2.1 ENERGY BAND FORMATION
When we bring three hydrogen atoms (labeled A, B, and C) together, we generate
three separate molecular orbital states, ψa, ψb, and ψc, from three ψ1s atomic states.
Again, this occurs in three different ways, as illustrated in Figure 4.7a. As in the
case of the H2 molecule, each molecular orbital must be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to center atom B. The reason is that the molecule A–B–C in
which A, B, and C are identical atoms, is symmetric with respect to B. Thus, each
wavefunction must be either symmetric or antisymmetric, that it must have even or
odd parity.1 The orbitals that satisfy even and odd requirements are
ψa = ψ1s(A) + ψ1s(B) + ψ1s(C)

[4.3a]

ψb = ψ1s(A) − ψ1s(C)

[4.3b]

ψc = ψ1s(A) − ψ1s(B) + ψ1s(C)

[4.3c]

where ψ1s(A), ψ1s(B), and ψ1s(C) are the 1s atomic wavefunctions centered around
the atoms A, B, and C, respectively, as shown in Figure 4.7a. For example, the
wavefunction ψ1s(A) represents ψ1s(rA), which is centered around A and has the form
exp(−rA∕ao), where rA is the distance from the nucleus of A, and ao is the Bohr
radius. Notice that ψ1s(B) is missing in Equation 4.3b, so ψb is antisymmetric.
The energies Ea, Eb, and Ec of ψa, ψb, and ψc can be calculated from the
Schrödinger equation by using the PE function of this system (the PE also includes
proton–proton repulsions). It is clear that since ψa, ψb, and ψc are different, their
energies Ea, Eb, and Ec are also different. Consequently, the 1s energy level splits
into three separate levels, corresponding to the energies of ψa, ψb, and ψc, as depicted
by Figure 4.7b. By analogy with the electron wavefunctions in the hydrogen atom,
we can argue that if the molecular wavefunction has more nodes, its energy is higher.
Thus, ψa has the lowest energy Ea, ψb has the next higher energy Eb, and ψc has the
highest energy Ec, as shown in Figure 4.7b. There are three electrons in the threehydrogen system. The first two pair their spins and enter orbital ψa at energy Ea, and
the third enters orbital ψb at energy Eb. Comparing Figures 4.7 and 4.3, we notice
that although H2 and H3 both have two electrons in the lowest energy level, H3 also
has an extra electron at the higher energy level (Eb), which tends to increase the net
energy of the atom. Thus, the H3 molecule is much less stable than the H2 molecule.2
Now consider the formation of a solid. Take N Li (lithium) atoms from infinity
and bring them together to form the Li metal. Lithium has the electronic configuration 1s22s1, which is somewhat like the hydrogen atom, since the K shell is closed
and the third electron is alone in the 2s orbital.
Based on our previous discussions, we assume that the atomic energy levels will
split into N separate energy levels. Since the 1s subshell is full and is close to the
1
We saw in Chapter 3 that the wavefunctions of an electron in a 1D PE well were either symmetric or antisymmetric.
Whenever the potential energy V in the Schrödinger equation has a point of symmetry, the wavefunctions are
symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this point.

nucleus, it will not be affected much by the interatomic interactions; consequently,
the energy of this state will experience only negligible splitting, if any. Since the 1s
electrons will stay close to their parent nuclei, we will not consider them during
formation of the solid.
In the system of N isolated Li atoms, we have N electrons in N ψ2s orbitals at
the energy E2s, as illustrated in Figure 4.8 (at infinite interatomic separation). Let us
assume that N is large (typically, ∼1023). As N atoms are brought together to form
the solid, the energy level at E2s splits into N finely separated energy levels. The
maximum width of the energy splitting depends on the closest interatomic distance
a in the solid, as apparent in Figure 4.3a. The atoms separated by a distance greater
than R = a give rise to a lesser amount of energy splitting. The interatomic interactions between N ψ2s orbitals thus spread the N energy levels between the bottom and
top levels, EB and ET, respectively, which are determined by the closest interatomic
distance a. Put differently, EB and ET are determined by the distance between nearest neighbors. It is obvious that with N very large, the energy separation between
two consecutive energy levels is very small; indeed, it is almost infinitesimal and
not as exaggerated as in Figure 4.8.
Remember that each energy level Ei in the Li metal of Figure 4.8 is the energy
of an electron wavefunction ψsolid(i) in the solid, where ψsolid(i) is one particular
combination of the N atomic wavefunctions ψ2s. There are N different ways to combine N atomic wavefunctions ψ2s, since each can be added in phase or out of phase,
as is apparent in Equations 4.3a to c (see also Figure 4.7a and b). For example, when
all N ψ2s are summed in phase, the resulting wavefunction ψsolid(1) is like ψa in Equation 4.3a, and it has the lowest energy. On the other hand, when N ψ2s are summed
with alternating phases, + − + . . . , the resulting wavefunction ψsolid(N) is like ψc,

Figure 4.8 The formation of a 2s energy band from the 2s orbitals when N Li atoms
come together to form the Li solid.
There are N 2s electrons, but 2N states in the band. The 2s band is therefore only half full.
The atomic 1s orbital is close to the Li nucleus and remains undisturbed in the solid. Thus,
each Li atom has a closed K shell (full 1s orbital).

and it has the highest energy. Other combinations of ψ2s give rise to different energy
values between EB and ET.
The single 2s energy level E2s therefore splits into N (∼1023) finely separated
energy levels, forming an energy band, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. Consequently,
there are N separate energy levels, each of which can take two electrons with opposite spins. The N electrons fill all the levels up to and including the level at N∕2.
Therefore, the band is half full. We do not mean literally that the band is full to the
half-energy point. The levels are not spread equally over the band from EB to ET,
which means that the band cannot be full to the half-energy point. Half filled simply
means half the states in the band are filled from the bottom up.
We have generated a half-filled band from a half-filled isolated 2s energy level. The
energy band resulting from the splitting of the atomic 2s energy level is loosely termed
the 2s band. By the same token, the atomic 1s levels are full, so any 1s band that
forms from these 1s states will also be full. We can get an idea of the separation of
energy levels in the 2s band by noting that the maximum separation, ET − EB, between
the top and bottom of the band is on the order of 10 eV, but there are some 1023
atoms, giving rise to 1023 energy levels between EB and ET. Thus, the energy levels
are finely separated, forming, for all practical purposes, a continuum of energy levels.
The 2p energy level, as well as the higher levels at 3s and so on, also split into
finely separated energy levels, as shown in Figure 4.9. In fact, some of these energy
levels overlap the 2s band; hence, they provide further energy levels and “extend”
the 2s band into higher energy levels, as indicated in Figure 4.10, which shows how
energy bands in metals are often represented. The vertical axis is the electron energy.
The top of the 2s band, which is half full, overlaps the bottom of the 2p band, which
itself is overlapped near the top by the 3s band. We therefore have a band of energies

that stretches from the bottom of the 2s band all the way to the vacuum level, as
depicted in Figure 4.11. The reader may wonder what happened to the 3d, 4s, etc.,
bands. The energies of these bands (including the top portion of the 3s band) are
normally above the vacuum level. However, this does not mean that an electron
within the bulk of the crystal cannot be given an energy higher than the vacuum
level, as discussed later in this section.
At a temperature of absolute zero, or nearly so, the thermal energy is insufficient
to excite the electrons to higher energy levels, so all the electrons pair their spins
and fill each energy level from EB up to an energy level EFO that we call the Fermi
level at 0 K, as shown in Figure 4.11. The energy value for the Fermi level depends
on where we take the reference energy. For example, if we take the vacuum level as
the zero reference, then for the Li metal, EFO is at –2.5 eV. The Fermi level is normally measured with respect to the bottom of the band, in which case, it is simply
termed the Fermi energy and denoted EFO. For the Li metal, EFO is 4.7 eV, which is
with respect to the bottom of the band. The Fermi level has considerable significance, as we will discover later in this chapter.

At absolute zero, all the energy levels up to the Fermi level are full. The energy
required to excite an electron from the Fermi level to the vacuum level, that is, to
liberate the electron from the metal, is called the work function Φ of the metal. As
the temperature increases, some of the electrons get excited to higher energy levels.
To determine the probability of finding an electron at an energy level E, we must
consider what is called “particle statistics,” a topic that is key to understanding the
behavior of electronic devices. Clearly, the probability of finding an electron at 0 K
at some energy E < EFO is unity, and at E > EFO, the probability is zero. Table 4.1
summarizes the Fermi energy and work function of a few selected metals.
The electrons in the energy band of a metal are loosely bound valence electrons
which become free in the crystal and thereby form a kind of electron gas.3 It is this
electron gas that holds the metal ions together in the crystal structure and constitutes
the metallic bond. This intuitive interpretation is shown in Figure 4.9. When solid
Li is formed from N atoms, the N electrons fill all the lower energy levels up to
N∕2. The energy of the system of N Li atoms, according to Figure 4.9, is therefore
much less than that of N isolated Li atoms by virtue of the N electrons taking up
lower energy levels. It must be emphasized that the electrons within a band do not
belong to any specific atom but to the whole solid. We cannot identify a given
3
The energy band in a metal is only partially full, and the electrons in the band are those valence electrons
donated by each metal atom. Some authors therefore call this band a valence band. But, these valence electrons
are those very electrons that contribute to electrical conduction, so the band is called a conduction band. One
convenient view is to simply consider the band as a partially filled conduction band.

electron in the band with a certain Li atom. All the 2s electrons essentially form an
electron gas and have energies that fall within the energy band. These electrons are
constantly moving around in the metal which in terms of quantum mechanics means
that their wavefunctions must be of the traveling wave type and not the type that
localizes the electron around a given atom (e.g., ψn,ℓ,mℓ in the hydrogen atom). We
can represent each electron with a wavevector k so that its momentum p is ħk.
The energy band diagram in Figure 4.11 is widely used in explaining the electrical properties of metals. However, it gives the impression that any electron inside the
metal that has an energy EFO + Φ can escape the metal; that is, an electron cannot
have an energy more than EFO + Φ inside the metal. This is not true. An electron
inside the bulk of the metal crystal is far away from the surface, and even if we impart
an energy greater than EFO + Φ, it is unlikely to find the surface of the metal and
escape. An electron inside the metal that has an energy EFO + Φ or more, can only
escape the metal into vacuum if it happens to be moving towards the surface, and
reaches the surface before it is scattered away. A better representation of the energy
band of a metal is to indicate the vacuum level on the surface only and allow the band
of energies inside the metal to extend to higher energies as in Figure 4.12. If you
examine Figure 4.9 for R = a, and ignore the vacuum level line, it is quite apparent
that the energy levels extend to higher and higher levels; these are the energies that
would be available to an electron inside the bulk of the crystal away from the surface.
When a photon of energy hf > Φ is incident on a metal crystal, it can be absorbed
by an electron at or near EF, which will be excited to a higher energy. If the electron
is moving towards the crystal surface, and it is not scattered by other electrons,
thermal vibrations of the crystal, impurities or defects, before it reaches the surface
it can be emitted out from the metal into vacuum. This light induced electron emission process is called photoemission. The electron labeled 1 in Figure 4.12 is able
to reach the surface but electron 2 cannot because it is traveling in the wrong direction, away from the surface. Electron 2 loses its excess energy (energy above EFO)
through interactions with other electrons, collisions with vibrating metal ions, impurities and crystal defects, and eventually returns back to EFO.
Figure 4.12 An electron inside the metal is
allowed to have energies more than EFO + Φ.
Suppose that we illuminate the metal with photons
and the photon energy hf > Φ. When an electron
at EFO absorbs a photon, it is excited to a higher
energy level above EFO + Φ. Electron 1 is traveling
towards and 2 away from the surface. Electron 1 is
able to reach the surface without being scattered
and has sufficient energy to escape the metal into
vacuum. Electron 2 however is scattered by other
electrons, lattice vibrations, impurities, and crystal
defects; loses its excess energy and returns back
to EFO.

4.2.2 PROPERTIES OF ELECTRONS IN A BAND
Since the electrons inside the metal crystal are considered to be “free,” their energy
is KE. These electrons occupy all the energy levels up to EFO as shown in the band
diagram of Figure 4.13a. The energy E of an electron in a metal increases with its
momentum p as p2∕2me. Figure 4.13b shows the energy versus momentum behavior
of the electrons in a hypothetical one-dimensional (1D) crystal. The energy increases
with momentum whether the electron is moving toward the left or right. Electrons
take on all available momentum values until their energy reaches EFO. For every
electron that is moving right (such as a), there is another (such as b) with the same
energy but moving left with the same magnitude of momentum. Thus, the average
momentum is zero and there is no net current.
Consider what happens when an electric field Ex is applied in the −x direction.
The electron a at the Fermi level and moving along in the +x direction experiences
a force eEx along the same direction. It therefore accelerates and gains momentum
and hence has energy as shown in Figure 4.13c. (The actual energy gained from the
field is very small compared with EFO, so Figure 4.13c is highly exaggerated.) The
electron a at EFO can move to higher energy levels because these adjacent higher
levels are empty. The momentum state vacated by a is filled by the electron immediately below which now gains energy and moves up, and so on. An electron that is
moving in the −x direction, however, is decelerated (its momentum decreases) and
hence loses energy as indicated by b moving to b′ in Figure 4.13c. The electrons
that are moving in the +x direction gain energy, and those that are moving in the
−x direction, lose energy. The whole electron momentum distribution therefore shifts
in the +x direction as in Figure 4.13c. Eventually the electron a, now at a′, is scattered by a lattice vibration. Typically lattice vibrations have small energies but substantial momentum. The scattered electron must find an unoccupied momentum state
with roughly the same energy, and it must change its momentum substantially. The

electron at a′ is therefore scattered to an empty state around EFO but with a momentum in the opposite direction. Its momentum is flipped as shown in Figure 4.13c.
The average momentum of the electrons is no longer zero but finite in the +x direction. Consequently there is a current flow in the −x direction, along the field, as
determined by this average momentum pav. Notice that a moves up to a′ and b falls
down to b′. Under steady-state conduction, lattice scattering simply replenishes the
electrons at b′ from a′. Notice that for energies below b′, for every electron moving
right there is another moving left with the same momentum magnitude that cancels
it. Thus, electrons below the b′ energy level do not contribute to conduction and are
excluded from further consideration. Notice that electrons above the b′ level are only
moving right and their momenta are not canceled. Thus, the conductivity is determined by the electrons in the energy range ΔE from b′ to a′ about the Fermi level
as shown in Figure 4.13c. Further, as the energy change from a to a′ is orders of
magnitude smaller than EFO, we can summarize that conduction occurs by the drift
of electrons at the Fermi level.4 (If we were to calculate ΔE for a typical metal for
typical currents, it would be ∼10−6 eV whereas EFO is 1–10 eV. The shift in the
distribution in Figure 4.13c is very small indeed; a′ and b′, for all practical purposes,
are at the Fermi level.)
Conduction can be explained very simply and intuitively in terms of a band
diagram as shown in Figure 4.14. Notice that the application of the electric field
bends the energy band, because the electrostatic PE of the electron is −eV(x) where
V(x) is the voltage at position x. However, V(x) changes linearly from 0 to V, by
virtue of dV∕dx = −Ex. Since E = −eV(x) adds to the energy of the electron, the
energy band must bend to account for the additional electrostatic energy. Since only
the electrons near EFO contribute to electrical conduction, we can represent this by
drifting the electrons at EFO down the potential hill. Although these electrons possess
a very high mean velocity (∼106 ms−1), as determined by the Fermi energy, they
drift very slowly (10−2−10−1 ms−1) with a velocity that is drift mobility × field.
When a metal is illuminated, provided the wavelength of the radiation is correct,
it will cause the emission of electrons from the metal as in the photoelectric effect.
Since Φ is the “minimum energy” required to excite an electron into the vacuum
level (out from the metal), the longest wavelength radiation required is hc∕λ = Φ.
The addition of heat to a metal can excite some of the electrons in the band to
higher energy levels. Thus heat can also be absorbed by the conduction electrons of
a metal. We also know that the addition of heat increases the amplitude of atomic
vibrations. We can therefore guess that the heat capacity of a metal has two terms
which are due to energy absorption by the lattice vibrations and energy absorption
by conduction electrons. It turns out that at room temperature the energy absorption
by lattice vibrations dominates the heat capacity whereas at the lowest temperatures
(typically a few Kelvins) the electronic contribution is important.

4
In some books (including the first edition of this textbook) it is stated that the electrons at EFO can gain
energy from the field and contribute to conduction but not those deep in the band (below b′). This is a simplified
statement of the fact that at a level below EFO there is one electron moving along in the +x direction and gaining
energy and another one at the same energy but moving along in the −x direction and losing energy so that an
average electron at this level does not gain energy.

METALLIC LIQUID HYDROGEN IN JUPITER AND ITS MAGNETIC FIELD The surface of
Jupiter, as visualized schematically in Figure 4.15, mainly consists of a mixture of molecular
hydrogen and He gases. Deep in the planet, however, the pressure is so tremendous that the
hydrogen molecular bond breaks, leaving a dense ocean of hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen has
only one electron in the 1s energy level. When atoms are densely packed, the 1s energy level
forms an energy band, which is then only half filled. This is just like the Li metal, which
means we can treat liquid hydrogen as a liquid metal, with electrical properties reminiscent
of liquid mercury. Liquid hydrogen can sustain electric currents, which in turn can give rise
to the magnetic fields on Jupiter. The origin of the electric currents are not known with
certainty. We do know, however, that the core of the planet is hot and emanates heat, which
causes convection currents. Temperature differences can readily give rise to electric currents,
by virtue of thermoelectric effects, as discussed in Section 4.8.2.

MODERN THEORY OF SOLIDS

The Be atom has an electronic structure of 1s22s2. Although the
Be atom has a full 2s energy level, solid Be is a metal. Why?

WHAT MAKES A METAL?
SOLUTION

We will neglect the K shell (1s state), which is full and very close to the nucleus, and consider
only the higher energy states. In the solid, the 2s energy level splits into N levels, forming a
2s band. With 2N electrons, each level is occupied by spin-paired electrons. The 2s band is
therefore full. However, the empty 2p band, from the empty 2p energy levels, overlaps the
2s band, thereby providing empty energy levels to these 2N electrons. Thus, the conduction
electrons are in an energy band that is only partially filled; they can gain energy from the
field to contribute to electrical conduction. Solid Be is therefore a metal.

EXAMPLE 4.4

FERMI SPEED OF CONDUCTION ELECTRONS IN A METAL In copper, the Fermi energy

of conduction electrons is 7.0 eV. What is the speed of the conduction electrons around this
energy?
SOLUTION

Since the conduction electrons are not bound to any one atom, their PE must be zero within
the solid (but large outside), so all their energy is kinetic. For conduction electrons around
the Fermi energy EFO with a speed vF, we have

Although the Fermi energy depends on the properties of the energy band, to a good
approximation it is only weakly temperature dependent, so vF will be relatively temperature
insensitive, as we will show later in Section 4.7.

4.3

SEMICONDUCTORS

The Si atom has 14 electrons, which distribute themselves in the various atomic
energy levels as shown in Figure 4.16. The inner shells (n = 1 and n = 2) are full
and therefore “closed.” Since these shells are near the nucleus, when Si atoms come
together to form the solid, they are not much affected and they stay around the parent Si atoms. They can therefore be excluded from further discussion. The 3s and
3p subshells are farther away from the nucleus. When two Si atoms approach, these
electrons strongly interact with each other. Therefore, in studying the formation of
bands in the Si solid, we will only consider the 3s and 3p levels.
The first task is to examine why Si actually bonds with four neighbors, since
the 3s orbital is full and there are only two electrons in the 3p orbitals. The full 3s
orbital should not overlap a neighbor and become involved in bonding. Since only
two 3p orbitals are half full, bonds should be formed with two neighboring Si atoms.

Figure 4.17 (a) Si is in Group IV in the Periodic Table. An isolated Si atom has two
electrons in the 3s and two electrons in the 3p orbitals. (b) When Si is about to bond,
the one 3s orbital and the three 3p orbitals become perturbed and mixed to form four
hybridized orbitals, ψhyb, called sp3 orbitals, which are directed toward the corners of
a tetrahedron. The ψhyb orbital has a large major lobe and a small back lobe. Each ψhyb
orbital takes one of the four valence electrons.

In reality, the 3s and 3p energy levels are quite close, and when five Si atoms approach
each other, the interaction results in the four orbitals ψ(3s), ψ(3px), ψ(3py), and ψ(3pz)
mixing together to form four new hybrid orbitals, which are directed in tetrahedral
directions; that is, each one is aimed as far away from the others as possible as
illustrated in Figure 4.17. We call this process sp3 hybridization, since one s orbital
and three p orbitals are mixed. (The superscript 3 on p has nothing to do with the
number of electrons; it refers to the number of p orbitals used in the hybridization.)
The four sp3 hybrid orbitals, ψhyb, each have one electron, so they are half occupied. This means that four Si atoms can have their orbitals ψhyb overlap to form bonds
with one Si atom, which is what actually happens; thus, one Si atom bonds with
four other Si atoms in tetrahedral directions.
In the same way, one Si atom bonds with four H atoms to form the important
gas SiH4, known as silane, which is widely used in the semiconductor technology
to fabricate Si devices. In SiH4, four hybridized orbitals of the Si atom overlap with
the 1s orbitals of four H atoms. In exactly the same way, one carbon atom bonds
with four hydrogen atoms to form methane, CH4.
There are two ways in which the hybrid orbital ψhyb can overlap with that of the
neighboring Si atom to form two molecular orbitals. They can add in phase (both
positive or both negative) or out of phase (one positive and the other negative) to
produce a bonding or an antibonding molecular orbital ψB and ψA, respectively, with
energies EB and EA as shown in Figure 4.18a to c. Each Si–Si bond thus corresponds
to two paired electrons in a bonding molecular orbital ψB. In the solid, there are
N(∼5 × 1022 cm−3) Si atoms, and there are nearly as many such ψB bonds. The interactions between the ψB orbitals (i.e., the Si–Si bonds) lead to the splitting of the EB energy
level to N levels, thereby forming an energy band labeled the valence band (VB) by

virtue of the valence electrons it contains. Since the energy level EB is full, so is the
valence band. Figure 4.18c and d illustrate the formation of the VB from EB.
In the solid, the interactions between the N number of ψA orbitals result in the
splitting of the energy level EA to N levels and the formation of an energy band
that is completely empty and separated from the full valence band by a definite
energy gap Eg. In this energy region, there are no states; therefore, the electron cannot have energy with a value within Eg. The energy band formed from NψA orbitals
is a conduction band (CB), as also indicated in Figure 4.18c and d.
The electronic states in the VB (and also in the CB) extend throughout the whole
solid, because they result from NψB orbitals interfering and overlapping each other.
As before NψB, orbitals can overlap in N different ways to produce N distinct wavefunctions ψvb that extend throughout the solid. We cannot relate a particular electron
to a particular bond or site because the wavefunctions ψvb corresponding to the VB
energies are not concentrated at a single location. The electrical properties of solids
are based on the fact that in solids, such as semiconductors and insulators, there are
certain bands of allowed energies for the electrons, and these bands are separated by
energy gaps, that is, bandgaps. The valence and conduction bands for the ideal Si
crystal shown in Figure 4.18d are separated by an energy gap, or a bandgap, Eg,
in which there are no allowed electron energy levels.

Figure 4.19 A simplified energy band
diagram of a semiconductor. CB is the
conduction band and VB is the valence
band. At 0 K, the VB is full of electrons
and the CB is empty. If a photon of energy
hf > Eg is incident on the semiconductor, it
can be absorbed by an electron in the VB,
which becomes photoexcited into the CB.
Some electrons in the VB can be
excited into the CB by thermal excitation,
that is, occasional rupturing of Si-Si bonds
by energetic lattice vibrations. Thermal
generation creates electron and hole pairs.

We can generalize the energy band diagram of a semiconductor as shown in
Figure 4.19. At absolute zero of temperature the VB will be full of electrons and
the CB will be empty. The conductivity of this ideal semiconductor would be zero
as there are no free carriers to drift. It is possible to excite an electron from the VB
to the CB if a photon of energy hf equal or greater than the bandgap is incident on
this semiconductor. The photon can be absorbed by an electron in the VB, which
becomes photoexcited into the CB5. An electron in the CB is essentially in an empty
band. We can consider this electron in the CB as a free carrier with a certain effective mass m*.
e If there is an electric field Ex along x then this photoexcited electron
will be acted on by a force, F = −eEx, and it will try to move in the −x direction.
For it to do so, there must be empty higher energy levels, so that as the electron
accelerates and gains energy, it moves up in the band. When an electron collides
with a lattice vibration, it loses the energy acquired from the field and drops down
within the CB. Again, it should be emphasized that states in an energy band are
extended; that is, the electron is not localized to any one atom.
Note also that the photogeneration of an electron from the VB to the CB leaves
behind a VB state with a missing electron. This unoccupied electron state has an
apparent positive charge, because this crystal region was neutral prior to the removal
of the electron. The VB state with the missing electron is called a hole and is denoted
h+. The hole can “move” in the direction of the field by exchanging places with a
neighboring valence electron hence it contributes to conduction, as will be discussed
in Chapter 5.
At temperatures above absolute zero, the atoms in a solid vibrate due to their
thermal energy. Some of the atoms can acquire a sufficiently high energy from
thermal fluctuations to strain and rupture their bonds. Physically, there is a possibility that the atomic vibration will impart sufficient energy to the electron for it to
surmount the bonding energy and leave the bond. The electron must then enter a
higher energy state. In the case of Si, this means entering a state in the CB, as shown
in Figure 4.19. The excitation of electrons from the VB to the CB by lattice vibrations is called thermal generation, and results in the generation of electrons in the
5

In pure intuitive terms, the incident photon has sufficient energy to be able to rupture a Si–Si bond and
release a free electron. An electron is free only in the CB, so this process implies the photoexcitation of an
electron from the VB to the CB.

EXAMPLE 4.5

ELECTRON AFFINITY AND PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES Photomultiplier tubes are used in
various high gain photodetection applications that involve detecting low light intensities. A
simplified structure of a photomultiplier tube is shown in Figure 4.20. The tube is evacuated
and has a photocathode for receiving photons as signal. An incoming photon causes photoemission of an electron from the photocathode material. The photocathode can be metal,
in which case the photoemission will be as in Figure 4.12. Usually, the photocathode is a
semiconductor, or a metal that has its surface coated with a semiconductor. The photoemission
in this case is shown in Figure 4.21a. The vacuum level is at an energy χ above the conduction band edge Ec. The energy χ needed to remove an electron from Ec to the vacuum is
called the electron affinity of the semiconductor. Thus, only those photons with an energy
hf > Eg + χ can cause photoemission, because the electron has to be excited from the valence
band (VB) to energies in the CB that are above χ as shown in Figure 4.21a. The photoemitted
electron is then accelerated by a positive voltage applied to an electrode called a dynode as
in Figure 4.20. When the accelerated projectile electron strikes the dynode material, it causes
the emission of electrons from the dynode surface. Electron bombardment induced electron
emission from a material is called secondary electron emission. When the accelerated electron strikes the dynode D1 it can release several electrons. All these electrons, the original
and the secondary electrons, are then accelerated by the more positive voltage applied to the
dynode D2. On impact with D2, further electrons are released by secondary emission. The
secondary emission process continues at each dynode stage until the final electrode, called
the anode, is reached whereupon all the electrons are collected which results in a signal.
Typical applications for photomultiplier tubes are in X-ray and nuclear medical instruments
(X-ray CT scanner, positron CT scanner, gamma camera, etc.), radiation measuring instruments (e.g., radon counter), X-ray diffractometers and radiation measurement in high energy
physics research.

Figure 4.21 (a) Photoemission process in a semiconductor is different than in a metal and excites an electron
from the VB to the CB. If this electron has a kinetic energy greater than the electron affinity and if it can reach
the surface before being scattered, it can be emitted. (b) A primary projectile electron with sufficient energy
knocks out an electron from the VB into the CB. The electron in the CB is a secondary electron that can
escape the semiconductor if it can reach the surface. There may be several secondary electrons generated.
Further, the primary electron can also be emitted back to vacuum.

When a sufficiently energetic electron impinges on a dynode material it knocks out an
electron from the dynode. Usually, the dynode is a semiconducting material so that the
incident energetic primary electron enters the CB and interacts with the valence electrons.
This interaction results in an electron that is knocked out from the VB into the high energy
levels in the CB, above Ec + χ; and if it is close to the surface, it can escape as shown in
Figure 4.21b. Notice that the primary electron generates an electron and hole pair (EHP) as
the electron is excited from the VB to the CB. A sufficiently energetic primary electron can
release several secondary electrons, and it may itself escape the semiconductor, for example,
if it is scattered towards the surface. The secondary electron yield δ is defined as
δ=

Number of secondary electrons emitted
Number of incident primary electrons

electron yield

Given that the electron multiplication at each dynode is δ, the overall gain after N dynodes
is δN. The dynode material in modern photomultipliers have δ values around 5 – 10; and with
several dynodes, the electron multiplication can easily reach ∼106. Typical dynode materials
are compounds such as BeO, GaP, MgO, Cs3Sb.

CUTOFF WAVELENGTH OF A Si PHOTODETECTOR What wavelengths of light can be
absorbed by a Si photodetector given Eg = 1.1 eV? Can such a photodetector be used in
fiber-optic communications at light wavelengths of 1.31 μm and 1.55 μm?

EXAMPLE 4.6

334

CHAPTER 4

∙

MODERN THEORY OF SOLIDS

SOLUTION

The energy bandgap Eg of Si is 1.1 eV. A photon must have at least this much energy to
excite an electron from the VB to the CB, where the electron can drift. Excitation corresponds
to the breaking of a Si–Si bond. A photon of less energy does not get absorbed, because its
energy will put the electron in the bandgap where there are no states. Thus, hc∕λ > Eg gives
λ <

=

(1.1 eV) (1.6 × 10−19 J/eV)

or

1.1 μm

Since optical communications networks use wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm, these light waves
will not be absorbed by Si and thus cannot be detected by a Si photodetector.

4.4

ELECTRON EFFECTIVE MASS

When an electric field Ex is applied to a metal, an electron near the Fermi level can
gain energy from the field and move to higher energy levels, as shown in Figure 4.13.
The external force Fext = eEx is in the x direction, and it drives the electron along
x. The acceleration of the electron is still given by a = Fext∕me, where me is the mass
of the electron in vacuum.
The law Fext = mea cannot strictly be valid for the electron inside a solid, because
the electron interacts with the host ions and experiences internal forces Fint as it
moves around, as depicted in Figure 4.22. The electron therefore has a PE that varies with distance. Recall that we interpret mass as inertial resistance against acceleration per unit applied force. When an external force Fext is applied to an electron
in the vacuum level, as in Figure 4.22a, the electron will accelerate by an amount
avac =

4.4

ELECTRON EFFECTIVE MASS

When the same force Fext is applied to the electron inside a crystal, the acceleration of the electron will be different, because it will also experience internal
forces, as shown in Figure 4.22b. Its acceleration in the crystal will be
acryst =

Fext + Fint
me

[4.5]

where Fint is the sum of all the internal forces acting on the electron, which is quite
different than Equation 4.4. To the outside agent applying the force Fext, the electron
will appear to be exhibiting a different inertial mass, since its acceleration will be
different. It would be most useful for the external agent if the effect of the internal
forces in Fint could be accounted for in a simple way, and if the acceleration could
be calculated from the external force Fext alone, through something like Equation 4.4.
This is indeed possible.
In a crystalline solid, the atoms are arranged periodically, and the variation
of Fint, and hence the PE, or V(x), of the electron with distance along x, is also
periodic. In principle, then, the effect on the electron motion can be predicted
and accounted for. When we solve the Schrödinger equation with the periodic PE,
or V(x), we essentially obtain the effect of these internal forces on the electron
motion. It has been found that when the electron is in a band that is not full, we
can still use Equation 4.4, but instead of the mass in vacuum me, we must use
the effective mass m*e of the electron in that particular crystal. The effective mass
is a quantum mechanical quantity that behaves in the same way as the inertial
mass in classical mechanics. The acceleration of the electron in the crystal is
then simply
acryst =

Fext
m*e

[4.6]

The effects of all internal forces are incorporated into m*e. It should be
emphasized that m*e is obtained theoretically from the solution of the Schrödinger
equation for the electron in a particular crystal, a task that is by no means
trivial. However, the effective mass can be readily measured. For some of the
familiar metals, m*e is very close to me. For example, in silver, m*e = me for all
practical purposes, whereas in lithium m*e = 2.2me, as shown in Table 4.2. On
the other hand, m*e for many metals and semiconductors is appreciably different
than the electron mass in vacuum and can even be negative. (m*e depends on the
properties of the band that contains the electron as discussed in Section 5.13.)

MODERN THEORY OF SOLIDS

DENSITY OF STATES IN AN ENERGY BAND

Although we know there are many energy levels (perhaps ∼1023) in a given band,
we have not yet considered how many states (or electron wavefunctions) there are
per unit energy per unit volume in that band. Consider the following intuitive argument. The crystal will have N atoms and there will be N electron wavefunctions ψ1,
ψ2, . . . , ψN that represent the electron within the whole crystal. These wavefunctions
are constructed from N different combinations of atomic wavefunctions, ψA, ψB,
ψC, . . . as schematically illustrated in Figure 4.23a,6 starting with
ψ1 = ψA + ψB + ψC + ψD + · · ·

all the way to alternating signs
ψN = ψA − ψB + ψC − ψD + · · ·

and there are N(∼10 ) combinations. The lowest-energy wavefunction will be ψ1
constructed by adding all atomic wavefunctions (all in phase), and the highest-energy
wavefunction will be ψN from alternating the signs of the atomic wavefunctions,
which will have the highest number of nodes. Between these two extremes, especially
around N∕2, there will be many combinations that will have comparable energies
and fall near the middle of the band. (By analogy, if we arrange N = 10 coins by
heads and tails, there will be many combinations of coins in which there are 5 heads
and 5 tails, and only one combination in which there are 10 heads or 10 tails.) We
therefore expect the number of energy levels, each corresponding to an electron
wavefunction in the crystal, in the central regions of the band to be very large as
depicted in Figure 4.23b and c.
Figure 4.23c illustrates schematically how the energy and volume density of
electronic states change across an energy band. We define the density of states g(E)
such that g(E) dE is the number of states (i.e., wavefunctions) in the energy interval
E to (E + dE) per unit volume of the sample. Thus, the number of states per unit
volume up to some energy E′ is
23

E′

Sv (E′) =

∫ g(E) dE

[4.7]

0

which is called the total number of states per unit volume with energies less than
E′. This is denoted Sv(E′).
To determine the density of states function g(E), we must first determine the
number of states with energies less than E′ in a given band. This is tantamount to
calculating Sv(E′) in Equation 4.7. Instead, we will improvise and use the energy
levels for an electron in a 3D potential well. Recall that the energy of an electron in
a cubic PE well of size L is given by
E=

This intuitive argument, as schematically depicted in Figure 4.23a, is obviously highly simplified because the
solid is three-dimensional (3D) and we should combine the atomic wavefunctions not on a linear chain but on a
3D lattice. In the 3D case there are large numbers of wavefunctions with energies that fall in the central regions
of the band.

Figure 4.23 (a) In the solid there are N atoms and N extended electron wavefunctions from ψ1
all the way to ψN. There are many wavefunctions, states, that have energies that fall in the central

sequential atoms among N atoms, and N is very large. Overall, the wavefunctions for N atoms

where n1, n2, and n3 are integers 1, 2, 3, . . . . The spatial dimension L of the well
now refers to the size of the entire solid, as the electron is confined to be somewhere inside that solid. Thus, L is very large compared to atomic dimensions,
which means that the separation between the energy levels is very small. We will
use Equation 4.8 to describe the energies of free electrons inside the solid (as in
a metal).
Each combination of n1, n2, and n3 is one electron orbital state. For example,
ψn1,n2,n3 = ψ1,1,2 is one possible orbital state. Suppose that in Equation 4.8 E is given
as E′. We need to determine how many combinations of n1, n2, n3 (i.e., how many ψ)
have energies less than E′, as given by Equation 4.8. Assume that (n12 + n22 + n32) = n′2.
The object is to enumerate all possible choices of integers for n1, n2, and n3 that
satisfy n21 + n22 + n23 ≤ n′2.
The two-dimensional 2D case is easy to solve. Consider n21 + n22 ≤ n′2 and the
2D n-space where the axes are n1 and n2, as shown in Figure 4.24. The 2D space
is divided by lines drawn at n1 = 1, 2, 3, . . . and n2 = 1, 2, 3, . . . into infinitely
many boxes (squares), each of which has a unit area and represents a possible state
ψn1,n2 . For example, the state n1 = 1, n2 = 3 is shaded, as is that for n1 = 2, n2 = 2.
Clearly, the area contained by n1, n2 and the circle defined by n′2 = n21 + n22
( just like r2 = x2 + y2) is the number of states that satisfy n21 + n22 ≤ n′2. This area
is 14 (πn′ 2 ) .

defined by a sphere of radius n′ and the positive
axes n1, n2, and n3, contains all the possible
combinations of positive n1, n2, and n3 values that

In the 3D case, n12 + n22 + n32 ≤ n′2 is required, as indicated in Figure 4.25. This is
the volume contained by the positive n1, n2, and n3 axes and the surface of a sphere of
radius n′. Each state has a unit volume, and within the sphere, n12 + n22 + n32 ≤ n′2 is
satisfied. Therefore, the number of orbital states Sorb(n′) within this volume is given by

Equation 4.10 shows that the density of states g(E) increases with energy as E1∕2
from the bottom of the band. As we approach the top of the band, according to our
understanding in Figure 4.23c, g(E) should decrease with energy as (Etop − E)1∕2,
where Etop is the top of the band, so that as E → Etop, g(E) → 0. The electron mass
me in Equation 4.10 should be the effective mass m*e as in Equation 4.6. Further,
Equation 4.10 strictly applies only to free electrons in a crystal. However, we will
frequently use it to approximate the true g(E) versus E behavior near the band edges
for both metals and semiconductors.
Having found the distribution of the electron energy states, Equation 4.10, we
now wish to determine the number of states that actually contain electrons; that is,
the probability of finding an electron at an energy level E. This is given by the
Fermi–Dirac statistics.
As an example, one convenient way of calculating the population of a city is to
find the density of houses in that city (i.e., the number of houses per unit area),
multiply that by the probability of finding a human in a house, and finally, integrate
the result over the area of the city. The problem is working out the chances of actually finding someone at home, using a mathematical formula. For those who like
analogies, if g(A) is the density of houses and f (A) is the probability that a house is
occupied, then the population of the city is
n=

∫ f (A)g(A) dA
City

where the integration is done over the entire area of the city. This equation can be
used to find the number of electrons per unit volume within a band. If E is the
electron energy and f (E) is the probability that a state with energy E is occupied,
then

where the integration is done over all the energies of the band.

X-RAY EMISSION AND THE DENSITY OF STATES IN A METAL Consider what happens
when a metal such as Al is bombarded with high-energy electrons. The inner atomic energy
levels are not disturbed in the solid, so these inner levels remain as distinct single levels, each
one localized to the parent atom. When an energetic electron hits an electron in one of the
inner atomic energy levels, it knocks out this electron from the metal leaving behind a vacancy
in the inner core as depicted in Figure 4.26a. An electron in the energy band of the solid can
then fall down to occupy this empty state and emit a photon in the process. The energy difference between the energies in the band and the inner atomic level is in the X-ray range, so
the emitted photon is an X-ray photon. Since electrons occupy the band from the bottom EB
to the Fermi level EF, the emitted X-ray photons have a range of energies corresponding to
transitions from EB and EF to the inner atomic level as shown in Figure 4.26b. These energies
are in the soft X-ray spectrum. We assumed that the levels above EF are almost empty, though,
undoubtedly, there is no sharp transition from full to empty levels at EF. Further, since the

Figure 4.26 (a) High-energy electron bombardment knocks out an electron from the closed

the L shell to fill the vacancy and emits a soft X-ray photon in the process. (b) The spectrum

energies corresponding to transitions from the bottom of the band and from the Fermi level

density of states increases from EB toward EF, there are more and more electrons that can
fall down to the inner atomic level as we move from EB toward EF. Therefore, the intensity
of the emitted X-ray radiation increases with photon energy until the energy reaches the Fermi
level beyond which there are only a small number of electrons available for the transit.
Figure 4.26c and d contrasts the emission spectra from an aluminum crystal (solid) and its
vapor. The line spectra from a vapor become an emission band in the spectrum of the solid.
The emitted radiation from the solid that involves the transitions of the conduction band
electrons to core levels is called soft X-ray emission spectrum.
The X-ray intensity emitted from Al in Figure 4.26b starts to rise at around 61 eV and
then sharply falls around 73 eV. Thus the energy range is 12 eV, which represents approximately
the Fermi energy with respect to the bottom of the band, that is, EF ≈ 73 − 61 = 12 eV with
respect to EB.

(5 × 1.6 × 10−19 ) 1∕2 = 9.50 × 1046 m−3 J−1

Converting to cm−3 and eV−1, we get
gcenter = (9.50 × 1046 m−3 J−1)(10−6 m3 cm−3)(1.6 × 10−19 J eV−1)
= 1.52 × 1022 cm−3 eV−1

If δE is a small energy range (such as kT), then, by definition, g(E) δE is the number
of states per unit volume in δE. To find the number of states per unit volume within kT at
the center of the band, we multiply gcenter by kT or (1.52 × 1022 cm−3 eV−1)(0.026 eV) to get
3.9 × 1020 cm−3. This is not a small number!
At kT above the bottom of the band, at 300 K (kT = 0.026 eV), we have
g0.026 = (8π21∕2 ) [

= 1.10 × 1021 cm−3 eV−1

Within kT, the volume density of states is
(1.10 × 1021 cm−3 eV−1)(0.026 eV) = 2.8 × 1019 cm−3

This is very close to the bottom of the band and is still very large.

By integrating g(E), estimate the total number of states in the 3s-band of Na and

Na given in Table 4.2.
SOLUTION

a.

b.

We know that when N atoms come together to form a solid, N atomic orbitals can overlap N different ways to produce N orbitals or 2N states in the crystal, since each orbital
has two states, spin up and spin down. These states form the band.
To estimate the total volume density of states, we assume that the density of states g(E)
reaches its maximum at the center of the band E = Ecenter = 3 eV. Integrating g(E) from
the bottom of the band, E = 0, to the center, E = Ecenter, yields the number of states per
unit volume up to the center of the band. This is roughly half the total number of states
in the whole band, (see Figure 4.23c), that is, 12 Sband , where Sband is the number of states
per unit volume in the band and is determined by

We must now calculate the number of atoms per unit volume in sodium. Given the
density d = 0.968 g cm−3 and the atomic mass Mat = 22.99 g mol−1 of sodium, the atomic
concentration is
nAg =

The density of states in the 3s band is about about 2.4 times the atomic concentration.
Given the crude approximations we have used, the estimate can be considered to be reasonably close to the expected value of twice the atomic concentration for the 3s-band.

4.6.1 BOLTZMANN CLASSICAL STATISTICS
Given a collection of particles in random motion and colliding with each other,7 we
need to determine the concentration of particles in the energy range E to (E + dE).
Consider the process shown in Figure 4.27, in which two electrons with energies E1
and E2 interact and then move off in different directions, with energies E3 and E4.
Let the probability of an electron having an energy E be P(E), where P(E) is the
fraction of electrons with an energy E. Assume there are no restrictions to the electron energies, that is, we can ignore the Pauli exclusion principle. The probability
of this event is then P(E1)P(E2). The probability of the reverse process, in which
electrons with energies E3 and E4 interact, is P(E3)P(E4). Since we have thermal
equilibrium, that is, the system is in equilibrium, the forward process must be just
as likely as the reverse process, so
P(E1)P(E2) = P(E3)P(E4)

[4.11]

Furthermore, the energy in this collision must be conserved, so we also need
E1 + E2 = E3 + E4

[4.12]

We can show that P(E) = A exp(−βE), where A and β are constants, is a solution
by simply substituting this expression into Equations 4.11 and 4.12. Further, we can
also show that β must be 1∕kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the
temperature, by comparing the average energy calculated from using P(E) with that
observed in experiments.8
P(E) = A exp(−

E

[4.13]

Boltzmann
probability
function

Equation 4.13 is the Boltzmann probability function and is shown in Figure 4.28.
The probability of finding a particle at an energy E therefore decreases exponentially
with energy. We assume, of course, that any number of particles may have a given
energy E. In other words, there is no restriction such as permitting only one particle
per state at an energy E, as in the Pauli exclusion principle.
Suppose that we have N1 particles at energy level E1 and N2 particles at a higher
energy E2. Then, by Equation 4.13, we have

[4.14]

If E2 − E1 ≫ kT, then N2 can be orders of magnitude smaller than N1. As the
temperature increases, N2∕Nl also increases. Therefore, increasing the temperature
populates the higher energy levels.
Classical particles obey the Boltzmann statistics. Whenever there are many more
states (by orders of magnitude) than the number of particles, the likelihood of

two particles having the same set of quantum numbers is negligible and we do not have
to worry about the Pauli exclusion principle. In these cases, we can use the Boltzmann
statistics. An important example is the statistics of electrons in the conduction band
of a semiconductor where, in general, there are many more states than electrons.

4.6.2 FERMI–DIRAC STATISTICS
Now consider the interaction for which no two electrons can be in the same quantum
state, which is essentially obedience to the Pauli exclusion principle, as shown in
Figure 4.27. We assume that we can have only one electron in a particular quantum
state ψ (including spin) associated with the energy value E. We therefore need those
states that have energies E3 and E4 to be not occupied. Let f(E) be the probability
that an electron is in such a state, with energy E in this new interaction environment.
The forward event in Figure 4.27 requires that we have an electrons at E1 and E2 and,
at the same time, E3 and E4 must be unoccupied (empty). Thus, the probability of
the forward event is given by.
f (E1) f (E2)[1 − f (E3)][1 − f (E4)]

The square brackets represent the probability that the states with energies E3 and E4
are empty. In thermal equilibrium, the reverse process, the electrons with E3 and E4
interacting to transfer to E1 and E2, has just as equal a likelihood as the forward
process. Thus, f (E) must satisfy the equation
f(E1) f(E2)[1 − f (E3)][1 − f (E4)] = f(E3) f (E4)[1 − f (E1)][1 − f (E2)]

[4.15]

In addition, for energy conservation, we must have
E1 + E2 = E3 + E4

By an “intelligent guess,” the solution to Equations 4.15 and 4.16 is
f (E) =

1

1 + A exp(

E
kT )

[4.17]

where A is a constant. You can check that this is a solution by substituting Equation
4.17 into 4.15 and using Equation 4.16. The reason for the term kT in Equation 4.17
is not obvious from Equations 4.15 and 4.16. It appears in Equation 4.17 so that at
sufficiently high energies Equation 4.17 becomes the same as the Boltzmann distribution in Equation 4.13 in agreement with experiments.9 In a more rigorous approach
we would use a constant 1∕β instead of kT in Equation 4.17, and then show that β
must be 1∕kT by comparing the predictions based on Equation 4.17 with experiments.
Letting A = exp(−EF∕kT), we can write Equation 4.17 as
f (E) =

1
E − EF
1 + exp(
kT )

[4.18]

where EF is a constant called the Fermi energy. The probability of finding an
electron in a state with energy E is given by Equation 4.18, which is called the
Fermi–Dirac function.
The behavior of the Fermi–Dirac function is shown in Figure 4.29. Note
the effect of temperature. As T increases, f (E) extends to higher energies. At

If N1 and N2 are the number of electrons at energies E1 and E2, then the Boltzman distribution predicts
Equation (4.14) for N1∕N2. At sufficiently high energies Equation 4.17 gives the same prediction for N1∕N2. The
reason is that at very high energies there are very few electrons compared with the available number of states
at these energies so that it very unlikely that two electrons will try to occupy the same state; that is the Pauli
exclusion principle is not needed and the electron statistics is simply the Boltzmann distribution.

f (E) in Equation 4.19 at high energies is often referred to as the Boltzmann tail to
the Fermi–Dirac function. Notice that the spread of f (E) around EF increases with
temperature. This spread around EF is typically several kTs.

QUANTUM THEORY OF METALS

4.7.1 FREE ELECTRON MODEL10
We know that the number of states g(E) for an electron, per unit energy per unit
volume, increases with energy as g(E) ∝ E1∕2. We have also calculated that the probability of an electron being in a state with an energy E is the Fermi–Dirac function
f(E). Consider the energy band diagram for a metal and the density of states g(E)
for that band, as shown in Figure 4.30a and b, respectively.
At absolute zero, all the energy levels up to EF are full. At 0 K, f (E) has the
step form at EF (Figure 4.29). This clarifies why EF in f (E) is termed the Fermi
energy. At 0 K, f (E) = 1 for E < EF, and f (E) = 0 for E > EF, so at 0 K, EF separates the empty and full energy levels. This explains why we restricted ourselves to
0 K or thereabouts when we introduced EF in the band theory of metals.
At some finite temperature, f (E) is not zero beyond EF, as indicated in Figure
4.30c. This means that some of the electrons are excited to, and thereby occupy,

the energy levels is described by nE = g(E) f(E).
Since f(E) = 1 for E ≪ EF, the states near the bottom of the band are all occupied;
thus, nE ∝ E1∕2 initially. As E passes through EF, f(E) starts decreasing sharply. As
a result, nE takes a turn and begins to decrease sharply as well, as depicted in Figure

Since f(E) falls very sharply when E > EF, we can carry the integration to E = ∞,
rather than to (EF + Φ), because f → 0 when E ≫ EF. Putting in the functional

As an example, consider aluminum, and assume that each Al atom donates 3
electrons to the sea of conduction electrons. We can take the electron concentration
n = 3 × (Concentration of Al atoms), or 6.022 × 1028 m−3, and substitute this n into
Equation 4.22 to find EFO = 11.7 eV. In Example 4.7, from the soft X-ray emission
spectrum in Figure 4.26, we found that the Fermi energy was approximately 12 eV.
Further, we can also evaluate the speed vF of the electrons at the Fermi level by
writing 12mev 2F = EFO , which leads to vF = 2.0 × 106 m s−1.
It may be thought that EF is temperature independent, since it was sketched that
way in Figure 4.29. However, in our derivation of the Fermi–Dirac statistics, there
was no restriction that demanded this. Indeed, since the number of electrons in a
band is fixed, EF at a temperature T is implicitly determined by Equation 4.21, which
can be solved to express EF in terms of n and T. It turns out that at 0 K, EF is given
by Equation 4.22, and it changes very little with temperature. In fact, by utilizing
various mathematical approximations, it is not too difficult to integrate Equation 4.21
to obtain the Fermi energy at a temperature T, as follows:

at T(K)

EF (T) = EFO[ 1 −

[4.23]

which shows that EF(T) is only “slightly” temperature dependent, since EFO ≫ kT.
The Fermi energy has an important significance in terms of the average energy
Eav of the conduction electrons in a metal. In the energy range E to (E + dE),
there are nE dE electrons with energy E. The average energy of an electron will
therefore be
Eav =

Since EFO ≫ kT, the second term in the square brackets is much smaller than
unity, and Eav(T) shows only a very weak temperature dependence. Furthermore, in
our model of the metal, the electrons are free to move around within the metal, where
their potential energy PE is zero, whereas outside the metal, it is EF + Φ (Figure 4.11).
Therefore, their energy is purely kinetic. Thus, Equation 4.26 gives the average KE

where ve is the root mean square (rms) speed of the electrons, which is simply called
the effective speed. The effective speed ve depends on the Fermi energy EFO and is
relatively insensitive to temperature. Compare this with the behavior of molecules
in an ideal gas. In that case, the average KE = 23 kT , so 12mv2 = 32 kT. Clearly, the
average speed of molecules in a gas increases with temperature.
The relationship 12 mv2e ≈ 53 EFO is an important conclusion that comes from the
application of quantum mechanical concepts, ideas that lead to g(E) and f (E) and so
on. It cannot be proved without invoking quantum mechanics. The fact that the average electronic speed is nearly constant is the only way to explain the observation that
the resistivity of a metal is proportional to T (and not T 3∕2), as we saw in Chapter 2.

4.7.2 CONDUCTION IN METALS
We know from our energy band discussions that in metals only those electrons in a
small range ΔE around the Fermi energy EF contribute to electrical conduction as
shown in Figure 4.13c. The concentration nF of these electrons is approximately
g(EF) ΔE inasmuch as ΔE is very small. All these electrons within ΔE around EF
move approximately with the Fermi speed vF. The electron a moves to a′, as shown
in Figure 4.13b and c, and then it is scattered to an empty state above b′. In steady
conduction, all the electrons in the energy range ΔE that are moving to the right are
not canceled by any moving to the left and hence contribute to the current. An
electron at the bottom of the ΔE range gains energy ΔE to move a′ in a time interval Δt that corresponds to the scattering time τ. It gains a momentum Δpx. Since
Δpx∕Δt = external force = eEx, we have Δpx = τeEx. The electron a has an energy
E = p2x∕(2m*e ) which we can differentiate to obtain ΔE when the momentum changes
by Δpx,
ΔE =

The current Jx is due to all the electrons in the range ΔE which are moving
toward the right in Figure 4.13c,
Jx = enFvF = e[g(EF)ΔE]vF = e[g(EF)evFτEx]vF = e2v F2 τg(EF)Ex

The conductivity is therefore
σ = e2v F2 τg(EF)

However, the numerical factor is wrong because Figure 4.13c considers only a
hypothetical 1D crystal. In a 3D crystal, the conductivity is one-third of the conductivity value just determined:

[4.27]

This conductivity expression is in sharp contrast with the classical expression in
which all the electrons contribute to conduction. According to Equation 4.27, what
is important is the density of states at the Fermi energy g(EF). For example, Cu and
Mg are metals with valencies I and II. Classically, Cu and Mg atoms each contribute
one and two conduction electrons, respectively, into the crystal. Thus, we would
expect Mg to have higher conductivity. However, the Fermi level in Mg is where the
top tail of the 3s band overlaps the bottom tail of the 3p band where the density of
states is small. In Cu, on the other hand, EF is nearly in the middle of the 4s band
where the density of states is high. Thus, Mg has a lower conductivity than Cu.
The scattering time τ in Equation 4.27 assumes that the scattered electrons at
EF remain in the same energy band. In certain metals, there are two different energy
bands that overlap at EF. For example, in Ni (see Figure 4.68), 3d and 4s bands
overlap at EF. An electron can be scattered from the 4s to the 3d band, and vice
versa. Electrons in the 3d band have very low drift mobilities and effectively do not
contribute to conduction, so only g(EF) of the 4s band operates in Equation 4.27.
Since 4s to 3d band scattering is an additional scattering mechanism, by virtue of
Matthiessen’s rule, the scattering time τ for the 4s band electrons is shortened. Thus,
Ni has poorer conductivity than Cu.
In deriving Equation 4.27 we did not assume a particular density of states model.
If we now apply the free electron model for g(EF) as in Equation 4.10, and also relate
EF to the total number of conduction electrons per unit volume n as in Equation 4.22,
we would find that the conductivity is the same as the Drude model, that is,

An impinging electron knocks out an electron from an inner core shell (L-level). A conduction electron falls down and
fills this space and emits an X-ray photon. The X-ray emission intensity is proportional to the number of conduction
electrons available, f (E)g(E), and to hf 3, a quantum mechanical transition probability. The vertical axis has been scaled
to make the peak 100 percent.
Data extracted from Cady, W.M. and Tomboulian D.H., Physical Review 59, 381, 1941, Table 1.

The transition probability is proportional to two factors: (a) how conduction many electrons
are available at E to make the transition, that is nE or f (E)g(E), and (b) the quantum mechanical transition probability, which is proportional to (hf )3. It is therefore customary to plot the
measured X-ray emission intensity I divided by f 3 to indicate f(E)g(E) as shown in Figure 4.31.

If we were to repeat the calculation to find EF at 300 K, we would find that the change
is in the fourth decimal place. The term (π2∕12)(kT∕EFO)2 in Equation 4.23 is 5.2 × 10−5, or
a decrease of 0.005 percent. In many applications, we can neglect this small change.
The examination of Figure 4.31 shows that the emitted X-ray photons have energies
approximately in the range 27.0 eV to 30.3 eV. The transitions of conduction electrons from
around EF down to the L-level correspond to the maximum photon energy, which is 30.3 eV.
The smallest emitted photon energy corresponds to a conduction electron falling from the
bottom of the band to the L-level, which is 27.0 eV. Thus EF = 30.3 − 27.0 = 3.3 eV, very
close to the calculated value. (The spread of nE around EF is about ∼4kT, that is 0.1 eV.)
We can calculate the speed of electrons at EF from 12 mevF2 = EFO so that vF = 1.05 ×

Silver has a valency of I, which means that the concentration of conduction electrons

Suppose that two metals, platinum (Pt) with a work function 5.36 eV and molybdenum
(Mo) with a work function 4.20 eV, are brought together, as shown in Figure 4.32a.
We know that in metals, all the energy levels up to the Fermi level are full. Since

The contact potentials oppose each other.

the Fermi level is higher in Mo (due to a smaller Φ), the electrons in Mo are more
energetic. They therefore immediately go over to the Pt surface (by tunneling), where
there are empty states at lower energies, which they can occupy. This electron transfer
from Mo to the Pt surface reduces the total energy of the electrons in the Pt–Mo
system, but at the same time, the Pt surface becomes negatively charged with respect
to the Mo surface. Consequently, a contact voltage (or a potential difference) develops at the junction between Pt and Mo, with the Mo side being positive.
The electron transfer from Mo to Pt continues until the contact potential is large
enough to prevent further electron transfer: the system reaches equilibrium. It should
be apparent that the transfer of energetic electrons from Mo to Pt continues until the
two Fermi levels are lined up, that is, until the Fermi level is uniform and the same
in both metals, so that no part of the system has more (or less) energetic electrons,
as illustrated in Figure 4.32b. Otherwise, the energetic electrons in one part of the
system will flow toward a region with lower energy states. Under these conditions,
the Pt–Mo system is in equilibrium. The contact voltage ΔV is determined by the
difference in the work functions, that is,
e ΔV = Φ(Pt) − Φ(Mo) = 5.36 eV − 4.20 eV = 1.16 eV

We should note that away from the junction on the Mo side, we must still provide an energy of Φ = 4.20 eV to free an electron, whereas away from the junction
on the Pt side, we must provide Φ = 5.36 eV to free an electron. This means that
the vacuum energy level going from Mo to Pt has a step ΔΦ at the junction. Since
we must do work equivalent to ΔΦ to get a free electron (e.g., on the metal surface)
from the Mo surface to the Pt surface, this represents a voltage of ΔΦ∕e or 1.16 V.
From the second law of thermodynamics,11 this contact voltage cannot do work;
that is, it cannot drive current in an external circuit. To see this, we can close the
Pt metal–Mo metal circuit to form a ring, as depicted in Figure 4.33. As soon as we
close the circuit, we create another junction with a contact voltage that is equal and
opposite to that of the first junction. Consequently, going around the circuit, the net
voltage is zero and the current is therefore zero.
There is a deep significance to the Fermi energy EF, which should at least be
mentioned. For a given metal the Fermi energy represents the free energy per electron
11

By the way, the second law of thermodynamics simply says that you cannot extract heat from a system in
thermal equilibrium and do work (i.e., charge × voltage).

called the electrochemical potential μ. In other words, the Fermi energy is a measure
of the potential of an electron to do electrical work (e × V) or nonmechanical work,
through chemical or physical processes.12 In general, when two metals are brought into
contact, the Fermi level (with respect to a vacuum) in each will be different. This difference means a difference in the chemical potential Δμ, which in turn means that the
system will do external work, which is obviously not possible. Instead, electrons are
immediately transferred from one metal to the other, until the free energy per electron
μ for the whole system is minimized and is uniform across the two metals, so that
Δμ = 0 or ΔEF = 0. We can guess that if the Fermi level in one metal could be
maintained at a higher level than the other, by using an external energy source (e.g.,
light or heat), for example, then the difference could be used to do electrical work.
Whenever two metals are brought together, as shown in Figure 4.32, the Fermi
level EF in the combined system is the same throughout the combined material system.
We can understand the Fermi level alignment through a well-known analogy.13 Consider two different beakers A and B, filled with water up to different levels EFA and
EFB from the bottom of each beaker, and placed on different tables as shown in Figure 4.34a. The two beakers are two independent systems, each with a certain level of
water EFA and EFB. Once the two systems are joined together through a pipe, as in
Figure 4.34b, we have one new combined system. Water flows from B to A until
equilibrium is reached when the water level in both A and B is the same at a height
EF. We would need external work to separate the Fermi level in the two beakers and
12
A change in any type of PE can, in principle, be used to do work, that is, Δ(PE) = work done. Chemical PE
is the potential to do nonmechanical work (e.g., electrical work) by virtue of physical or chemical processes.
The chemical PE per electron is EF and ΔEF = electrical work per electron.
13
Remember that this is only an analogy, and like all analogies, you cannot push it too far. The water case
relies on gravitational potential energy. Had the water levels not aligned in equilibrium, the difference in
the heights would mean a pressure difference (or potential energy difference) and external work could be
generated. Likewise, we would need to do work on the combined system to separate the water levels and
upset the equilibrium.

upset the equilibrium. Had the two Fermi levels not aligned in equilibrium, the difference could have been used to do external work. What is important is that, in equilibrium, the Fermi level is uniform throughout the combined system as in Figure 4.34b.

4.8.2 THE SEEBECK EFFECT AND THE THERMOCOUPLE
Consider a conductor such as an aluminum rod that is heated at one end and cooled
at the other end as depicted in Figure 4.35. The electrons in the hot region are more
energetic and therefore have greater velocities than those in the cold region.14
Consequently there is a net diffusion of electrons from the hot end toward the
cold end which leaves behind exposed positive metal ions in the hot region and
accumulates electrons in the cold region. This situation prevails until the electric
field developed between the positive ions in the hot region and the excess electrons
in the cold region prevents further electron motion from the hot to the cold end. A
voltage therefore develops between the hot and cold ends, with the hot end at positive potential. The potential difference ΔV across a piece of metal due to a temperature difference ΔT is called the Seebeck effect.15 To gauge the magnitude of
this effect we introduce a special coefficient which is defined as the potential difference developed per unit temperature difference, or
S=
14

dV
dT

[4.29]

The conduction electrons around the Fermi energy have a mean speed that has only a small temperature
dependence. This small change in the mean speed with temperature is, nonetheless, significant in intuitively
appreciating the thermoelectric effect. The actual effect, however, depends on the mean free path as discussed later.
15
Thomas Seebeck observed the thermoelectric effect in 1821 using two different metals as in the thermocouple,
which is the only way to observe the phenomenon. It was William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who explained the
observed effect.

By convention, the sign of S represents the potential of the cold side with respect
to the hot side. If electrons diffuse from the hot end to the cold end as in Figure 4.35,
then the cold side is negative with respect to the hot side and the Seebeck coefficient
is negative (as for aluminum).
In some metals, such as copper, this intuitive explanation fails to explain why
electrons actually diffuse from the cold to the hot region, giving rise to positive
Seebeck coefficients; the polarity of the voltage in Figure 4.35 is actually reversed
for copper. The reason is that the net diffusion process depends on how the mean
free path ℓ and the mean free time (due to scattering from lattice vibrations) change
with the electron energy, which can be quite complicated. Typical Seebeck coefficients for various selected metals are listed in Table 4.3.
Consider two neighboring regions H (hot) and C (cold) with widths corresponding to the mean free paths ℓ and ℓ′ in H and C as depicted in Figure 4.36a. Half the
electrons in H would be moving in the +x direction and the other half in the −x
direction. Half of the electrons in H therefore cross into C, and half in C cross into
H. Suppose that, very roughly, the electron concentration n in H and C is about the
same. The number of electrons crossing from H to C is 12 nℓ, and the number crossing from C to H is 12 nℓ′. Then,
Net diffusion from H to C ∝

[4.30]

Suppose that the scattering of electrons is such that ℓ increases strongly with
the electron energy. Then electrons in H, which are more energetic, have a longer
mean free path, that is, ℓ > ℓ′ as shown in Figure 4.36a. This means that the net

migration is from H to C and S is negative, as in aluminum. In those metals such
as copper in which ℓ decreases strongly with the energy, electrons in the cold region
have a longer mean free path, ℓ′ > ℓ as shown in Figure 4.36b. The net electron
migration is then from C to H and S is positive. Even this qualitative explanation is
not quite correct because n is not the same in H and C (diffusion changes n) and,
further, we neglected the change in the mean scattering time with the electron energy.
Nonetheless, the importance of scattering processes in determining the Seebeck effect
is clearly apparent.
The coefficient S is widely referred to as the thermoelectric power even though
this term is misleading, as it refers to a voltage difference rather than power. A more
appropriate recent term is the Seebeck coefficient. S is a material property that
depends on temperature, S = S(T), and is tabulated for many materials as a function
of temperature. Given the Seebeck coefficient S(T) for a material, Equation 4.29 yields
the voltage difference between two points where temperatures are To and T as follows:

both cases, around and above room temperature, the magnitude of S increases almost
linearly with the temperature. Typical values for Al and Cu and many pure metals,
as shown in Table 4.3, are only a few microvolts per 1 °C temperature difference,
that is, quite small.
The thermoelectric effect involves the same electrons around the Fermi level as
those that are normally involved in the electrical conduction process. We can make
an intuitive argument for the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient by considering
those electrons within about kT above EF. When an electron in the hot region at an
energy EF + k(T + ΔT) in Figure 4.35 diffuses over to the cold region where its
energy is EF + kT (ignoring the slight difference in EF), it brings with it an additional energy that is kΔT. If there are N electrons in total, then, due to Fermi–Dirac
statistics, the number of electrons in the range kT above EF is very roughly (kT∕EF)N.
Thus, the total additional energy carried over is (kΔT)(kT∕EF)N. The energy that is

transferred per electron is therefore (kΔT)(kT∕EF). There is a built-in field or a Seebeck voltage between the two ends as shown in Figure 4.35. The change in the energy
of the electron must be equivalent to eΔV, that is, the work involved in moving the
electron through a potential difference of ΔV. Setting eΔV = (kΔT)(kT∕EF), we can

where a negative sign has been inserted to ensure the cold end is negative for this

A proper explanation of the Seebeck effect has to consider how electrons around
the Fermi energy EF are scattered by lattice vibrations, crystal defects, impurities
and other imperfections. Various scattering processes that typically control the conductivity also influence the diffusion of electrons in a temperature gradient and hence
the Seebeck coefficient. The scattered electrons need empty states, which in turn
requires that we consider how the density of states changes with the energy as well
16
Intuitive derivations like this on the back of an envelope are quite well-known for getting the numerical factor
wrong among other concerns. Further, there is nothing in this argument that relies on how the energy
dependence of electron’s mean free path, or the energy dependence of its scattering time, plays a role in the
thermoelectric effect.

around EF. Moreover, in certain metals such as Ni, there are overlapping partially
filled bands and the Fermi level lies both inside the s-band and the d-band. An
electron can be scattered from one electronic band to another, for example from the
4s band to the 3d band. For many pure metals that have the Fermi level in a simple
band, the Seebeck coefficient can be described by the Mott-Jones equation that
incorporates the energy dependence of the mean free path of the electrons as discussed in Example 4.12.
The Seebeck effect above arises purely from the diffusion of electrons through
various scattering processes along a temperature gradient, and is called the electron
diffusion contribution. There is one more important driving force that migrates or
drags electrons through a temperature gradient. We know that lattice vibrations, that
is, thermal vibrations of the atoms that make up the crystal, are important in thermal
conduction in nonmetals. These thermal vibrations of the atoms set-up lattice waves
that travel in the crystal and are responsible for transporting energy from the hot to
the cold regions as we saw in Chapter 2. Lattice vibrations are generically called
phonons, which will be discussed in detail later. For now, all we need to know is
that lattice waves obviously also exist in metals, and lattice vibrations in the hot and
cold regions will not be in equilibrium. There will be a flow of lattice waves, phonons, from the hot to the cold region. As these lattice waves collide with electrons
(or vice versa), they will scatter the electrons and help push them along the temperature gradient. Thus, the collisions of phonons with electrons can cause conduction electrons to be dragged along with phonons and hence contribute to the
potential difference. This phenomenon is called phonon drag, and typically becomes
important at low temperatures.
Consider the S vs. T behavior for Al in Figure 4.37. The linear region above
300 K is due mainly to the diffusion of electrons. In the range 100–200 K, the
phonon drag effect becomes quite important, and this increases the magnitude of the
Seebeck voltage; phonons help migrate more electrons to the cold region. We can
write the Seebeck coefficient S of a pure metal as arising from diffusion and phonon
drag contributions as
S ≈ aT +

b
T

[4.33]

where a and b are constants, specific for each pure metal. The second term represents
the phonon drag contribution. Equation 4.33 does not apply at very low temperatures,
for example, below ∼100 K for Al as can be seen from Figure 4.37.
Suppose that we try to measure the voltage difference ΔV across the aluminum
rod by using aluminum connecting wires to a voltmeter as indicated in Figure 4.38a.
The same temperature difference now also exists across the aluminum connecting
wires; therefore an identical voltage also develops across the connecting wires,
opposing that across the aluminum rod. Consequently no net voltage will be registered by the voltmeter. It is, however, possible to read a net voltage difference, if the
connecting wires are of different material, that is, have a different Seebeck coefficient from that of aluminum. Then the thermoelectric voltage across this material
is different than that across the aluminum rod, as in Figure 4.38b.

The Seebeck effect is fruitfully utilized in the thermocouple (TC), shown in
Figure 4.38b, which uses two different metals with one junction maintained at a
reference temperature To and the other used to sense the temperature T. The voltage
across each metal element depends on its Seebeck coefficient. The potential difference
between the two wires will depend on SA − SB. By virtue of Equation 4.31, the electromotive force (emf) between the two wires, VAB = ΔVA − ΔVB, is then given by

The Seebeck coefficients of a few TC materials are shown in Figure 4.39. The
TC elements are usually chosen so that when they are used in pairs there is a large
difference in their Seebeck coefficients, that is, SAB is sufficiently large to generate
a reasonable emf over the temperature range of interest; and with sufficient sensitivity

to be able to measure small temperature changes. They are also chosen for their
stability and reproducibility; for example, stability against oxidation over long term
use. The K-type thermocouple uses a chromel-alumel pair, and SAB at 0 °C, from
Figure 4.39 is 22 μV∕K − (−18 μV∕K) that is 40 μV∕K; or an emf of 0.040 mV
over a 1 °C difference around 0 °C, which can be easily measured.
The output voltage from a TC pair obviously depends on the two metals used.
Instead of tabulating the emf from all possible pairs of materials in the world, which
would be a challenging task, engineers have tabulated the emfs available when a
given material is used with a reference metal which is chosen to be platinum. The
reference junction is kept at 0 °C (273.16 K), which corresponds to a mixture of ice
and water. The emf generated is then measured as a function of the junction temperature T as shown in Figure 4.40. The temperature (T1) of the two junctions at the
voltmeter must be kept the same and do not affect the emf. (Why?). Some typical
materials and their emfs are listed in Table 4.4.
According to Equation 4.34, the emf VAB generated by a TC depends on the
integration of SAB, that is SA − SB. In many cases, the individual Seebeck coefficients
depend linearly on the temperature, at least, over some temperature range. Thus, we
would expect SAB to depend linearly on T so that we can write SAB ≈ a0 + a1T, where
a0 and a1 are constants. We can now integrate SAB in Equation 4.34 from To to T to
find that VAB has a quadratic dependence on the temperature difference,
VAB ≈ c1ΔT + c2ΔT 2

[4.35]

where ΔT = T − To, is the temperature with respect to the reference temperature To
(273.16 K), and c1 and c2 are new constants for a given pair of TC materials; the
so-called thermocouple coefficients.

The inference from Equation 4.35 is that the emf output from the thermocouple
wires does not depend linearly on the temperature difference ΔT unless SAB is constant (i.e., a1 = 0). Figure 4.41 shows the emf output versus temperature for various
thermocouples. At 0 °C, by definition, the TC emf is zero. The K-type thermocouple,
the chromel-alumel pair, is a widely employed general-purpose thermocouple up to
about 1250 °C.
EXAMPLE 4.12

MOTT–JONES EQUATION The simplest expression for the Seebeck coefficient for a pure

where EF is the Fermi energy of the electrons, and x is a numerical parameter that characterizes the energy dependence of the mean free path of the electron. For example, if the mean
free path decreases with electron’s energy then x is negative. Apply this equation to Cu and
Al and obtain x for these two metals.
SOLUTION

The Al case is relatively straightforward since Table 4.3 gives S for Al as aT + b∕T where
a = −3.0 × 10−3 μV K−2, b = −235 μV. The aT term represents the diffusion of electrons
and corresponds to Equation 4.36 above. (The b∕T term is the phonon drag contribution.) Thus,

is at To, the probe junction is at T and the two measuring ends of the thermocouple are connected to the voltmeter terminals which are at a temperature T1. Show that the emf measured

EXAMPLE 4.13

SOLUTION

Each thermocouple end that is connected to the voltmeter forms a junction. We therefore have
two junctions at the voltmeter terminals. Provided that these two junctions are at the same
temperature T1, the measured emf is indeed independent of T1. Consider the voltage developed
across each element in Figure 4.40 and then add these going from the top voltmeter terminal
(at T1), around the circuit, from T1 to T to To to T1 at the bottom terminal, that is,

To and T and the integral of the difference of the Seebeck coefficients, SX − SPt; a distinct
advantage in temperature measurements. Further, if a point or a region within a TC element
is heated or cooled, the emf remains unchanged. We can run the TC wires through any temperature region and the emf measured will depend only on temperatures T and To of the two
junctions.17 It is assumed that each TC wire material is homogeneous.
Consider a copper-constantan (a Cu and Ni
alloy) thermocouple pair. The Seebeck coefficient of Cu is in Table 4.3 and the Seebeck
coefficient of constantan (CuNi alloy) between 273 − 650 K can be described approximately
by a second order polynomial of the form

We can substitute SCu = aT + b∕T with a and b from Table 4.3 and SCuNi that is given above,

We can now substitute all the values for the coefficients as well as To = 273 K and

or

9.291 mV

If we were to check standard copper-constantan thermocouple tables we would find
V = 9.286 mV, so that our calculation is to within ∼0.05% in this case. (The reason for the
unusually good agreement is that the values of S we have used for Cu and constantan are
reasonably well known in this temperature range.)
From Table 4.4, VCu-Pt = 1.83 mV whereas VCuNi-Pt = −7.45 mV, so that
VCu-CuNi = VCu-Pt − VCuNi-Pt = 1.83 mV − (−7.45 mV) = 9.28 mV

THERMIONIC EMISSION AND VACUUM
TUBE DEVICES

4.9.1 THERMIONIC EMISSION: RICHARDSON–DUSHMAN EQUATION
Even though most of us view vacuum tubes as electrical antiques, their basic principle of operation (electrons emitted from a heated cathode) still finds application
in cathode ray and X-ray tubes and various RF microwave vacuum tubes, such as
triodes, tetrodes, klystrons, magnetrons, and traveling wave tubes and amplifiers.
Therefore, it is useful to examine how electrons are emitted when a metal is heated.
When a metal is heated, the electrons become more energetic as the Fermi–Dirac
distribution extends to higher temperatures. Some of the electrons have sufficiently large
energies to leave the metal and become free. This situation is self-limiting because
as the electrons accumulate outside the metal, they prevent more electrons from
leaving the metal. (Put differently, emitted electrons leave a net positive charge
behind, which pulls the electrons in.) Consequently, we need to replenish the “lost”
electrons and collect the emitted ones, which is done most conveniently using the
vacuum tube arrangement in a closed circuit, as shown in Figure 4.42a. The cathode,
heated by a filament, emits electrons. A battery connected between the cathode and
the anode replenishes the cathode electrons and provides a positive bias to the anode to
collect the thermally emitted electrons from the cathode. The vacuum inside the tube
ensures that the electrons do not collide with the air molecules and become dispersed, with some even being returned to the cathode by collisions. Therefore, the
vacuum is essential. The current due to the flow of emitted electrons from the cathode to the anode depends on the anode voltage as indicated in Figure 4.42b. The
current increases with the anode voltage until, at sufficiently high voltages, all the

emitted electrons are collected by the anode and the current saturates. The saturation
current of the vacuum diode depends on the rate of thermionic emission of electrons
which we will derive below. The vacuum tube in Figure 4.42a acts as a rectifier
because there is no current flow when the anode voltage becomes negative; the anode
then repels the electrons.
We know that only those electrons with energies greater than EF + Φ (Fermi
energy + work function) which are moving toward the surface can leave the metal.
Their number depends on the temperature, by virtue of the Fermi–Dirac statistics.
Figure 4.43 shows how the concentration of conduction electrons with energies above
EF + Φ increases with temperature. We know that conduction electrons behave as
if they are free within the metal. We can therefore take the PE to be zero within the

[4.38]

Let dn(vx) be the number of electrons moving along x with velocities in the range
vx to (vx + dvx), with vx satisfying emission in Equation 4.38. These electrons will
be emitted when they reach the surface. Their number dn(vx) can be determined from
the density of states and the Fermi–Dirac statistics, since energy and velocity are
related through Equation 4.37. Close to EF + Φ, the Fermi–Dirac function will
approximate the Boltzmann distribution, f(E) = exp[−(E − EF)∕kT]. The number
dn(vx) is therefore at least proportional to this exponential energy factor.
The emission of dn(vx) electrons will give a thermionic current density dJx =
evxdn(vx). This must be integrated (summed) for all velocities satisfying Equation 4.38 to obtain the total current density Jx, or simply J. Since dn(vx) includes an
exponential energy function, the integration also leads to an exponential. The final
result is
J = BoT 2 exp(−

Φ

[4.39]

where Bo = 4πemek2∕h3. Equation 4.39 is called the Richardson–Dushman equation,18
and Bo is the Richardson–Dushman constant, whose value is 1.20 × 106 A m−2 K−2.

Sir Owen Richardson (1879–1959) won the Nobel prize in physics in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission,
which forms the basic principle of operation of electron tube devices. It can also be used to describe the emission
of electrons from the metal into a semiconductor as well in Schottky diodes as we will see in Chapter 5. Saul
Dushman (1883–1954) worked extensively on thermionic emission and vacuum tube devices at GE and wrote
several books.

4.9

THERMIONIC EMISSION AND VACUUM TUBE DEVICES

367

We see from Equation 4.39 that the emitted current from a heated cathode varies
exponentially with temperature and is sensitive to the work function Φ of the cathode
material. Both factors are apparent in Equation 4.39.
The wave nature of electrons means that when an electron approaches the surface, there is a probability that it may be reflected back into the metal, instead of
being emitted over the potential barrier. As the potential energy barrier becomes very
large, Φ → ∞, the electrons are totally reflected and there is no emission. Taking
into account that waves can be reflected, the thermionic emission equation is appropriately modified to
J = BeT 2 exp(−

Φ
kT )

[4.40]

Thermionic
emission

where Be = (1 − R)Bo is the emission constant and R is the reflection coefficient.
The value of R will depend on the material and the surface conditions. For most
metals, Be is about half of Bo, whereas for some oxide coatings on Ni cathodes used
in thermionic tubes, Be can be as low as 1 × 102 A m−2 K−2.
Equation 4.39 was derived by neglecting the effect of the applied field on the
emission process. Since the anode is positively biased with respect to the cathode,
the field will not only collect the emitted electrons (by drifting them to the anode),
but will also enhance the process of thermal emission by lowering the potential
energy barrier Φ.
There are many thermionic emission–based vacuum tubes that find applications
in which it is not possible or practical to use semiconductor devices, especially at
high-power and high-frequency operation at the same time, such as in radio and TV
broadcasting, radars, microwave communications; for example, a tetrode vacuum
tube in radio broadcasting equipment has to handle hundreds of kilowatts of power.
X-ray tubes operate on the thermionic emission principle in which electrons are
thermally emitted, and then accelerated and impacted on a metal target to generate
X-ray photons.

VACUUM TUBES It is clear from the Richardson–Dushman equation that to obtain an efficient thermionic cathode, we need high temperatures and low work functions. Metals such as
tungsten (W) and tantalum (Ta) have high melting temperatures but high work functions. For
example, for W, the melting temperature Tm is 3680 °C and its work function is about 4.5 eV.
Some metals have low work functions, but also low melting temperatures, a typical example
being Cs with Φ = 1.8 eV and Tm = 28.5 °C. If we use a thin film coating of a low Φ material, such as ThO or BaO, on a high-melting-temperature base metal such as W, we can
maintain the high melting properties and obtain a lower Φ. For example, Th on W has a
Φ = 2.6 eV and Tm = 1845 °C. Most vacuum tubes use indirectly heated cathodes that consist of the oxides of B, Sr, and Ca on a base metal of Ni. The operating temperatures for
these cathodes are typically 800 °C.
A certain transmitter-type vacuum tube has a cylindrical Th-coated W (thoriated tungsten) cathode, which is 4 cm long and 2 mm in diameter. Estimate the saturation current
if the tube is operated at a temperature of 1600 °C, given that the emission constant is
Be = 3.0 × 104 A m−2 K−2 for Th on W.

= 1.08 × 10 A m

The emission surface area is
A = π(diameter)(length) = π(2 × 10−3)(4 × 10−2) = 2.5 × 10−4 m2

so the saturation current, which is the maximum current obtainable (i.e., the thermionic
current), is
I = JA = (1.08 × 104 A m−2)(2.5 × 10−4 m2) = 2.7 A

4.9.2

SCHOTTKY EFFECT AND FIELD EMISSION

When a positive voltage is applied to the anode with respect to the cathode, the
electric field at the cathode helps the thermionic emission process by lowering the
PE barrier Φ. This is called the Schottky effect. Consider the PE of the electron
just outside the surface of the metal. The electron is pulled in by the effective
positive charge left in the metal. To represent this attractive PE we use the theorem
of image charges in electrostatics,19 which says that an electron at a distance x from
the surface of a conductor possesses a potential energy that is
PEimage (x) = −

e2
16πεox

[4.41]

where εo is the absolute permittivity.
This equation is valid for x much greater than the atomic separation a; otherwise,
we must consider the interaction of the electron with the individual ions. Further,
Equation 4.41 has a reference level of zero PE at infinity (x = ∞), but we defined
PE = 0 to be inside the metal. We must therefore modify Equation 4.41 to conform
to our definition of zero PE as a reference. Figure 4.44a shows how this “image PE”
varies with x in this system. In the region x < xo, we artificially bring PEimage(x) to
zero at x = 0, so our definition PE = 0 within the metal is maintained. Far away
from the surface, the PE is expected to be (EF + Φ) (and not zero, as in Equation 4.41),
so we modify Equation 4.41 to read
PEimage (x) = (EF + Φ) −

e2
16πεox

[4.42]

The present model, which takes PEimage(x) from 0 to (EF + Φ) along Equation 4.42,
is in agreement with the thermionic emission analysis, since the electron must still
overcome a PE barrier of EF + Φ to escape.
19
An electron at a distance x from the surface of a conductor experiences a force as if there were a positive
charge of +e at a distance 2x from it. The force is e2∕[4πεo(2x)2] or e2∕[16πεox2]. The result is called the image
charge theorem. Integrating the force gives the potential energy in Equation 4.41.

overall PE is the sum.

From the definition of potential, which is potential energy per unit charge, when
a voltage difference is applied between the anode and cathode, there is a PE gradient
just outside the surface of the metal, given by eV(x), or
PEapplied(x) = −exE

[4.43]

where E is the applied field and is assumed, for all practical purposes, to be uniform.
The variation of PEapplied(x) with x is depicted in Figure 4.44b. The total PE(x) of
the electron outside the metal is the sum of Equations 4.42 and 4.43, as sketched in
Figure 4.44c,
PE(x) = (EF + Φ) −

e2
− exE
16πεox

[4.44]

Note that the PE(x) outside the metal no longer goes up to (EF + Φ), and the
PE barrier against thermal emission is effectively reduced to (EF + Φeff), where Φeff
is a new effective work function that takes into account the effect of the applied
field. The new barrier (EF + Φeff) can be found by locating the maximum of PE(x),
that is, by differentiating Equation 4.44 and setting it to zero. The effective work
function in the presence of an applied field is therefore
Φ eff = Φ − (

e3E 1∕2
4πεo )

[4.45]

This lowering of the work function by the applied field, as predicted by Equation 4.45, is the Schottky effect. The current density is given by the Richardson–
Dushman equation, but with Φeff instead of Φ,
J = BeT 2 exp[ −

[4.46]

where βS = [e3∕4πεo]1∕2 is the Schottky coefficient, whose value is 3.79 × 10−5
(eV∕ √V m−1 ).
When the field becomes very large, for example, E > 107 V cm−1, the PE(x)
outside the metal surface may bend sufficiently steeply to give rise to a narrow PE
barrier. In this case, there is a distinct probability that an electron at an energy EF

will tunnel through the barrier and escape into vacuum, as depicted in Figure 4.45.
The likelihood of tunneling depends on the effective height Φeff of the PE barrier
above EF, as well as the width xF of the barrier at energy level EF. Since tunneling
is temperature independent, the emission process is termed field emission. The tunneling probability P was calculated in Chapter 3, and depends on Φeff and xF through
the equation20
P ≈ exp[

−2(2me Φ eff ) 1∕2xF

We can easily find xF by noting that when x = xF, PE(xF) is level with EF, as
shown in Figure 4.45. From Equation 4.44, when the field is very strong, then around
x ≈ xF the second term is negligible compared to the third, so putting x = xF and
PE(xF) = EF in Equation 4.44 yields Φ = eExF. Substituting xF = Φ∕eE in the equation for the tunneling probability P above, we obtain
P ≈ exp[ −

[4.47]

Equation 4.47 represents the probability P that an electron in the metal at EF will
tunnel out from the metal, as in Figure 4.45a and b, and become field-emitted. In a
more rigorous analysis we have to consider that electrons not just at EF but at energies below EF can also tunnel out (though with lower probability) and we have to
abandon the rough rectangular PE(x) approximation in Figure 4.45b.
20

In Chapter 3 we showed that the transmission probability T = To exp(−2αa) where α2 = 2me(Vo − E )∕ħ2 and a
is the barrier width. The pre-exponential constant To can be taken to be ∼1. Clearly Vo − E = Φeff since electrons
with E = EF are tunneling and a = xF.

To calculate the current density J we have to consider how many electrons are
moving toward the surface per second and per unit area, the electron flux, and then
multiply this flow by the probability that they will tunnel out. The final result of the
calculations is the Fowler–Nordheim equation,21 which still has the exponential

that depend on the work function Φ of the metal. Equation 4.48a can also be used
for field emission of electrons from a metal into an insulating material by using the
electron PE barrier ΦB from metal’s EF into the insulator’s conduction band (where
the electron is free) instead of Φ.
Notice that the field E in Equation 4.48a has taken over the role of temperature
in thermionic emission in Equation 4.40. Since field-assisted emission depends exponentially on the field via Equation 4.48a, it can be enhanced by shaping the cathode
into a cone with a sharp point where the field is maximum and the electron emission
occurs from the tip as depicted in Figure 4.45c. The field E in Equation 4.48a is the
effective field at the tip of the cathode that emits the electrons.
A popular field-emission tip design is based on the Spindt tip cathode, named
after its originator. As shown in Figure 4.46a, the emission cathode is an icebergtype sharp cone and there is a positively biased gate above it with a hole to extract
the emitted electrons. A positively biased anode draws and accelerates the electrons
passing through the gate toward it, which impinge on a phosphor screen to generate
light by cathodoluminescence, a process in which light is emitted from a material
when it is bombarded with electrons. Arrays of such electron field-emitters are used,

for example, in field emission displays (FEDs) to generate bright images with vivid
colors. Color is obtained by using red, green, and blue phosphors. The field at the
tip is controlled by the potential difference between the gate and the cathode, the
gate voltage VG, which therefore controls field emission. Since E ∝ VG, Equation 4.48a
can be written to obtain the emission current or the anode current IA as
IA = aV 2G exp(−

b
VG )

[4.49]

where a and b are constants that depend on the particular field-emitting structure
and cathode material. Figure 4.46b shows the dependence of IA on VG. There is a
very sharp increase with the voltage once the threshold voltages (around ∼45 V in
Figure 4.46b) are reached to start the electron emission. Once the emission is fully
operating, IA versus VG follows the Fowler–Nordheim emission. A plot of ln(IA∕V 2G)
versus 1∕VG is a straight line as shown in Figure 4.46c.
Field emission has a number of distinct advantages. It is much more power efficient than thermionic emission which requires heating the cathode to high temperatures. In principle, field emission can be operated at high frequencies (fast switching
times) by reducing various capacitances in the emission device or controlling the electron flow with a grid. Field emission has a number of important realized and potential
applications: field emission microscopy, cold cathodes in electron microscopes, X-ray
generators, microwave amplifiers, traveling wave tubes and klystrons, among others.
Typically molybdenum, tungsten, and hafnium have been used as the fieldemission tip materials. Figure 4.47a shows a typical molybdenum cone cathode in a
well with a metal grid. Arrays of such cones as shown in Figure 4.47b have been
used in various prototype devices such as a traveling wave tubes in microwave engineering. Microfabrication has lead to the use of Si emission tips as well. Good

electron emission characteristics have been also reported for diamond-like carbon
films. There has been a particular interest in using carbon nanotubes as emitters. A
carbon nanotube (CNT) is a very thin filament-like carbon molecule whose diameter is in the nanometer range but whose length can be quite long, e.g., 10–100 μm,
depending on how it is grown or prepared. A CNT is made by rolling a graphite
sheet into a tube and then capping the ends with hemispherical buckminsterfullerene
molecules (a half Buckyball) as shown in Figure 4.47c. Depending on how the graphite sheet is rolled up, the CNT may be a metal or a semiconductor22. The high aspect
ratio (length/diameter) of the CNT makes it an efficient electron emitter. If one were
to wonder what is the best shape for an efficient field emission tip, one might guess
that it should be a sharp cone with some suitable apex angle. However, it turns out
that the best emitter is actually a whisker-type thin filament with a rounded tip, much
like a CNT. Figure 4.47d shows an SEM photograph of a field-emission cathode
consisting of a single CNT emitter in a well and a polycrystalline silicon gate. Arrays
of such cold cathode emitters have been also used in various prototype tube devices
where they have replaced heated cathodes.
Field emission displays operate on the principle that electrons can be
readily emitted from a microscopic sharp point source (cathode) that is biased negatively with
respect to a neighboring electrode (gate or grid) as depicted in Figure 4.46a. Emitted electrons
impinge on colored phosphors on a screen and cause light emission by cathodoluminescence.
There are millions of these microscopic field emitters to constitute the image. A particular
field emission cathode in a field-emission-type flat panel display gives a current of 61.0 μA
when the voltage between the cathode and the grid is 50 V. The current is 279 μA when the
voltage is 58.2 V. What is the current when the voltage is 56.2 V?

Carbon nanotubes can be single-walled or multiwalled (when the graphite sheets are wrapped more than once)
and can have quite complicated structures. There is no doubt that they possess some remarkable properties, so
it is likely that CNTs will eventually be used in various engineering applications.

4.10.1 HARMONIC OSCILLATOR AND LATTICE WAVES

Quantum Harmonic Oscillator In the classical picture of a solid, the constituent

atoms are held together by bonds which can be represented by springs. According
to the kinetic molecular theory, the atoms in a solid are constantly vibrating about
their equilibrium positions by stretching and compressing their springs. The oscillations are assumed to be simple harmonic so that the average kinetic and potential
energies are the same. Figure 4.48a shows a 1D independent simple harmonic oscillator that represents an atom of mass M attached by springs to fixed neighbors. The
potential energy V(x) is a function of displacement x from equilibrium. For small
displacements, V(x) is parabolic in x, as indicated in Figure 4.48b, that is,

where β is a spring constant. The instantaneous energy, in principle, can be of any
value. Equation 4.50 neglects the cubic term and is therefore symmetric about the
equilibrium position at x = 0. It is called a harmonic approximation to the PE curve.
In modern physics, the energy of such a harmonic oscillator must be calculated

It is apparent that the minimum energy of the oscillator can never be zero but must
be a finite value that is E0 = 21ħω. This energy is called the zero-point energy. As the
temperature approaches 0 K, the harmonic oscillator would have an energy of E0 and
not zero. The energy levels are equally spaced by an amount ħω, which represents the
amount of energy absorbed or emitted by the oscillator when it is excited and de-excited
to a neighboring energy level. The vibrational energies of a molecule due to its atoms
vibrating relative to each other, e.g., the vibrations of the Cl2 molecule in which the
Cl–Cl bond is stretched and compressed, can also be described by Equation 4.52.

Phonons Atoms in a solid are coupled to each other by bonds. Atomic vibrations are

therefore also coupled. These coupled vibrations lead to waves that involve cooperative
vibrations of many atoms and cannot be represented by independent vibrations of
individual atoms. Figure 4.49a shows a chain of atoms in a crystal. As an atom vibrates
it transfers its energy to neighboring vibrating atoms and the coupled vibrations produce traveling wave-trains in the crystal.24 (Consider grabbing and strongly vibrating
the first atom in the atomic chain in Figure 4.49a. Your vibrations will be coupled and
transferred by the springs to neighboring atoms in the chain along x.) Two examples
are shown in Figure 4.49b and c. In the first, the atomic vibrations are parallel to the
direction of propagation x and the wave is a longitudinal wave. In the second, the vibrations are transverse to the direction of propagation and the corresponding wave is a
transverse wave. Suppose that xr is the position of the rth atom in the absence of
vibrations, that is, xr = ra, where r is an integer from 0 to N, the number of atoms in
the chain, as indicated in Figure 4.49a. By writing the mechanical equations (Newton’s
second law) for the coupled atoms in Figure 4.49a, we can show that the displacement
ur from equilibrium at a location xr is given by a traveling-wave-like behavior,25
ur = Aexp[ j(ωt − Kx)]
24

[4.53]

In the presence of coupling, the individual atoms do not execute simple harmonic motion.
The exponential notation for a wave is convenient, but we have to consider only the real part to actually
represent the wave in the physical world.

where A is the amplitude, K is a wavevector, and ω is the angular frequency. Notice
that the Kxr term is very much like the usual kx phase term of a traveling wave
propagating in a continuous medium; the only difference is that kxr exists at discrete
xr locations. The wave-train described by Equation 4.53 in the crystal is called a
lattice wave. Along the x direction it has a wavelength Λ = 2π∕K over which the
longitudinal (or transverse) displacement ur repeats itself. The displacement ur repeats
itself at one location over a time period 2π∕ω. A wave traveling in the opposite
direction to Equation 4.53 is of course also possible. Indeed, two oppositely traveling
waves of the same frequency can interfere to set up a stationary wave which is also
a lattice wave.
The lattice wave described by Equation 4.53 is a harmonic oscillation with a
frequency ω that itself has no coupling to another lattice wave. The energy possessed
by this lattice vibration is quantized in much the same way as the energy of the
quantized harmonic oscillator in Equation 4.52. The energy of a lattice vibration
therefore can only be multiples of ħω above the zero-point energy, 12 ħω. The quantum of energy ħω is therefore the smallest unit of lattice vibrational energy that can
be added or subtracted from a lattice wave. The quantum of lattice vibration ħω is
called a phonon in analogy with the quantum of electromagnetic radiation, the photon. One can imagine a phonon to be a traveling lattice wave just as a photon can be
visualized as a traveling electromagnetic wave. Whenever a lattice vibration interacts
with another lattice vibration, an electron or a photon, in the crystal, it does so as
if it had possessed a momentum of ħK. Thus,
Ephonon = ħω = hf
pphonon = ħK

[4.54]
[4.55]

The momentum of the phonon is sometimes called a phonon crystal momentum
because the lattice wave itself does not have a real physical momentum; it behaves
as though it had a momentum ħK in its interactions inside the crystal.
The frequency of vibrations ω and the wavevector K of a lattice wave are related.
If we were to use Equation 4.53 in the mechanical equations that describe the coupled atomic vibrations (see Example 4.17), we would find that

[4.56]

which relates ω and K and is called the dispersion relation. Figure 4.50 shows
how the frequency ω of the lattice waves increases with increasing wavevector K,
or decreasing wavelength Λ. From Equation 4.56, there can be no frequencies
higher than ωmax = 2(β∕M)1∕2, which is the lattice cut-off frequency. Both longitudinal and transverse waves exhibit this type of dispersion relationship shown
in Figure 4.50a though their exact ω–K curves would be different depending on
the nature of interatomic bonding and the crystal structure. The dispersion relation
in Equation 4.56 is periodic in K with a period 2π∕a. Only values of K in the
range −π∕a < K < π∕a are physically meaningful. A point A with KA is the same
as a point B with KB because we can shift K by the period, 2π∕a as shown in
Figure 4.50a.

crystal as in Figure 4.51 with many atoms. We will take N to be large and ignore

when alternating atoms in the crystal are moving in opposite directions which corresponds to 12 Λ = a, that is, q = N, as shown in Figure 4.51. In terms of the wavevector, K = 2π∕Λ = π∕a. Smaller wavelengths or longer wavevectors are meaningless
and correspond to shifting K by a multiple of 2π∕a. Since N is large, the ω versus
K curve in Figure 4.50a consists of very finely separated distinct points, each corresponding to a particular q, analogous to the energy levels in an energy band.
The above ideas for the linear chain of atoms can be readily extended to a 3D
crystal. If Lx, Ly, and Lz are the sides of the solid along the x, y, and z axes, with
Nx, Ny, and Nz number of atoms, respectively, then the wavevector components along

bond with the left neighbor stretches by (ur − ur−1). Its bond with the right neighbor stretches
by (ur+1 − ur). The left spring exerts a force β(ur − ur−1), and the right spring exerts a force
β(ur+1 − ur). The net force on the rth atom is mass × acceleration,

This is the wave equation that describes the coupled longitudinal vibrations of the atoms
in the crystal. A similar expression can also be derived for transverse vibrations. We can
substitute Equation 4.53 in Equation 4.60 to show that Equation 4.53 is indeed a solution of
the wave equation. It is assumed that the crystal response is linear, that is, the net force is
proportional to net displacement.

which is a constant. It is the slope of the straight-line region of ω versus K curve for small K
values in Figure 4.50. Furthermore, the elastic modulus Y depends on the slope of the net force
versus displacement curve as derived in Example 1.5. From Equation 4.50, FN = dV∕dx = βx
and hence Y = β∕a. Moreover, each atom occupies a volume of a3, so the density ρ is M∕a3.

The relationship has to be modified for an actual crystal incorporating a small numerical
factor multiplying Y. Aluminum has a density of 2.7 g cm−3 and Y = 70 GPa, so the longwavelength longitudinal velocity from Equation 4.62 is 5092 m s−1. The sound velocity in Al
is 5100 m s−1, which is very close.

4.10.2 DEBYE HEAT CAPACITY
The heat capacity of a solid represents the increase in the internal energy of the
crystal per unit increase in the temperature. The increase in the internal energy is
due to an increase in the energy of lattice vibrations. This is generally true for all
the solids except metals at very low temperatures where the heat capacity is due
to the electrons near the Fermi level becoming excited to higher energies. For most
practical temperature ranges of interest, the heat capacity of solids is determined by
the excitation of lattice vibrations. The molar heat capacity Cm is the increase in the
internal energy Um of a crystal of NA atoms per unit increase in the temperature at
constant volume,27 that is, Cm = dUm∕dT.
The simplest approach to calculating the average energy is first to assume that
all the lattice vibrational modes have the same frequency ω. (We will account for
27

Constant volume in the definition means that the heat added to the system increases the internal energy
without doing mechanical work by changing the volume.

where P(En) is the probability that the vibration has the energy En which is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Thus we can use P(En) ∝ exp(−En∕kT) and
En = (n + 12 )ħω in Equation 4.63. We can drop the zero-point energy as this does
not affect the heat capacity (which deals with energy changes). The substitution and
calculation of Equation 4.63 yields the vibrational mean energy at a frequency ω,

This energy increases with temperature. Each phonon has an energy of ħω. Thus,
the phonon concentration in the crystal increases with temperature; increasing the
temperature creates more phonons.
To find the internal energy due to all the lattice vibrations we must also consider
how many modes there are at various frequencies, that is, the distribution of the
modes over the possible frequencies, the spectrum of the vibrations. Suppose that
g(ω) is the number of modes per unit frequency, that is, g(ω) is the density of
vibrational states or modes. Then g(ω) dω is the number of states in the range dω.
The internal energy Um of all lattice vibrations for 1 mole of solid is
Um =

ωmax

∫ E(ω)g(ω) dω

The integration is up to a certain allowed maximum frequency ωmax (Figure 4.50a).
The density of states g(ω) for the lattice vibrations can be found in a similar fashion
to the density of states for electrons in an energy band. For example, in one dimension, we would need to calculate how many vibrational modes of the type shown in
Figure 4.51 would have frequencies in the range ω to ω + dω. We need to do this
calculation in three dimensions for vibrational modes that are characterized by three
integers, as in Equation 4.59 similar to an electron in a 3D potential energy well.
The final result is,

g(ω) ≈ 2 3

where v is the mean velocity of longitudinal and transverse waves in the solid and
V is the volume of the crystal. Figure 4.53 shows the spectrum g(ω) for a real crystal such as Cu and the expression in Equation 4.66. The maximum frequency is ωmax
and is determined by the fact that the total number of modes up to ωmax must be
3NA. It is called the Debye frequency. Thus, integrating g(ω) up to ωmax we find,
ωmax ≈ v(6π2NA∕V)1∕3

Figure 4.54 represents the constant-volume molar heat capacity Cm of nearly all
crystals, Equation 4.69, as a function of temperature, normalized with respect to
the Debye temperature. The Dulong–Petit rule of Cm = 3R is only obeyed when
T > TD. Notice that Cm at T = 0.5TD is 0.825(3R) whereas at T = TD it is 0.952(3R).
For most practical purposes, Cm is to within 6 percent of 3R when the temperature
is at 0.9TD. For example, for copper TD = 315 K and above about 0.9TD, that is,
above 283 K (or 10 °C), Cm ≈ 3R, as borne out by experiments.28 Table 4.5 provides
typical values for TD, and heat capacities for a few selected elements. It is left as an
exercise to check the accuracy of Equation 4.69 for predicting the heat capacity given
the TD values. At the lowest temperatures when T ≪ TD, Equation 4.69 predicts that

Sometimes it is stated that the Debye temperature is a characteristics temperature for each material at which
all the atoms are able to possess vibrational kinetic energies in accordance with the Maxwell equipartition of
energy principle; that is, the average vibrational kinetic energy will be 23 kT per atom and average potential
energy will also be 23 kT . This means that the average energy per atom is 3kT, and hence the heat capacity is
3kNA or 3R per mole which is the Dulong–Petit rule.

Cm ∝ T 3, and this is indeed observed in low-temperature heat capacity experiments
on a variety of crystals.29
It is useful to provide a physical picture of the Debye model inherent in Equation 4.69. As the temperature increases from near zero, the increase in the crystal’s
vibrational energy is due to more phonons being created and higher frequencies
being excited. The phonon concentration increases as T 3, and the mean phonon
energy increases as T. Thus, the internal energy increases as T 4. At temperatures
above TD, increasing the temperature creates more phonons but does not increase the

mean phonon energy and does not excite higher frequencies. All frequencies up to
ωmax have now been excited. The internal energy increases only due to more phonons
being created. The phonon concentration and hence the internal energy increase as
T; the heat capacity is constant as expected from Equation 4.69.
It is apparent that, above the Debye temperature, the increase in temperature
leads to the creation of more phonons. In Chapters 1 and 2, using classical concepts
only, we had mentioned that increasing the temperature increases the magnitude of
atomic vibrations. This simple and intuitive classical concept in terms of modern
physics corresponds to creating more phonons with temperature. We can use the
photon analogy from Chapter 3. When we increase the intensity of light of a given
frequency, classically we simply increase the electric field (magnitude of the vibrations), but in modern physics we have to increase the number of photons flowing
per unit area.

SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY OF Si Find the specific heat capacity cs of a silicon crystal at
room temperature given TD = 625 K for Si.

EXAMPLE 4.18

SOLUTION

At room temperature, T = 300 K, (T∕TD) = 0.48, and, from Figure 4.54, the molar heat
capacity is
Cm = 0.81(3R) = 20.2 J K−1 mol−1

If Mat = 28.9 g mol−1 is the atomic mass of Si, the specific heat capacity cs from the
Debye curve is
cs =

Cm
(0.81 × 25 J K−1 mol−1 )
≈
= 0.72 J K−1 g−1
Mat
(28.09 g mol−1 )

The experimental value of 0.70 J K−1 g−1 is very close to the Debye value.

Example 4.18 applied Equation 4.69, the Debye
molar heat capacity Cm, to the silicon crystal in which all atoms are of the same type. It was
relatively simple to calculate the specific heat capacity cs (what is really used in engineering)
from the molar heat capacity Cm by using cs = Cm∕Mat where Mat is the atomic mass of the
type of atom (only one) in the crystal. When the crystal has two types of atoms, we must
modify the specific heat capacity derivation. We can still keep the symbol Cm to represent
the Debye molar heat capacity given in Equation 4.69. Consider a GaAs crystal that has NA
units of GaAs, that is, 1 mole of GaAs. There will be 1 mole (NA atoms) of Ga and 1 mole
of As atoms. To a reasonable approximation we can assume that each mole of Ga and As
contributes a Cm amount of heat capacity so that the total heat capacity of 1 mole GaAs will
be Cm + Cm or 2Cm, a maximum of 50 J K−1 mol−1. The total mass of this 1 mole of GaAs
is MGa + MAs. Thus, the specific heat capacity of GaAs is

where M = (MGa + MAs )∕2 is the average atomic mass of the constituent atoms. Although
we derived cs for GaAs, it can also be applied to other compounds by suitably calculating an
average atomic mass M. GaAs has a Debye temperature TD = 344 K, so that at a room
temperature of 300 K, T∕TD = 0.87, and from Figure 4.54, Cm∕(3R) = 0.94. Therefore,

At −40 °C, T∕TD = 0.68, and Cm∕(3R) = 0.90, so the new cs = (0.90∕0.94)(0.325) =
0.311 J K−1 g−1, which is not a large change in cs.
The heat capacity per unit volume Cv can be found from Cv = cs ρ, where ρ is the density.
Thus, at 300 K, Cv = (0.325 J K−1 g−1)(5.32 g cm−3) = 1.73 J K−1 cm−3. The calculated cs
match the reported experimental values very closely.

The above equation is usually called the phonon distribution function. At low temperatures,
the exponential term dominates the denominator, and we get nph = exp(−ħω∕kT), that is,
the phonon population increases exponentially with T. At high temperatures, (ħω∕kT) is
small and we can expand the exponential term in Equation 4.71 as 1 + (ħω∕kT) and find
nph = kT∕ħω. The phonon population at a given frequency is directly proportional to the
temperature; nph ∝ T. (Equation 4.71 is known as the Bose-Einstein distribution.)

4.10.3 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF NONMETALS
In nonmetals the heat transfer involves lattice vibrations, that is, phonons. The heat
absorbed in the hot region increases the amplitudes of the lattice vibrations, which
is the same as generating more phonons. These new phonons travel toward the cold
regions and thereby transport the lattice energy from the hot to cold end. The thermal
conductivity κ measures the rate at which heat can be transported through a medium
per unit area per unit temperature gradient. It is proportional to the rate at which a
medium can absorb energy; that is, κ is proportional to the heat capacity. κ is also
proportional to the rate at which phonons are transported which is determined by
their mean velocity vph. In addition, of course, κ is proportional to the mean free

path ℓph that a phonon has to travel before losing its momentum just as the electrical
conductivity is proportional to the electron’s mean free path. A rigorous classical
treatment gives κ as
1
κ = Cvvphℓph
3

[4.72]

where Cv is the heat capacity per unit volume. The mean free path ℓph depends on
various processes that can scatter the phonons and hinder their propagation along
the direction of heat flow. Phonons collide with other phonons, crystal defects, impurities, and crystal surfaces.
The mean phonon velocity vph is constant and approximately independent of
temperature. At temperatures above the Debye temperature, Cv is constant and,
thus, κ ∝ ℓph. The mean free path of phonons at these temperatures is determined
by phonon–phonon collisions, that is, phonons interacting with other phonons as
depicted in Figure 4.55. Since the phonon concentration nph increases with temperature,
nph ∝ T, the mean free path decreases as ℓph ∝ 1∕T. Thus, κ decreases with increasing temperature as observed for most crystals at sufficiently high temperatures.
The phonon–phonon collisions that are responsible for limiting the thermal conductivity, that is, scattering the phonon momentum in the opposite direction to the
heat flow, are due to the unharmonicity (asymmetry) of the interatomic potential
energy curve. Stated differently, the net force F acting on an atom is not simply βx
but also has an x2 term; it is nonlinear. The greater the asymmetry or nonlinearity,
the larger is the effect of such momentum flipping collisions. The same asymmetry
that is responsible for thermal expansion of solids is also responsible for determining the thermal conductivity. When two phonons 1 and 2 interact in a crystal region
as in Figure 4.55, the nonlinear behavior and the periodicity of the lattice cause a
new phonon 3 to be generated. This new phonon 3 has the same energy as the sum of
1 and 2, but it is traveling in the wrong direction! (The frequency of 3 is the sum
of the frequencies of 1 and 2.)
At low temperatures there are two factors. The phonon concentration is too low
for phonon–phonon collisions to be significant. Instead, the mean free path ℓph is
determined by phonon collisions with crystal imperfections, most significantly, crystal surfaces and grain boundaries. Thus, ℓph depends on the sample geometry and
crystallinity. Further, as we expect from the Debye model, Cv depends on T 3, so κ

For small specimens, the above phonon mean free path will be comparable to the sample
size, which means that ℓph will actually be limited by the sample size. Consequently κ will
depend on the sample dimensions, being smaller for smaller samples, similar to the dependence of the electrical conductivity of thin films on the film thickness.

4.10.4 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
Except at low temperatures, the electrical conductivity of metals is primarily controlled
by scattering of electrons around EF by lattice vibrations, that is, phonons. These electrons have a speed vF = (2EF∕me)1∕2 and a momentum of magnitude mevF. We know
that the electrical conductivity σ is proportional to the mean collision time τ of the
electrons, that is, σ ∝ τ. This scattering time assumes that each scattering process is
100 percent efficient in randomizing the electron’s momentum, that is, destroying the
momentum gained from the field, which may not be the case. If it takes on average
N collisions to randomize the electron’s momentum, and τ is the mean time between
the scattering events, then the effective scattering time is simply Nτ and σ ∝ Nτ. (1∕N
indicates the efficiency of each scattering process in randomizing the velocity.)
Figure 4.57 shows an example in which an electron with an initial momentum
pi collides with a lattice vibration of momentum ħK. The result of the interaction is
that the electron’s momentum is deflected through a small angle θ to pf which still
has a component along the original direction x. This is called a low-angle scattering
process. It will take many such collisions to reverse the electron’s momentum which
corresponds to flipping the momentum along the +x direction to the −x direction.
Recall that the momentum gained from the field is actually very small compared
with the momentum of the electron which is mevF. A scattered electron must have
an energy close to EF because lower energy states are filled. Thus, pi and pf have
approximately the same magnitude pi = pf = mevF as shown in Figure 4.57.
At temperatures above the Debye temperature, we can assume that most of the
phonons are vibrating with the Debye frequency ωmax, and the phonon concentration
nph increases as T. These phonons have sufficient energies and momenta to fully
scatter the electron on impact. Thus,
σ ∝ τ ∝

[4.73a]

When T < TD, the phonon concentration follows nph ∝ T 3, and the mean phonon
energy Eph ∝ T , because, as the temperature is raised, higher frequencies are excited.
However, these phonons have low energy and small momenta, thus they only cause
small-angle scattering processes as in Figure 4.57. The average phonon momentum

ħK is also proportional to the temperature (recall that at low frequencies Figure 4.50a
shows that ħω ∝ ħK). It will take many such collisions, say N, to flip the electron’s
momentum by 2mevF from +mevF to −mevF. During each collision, a phonon of
momentum ħK is absorbed as shown in Figure 4.57. Thus, if all phonons deflected
the electron in the same angular direction, the collisions would sequentially add to θ
in Figure 4.57, and we will need (2mevF)∕(ħK) number of steps to flip the electron’s
momentum. The actual collisions add θ’s randomly and the process is similar to
particle diffusion, random walk, in Section 1.8.2 (L2 = Na2, where L = displaced
distance after N jumps and a = jump step). Thus,

BAND THEORY OF METALS: ELECTRON
DIFFRACTION IN CRYSTALS

A rigorous treatment of the band theory of solids involves extensive quantum
mechanical analysis and is beyond the scope of this book. However, we can attain
a satisfactory understanding through a semiquantitative treatment.
We know that the wavefunction of the electron moving freely along x in space
is a traveling wave of the spatial form ψk(x) ∝ exp( jkx), where k is the wavevector
k = 2π∕λ of the electron and ħk is its momentum in the crystal. Here, ψk(x) represents
a traveling wave because it must be multiplied by exp(−jωt), where ω = E∕ħ, to get
the total wavefunction Ψ(x, t) ∝ exp[ j(kx − ωt)].
We will assume that an electron moving freely within the crystal and within a
given energy band should also have a traveling wave type of wavefunction,
ψk(x) = A exp( jkx)
[4.74]
where k is the electron wavevector in the crystal and A is the amplitude. This is a
reasonable expectation, since, to a first order, we can take the PE of the electron
inside a solid as zero, V = 0. Yet, the PE must be large outside, so the electron is
contained within the crystal. When the PE is zero, Equation 4.74 is a solution to the
Schrödinger equation. The momentum of the electron described by the traveling wave
Equation 4.74 is then ħk and its energy is
(ħk) 2
Ek =

where me is the mass of the electron (Equation 4.75 corresponds to the familiar
energy versus momentum relation for a free particle.)

Figure 4.58 An electron wave propagation
through a simple lattice.
For certain k values, the reflected waves at
successive atomic planes reinforce each
other, giving rise to a reflected wave traveling
in the backward direction. The electron
cannot then propagate through the crystal.

The electron, as a traveling wave, will freely propagate through the crystal.
However, not all traveling waves, can propagate in the lattice. The electron cannot
have any k value in Equation 4.74 and still move through the crystal. Waves can be
reflected and diffracted, whether they are electron waves, X-rays, or visible light.
Diffraction occurs when reflected waves interfere constructively. Certain k values
will cause the electron wave to be diffracted, preventing the wave from propagating.
The simplest illustration that certain k values will result in the electron wave
being diffracted is shown in Figure 4.58 for a hypothetical linear lattice in which
diffraction is simply a reflection (what we call diffraction becomes Bragg reflection).
The electron is assumed to be propagating in the forward direction along x with a
traveling wave function of the type in Equation 4.74. At each atom, some of this
wave will be reflected. At A, the reflected wave is A′ and has a magnitude A′. If the
reflected waves A′, B′, and C′ reinforce each other, a full reflected wave will be
created, traveling in the backward direction. The reflected waves A′, B′, C′, . . . will
reinforce each other if the path difference between A′, B′, C′, . . . is nλ, where λ is
the wavelength and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is an integer. When wave B′ reaches A′, it has
traveled an additional distance of 2a. The path difference between A′ and B′ is
therefore 2a. For A′ and B′ to reinforce each other, that is for constructive interference, we need
2a = nλ

n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

Substituting λ = 2π∕k, we obtain the condition in terms of k
k=

nπ
a

n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

[4.76]

Thus, whenever k is such that it satisfies the condition in Equation 4.76, all the
reflected waves reinforce each other and produce a backward-traveling, reflected
wave of the following form (with a negative k value):
ψ−k(x) = A exp(−jkx)

[4.77]

This wave will also probably suffer a reflection, since its k satisfies Equation 4.76,
and the reflections will continue. The crystal will then contain waves traveling in
the forward and backward directions. These waves will interfere to give standing
waves inside the crystal. Hence, whenever the k value satisfies Equation 4.76, traveling

waves cannot propagate through the lattice. Instead, there can only be standing
waves. For k satisfying Equation 4.76, the electron wavefunction consists of waves
ψk and ψ−k interfering in two possible ways to give two possible standing waves:
ψc (x) = A exp( jkx) + A exp(−jkx) = Ac cos(
ψs (x) = A exp( jkx) − A exp(−jkx) = As sin(

[4.79]

The probability density distributions ∣ψc(x)∣2 and ∣ψs(x)∣2 for the two standing
waves are shown in Figure 4.59. The first standing wave ψc(x) is at a maximum
on the ion cores, and the other ψs(x) is at a maximum between the ion cores. Note
also that both the standing waves ψc(x) and ψs(x) are solutions to the Schrödinger
equation.
The closer the electron is to a positive nucleus, the lower is its electrostatic PE,
by virtue of −e2∕4πεor. The PE of the electron distribution in ψc(x) is lower than
that in ψs(x), because the maxima for ψc(x) are nearer the positive ions. Therefore, the
energy of the electron in ψc(x) is lower than that of the electron in ψs(x), or Ec < Es.
It is not difficult to evaluate the energies Ec and Es. The kinetic energy of the
electron is the same in both ψc(x) and ψs(x), because these wavefunctions have the
same k value and KE is given by (ħk)2∕2me. However, there is an electrostatic PE
arising from the interaction of the electron with the ion cores, and this PE is different for the two wavefunctions. Suppose that V(x) is the electrostatic PE of the electron at position x. We then must find the average, using the probability density
distribution. Given that ∣ψc(x)∣2 dx is the probability of finding the electron at x in
dx, the potential energy Vc of the electron is simply V(x) averaged over the entire
linear length L of the crystal. Thus, the potential energy Vc for ψc(x) is
Vc =

[4.80]

where Vn is the numerical result of the integration, which depends on k = nπ∕a or
n, by virtue of Equation 4.78. The integration in Equation 4.80 is a negative number
that depends on n. We do not need to evaluate the integral, as we only need its final
numerical result.
Using ∣ψs(x)∣2, we can also find Vs, the PE associated with ψc(x). The result is
that Vs is a positive quantity given by +Vn, where Vn is again the numerical result
of the integration in Equation 4.80, which depends on n. The energies of the

Clearly, whenever k has the critical values nπ∕a, there are only two possible
values Ec and Es for the electron’s energy as determined by Equations 4.81 and 4.82;
no other energies are allowed in between. These two energies are separated by 2Vn.
Away from the critical k values determined by k = nπ∕a, the electron simply propagates as a traveling wave; the wave does not get reflected. The energy is then given
by the free-running wave solution to the Schrödinger equation, that is, Equation 4.75,
Ek =

(ħk) 2
2me

Away from k =

nπ
a

[4.83]

It seems that the energy of the electron increases parabolically with k along
Equation 4.83 and then suddenly, at k = nπ∕a, it suffers a sharp discontinuity
and increases parabolically again. Although the discontinuities at the critical points
k = nπ∕a are expected, by virtue of the Bragg reflection of waves, reflection effects
will still be present to a certain extent, even within a small range around k = nπ∕a.
The individual reflections shown in Figure 4.58 do not occur exactly at the origins
of the atoms at x = a, 2a, 3a, . . . . Rather, they occur over some distance, since the
wave must interact with the electrons within the atoms to be reflected. We therefore
expect the E–k behavior to deviate from Equation 4.83 in the neighborhood of the
critical points, even if k is not exactly nπ∕a. Figure 4.60 shows the E–k behavior we
expect, based on these arguments.
In Figure 4.60, we notice that there are certain energy ranges occurring at
k = ±(nπ∕a) in which there are no allowed energies for the electron. As we saw previously, the electron cannot possess an energy between Ec and Es at k = π∕a. These
energy ranges form energy gaps at the critical points k = ±(nπ∕a).
The range of k values from zero to the first energy gap at k = ±(π∕a) defines
a zone of k values called the first Brillouin zone. The zone between the first and
second energy gap defines the second Brillouin zone, and so on. The Brillouin zone
boundaries therefore identify where the energy discontinuities, or gaps, occur along
the k axis.
Electron motion in the 3D crystal can be readily understood based on the concepts described here. For simplicity, we consider an electron propagating in a 2D
crystal, which is analogous, for example, to propagation in the xy plane of a crystal,
as depicted in Figure 4.61. For certain k values and in certain directions, the electron
will suffer diffraction and will be unable to propagate in the crystal.
Suppose that the electron’s k vector along x is k1. Whenever k1 = ±nπ∕a, the
electron will be diffracted by the planes perpendicular to x, that is, the (10) planes.30
30
We use Miller indices in two dimensions by dropping the third digit but keeping the same interpretation. The
direction along x is [10] and the plane perpendicular to x is (10).

There are discontinuities in the energy at k = ±nπ∕a, where the waves suffer Bragg reflections
in the crystal. For example, there can be no energy value for the electron between Ec and Es.
Therefore, Es − Ec is an energy gap at k = ±π∕a. Away from the critical k values, the E–k behavior
is like that of a free electron, with E increasing with k as E = (ħk)2∕2me. In a solid, these energies
fall within an energy band.

Similarly, it will be diffracted by the (01) planes whenever its k vector along y is
k2 = ±nπ∕a. The electron can also be diffracted by the (11) planes, whose separation is a∕√2. If the component of k perpendicular to the (11) plane is k3, then
whenever k3 = ±nπ(√2∕a) , the electron will experience diffraction. These diffraction conditions can all be expressed through the Bragg diffraction condition 2d
sin θ = nλ, or
k sin θ =

d

[4.84]

where d is the interplanar separation and n is an integer; d = a for (10) planes, and
d = a∕√2 for (11) planes. (See Appendix A for the derivation of Equation 4.84 for
the diffraction of X-rays.)
When we plot the energy of the electron as a function of k, we must consider
the direction of k, since the diffraction behavior in Equation 4.84 depends on sin θ.
Along x, at θ = 0, the energy gap occurs at k = ±(nπ∕a). Along θ = 45°, it is at
k = ±nπ(√2∕a), which is farther away. The E–k behavior for the electron in the 2D
lattice is shown in Figure 4.62 for the [10] and [11] directions. The figure shows
that the first energy gap along x, in the [10] direction, is at k = π∕a. Along the [11]
direction, which is at 45° to the x axis, the first gap is at k = π √2∕a.
When we consider the overlap of the energy bands along [10] and [11], in the
case of a metal, there is no apparent energy gap. The electron can always find any
energy simply by changing its direction.
The effects of overlap between energy bands and of energy gaps in different
directions are illustrated in Figure 4.63. In the case of a semiconductor, the energy
gap along [10] overlaps that along [11], so there is an overall energy gap. The electron in the semiconductor cannot have an energy that falls into this energy gap.

The Brillouin zones identify the boundaries where there are

The first and second Brillouin zones for the 2D lattice of Figure 4.61 are shown
in Figure 4.64. The zone boundaries mark the occurrences of energy gaps in k space
(space defined by k axes along the x and y directions). When we look at the E–k
behavior, we must consider the crystal directions. This is most conveniently done by
plotting energy contours in k space, as in Figure 4.65. Each contour connects all
those values of k that possess the same energy. A point such as P on an energy
contour gives the value of k for that energy along the direction OP. Initially, the
energy contours are circles, as the energy follows (ħk)2∕2me behavior, whatever the
direction of k. However, near the critical values, that is, near the Brillouin zone
boundaries, E increases more slowly than the parabolic relationship, as is apparent
in Figure 4.60. Therefore, the circles begin to bulge as critical k values are approached.

Each contour represents the same energy value. Any point P on the contour gives the values of kx and ky for that energy
in that direction from O. For point P, E = 3 eV and OP along [11] is k. (a) In a metal, the lowest energy in the second zone
(5 eV) is lower than the highest energy (6 eV) in the first zone. There is an overlap of energies between the Brillouin
zones. (b) In a semiconductor or an insulator, there is an energy gap between the highest energy contour (6 eV) in the
first zone and the lowest energy contour (10 eV) in the second zone.

In Figure 4.65, the high-energy contours are concentrated in the corners of the zone,
simply because the critical value is reached last along [11]. The energy contours do
not continue smoothly across the zone boundary, because of the energy discontinuity in the E–k relationship at the boundary. Indeed, Figure 4.62 shows that the lowest energy in the second Brillouin zone may be lower than the highest energy in the
first Brillouin zone.
There are two cases of interest. In the first, there is no apparent energy gap, as
in Figure 4.65a, which corresponds to Figure 4.63a. The electron can have any
energy value. In the second case, there is a range of energies that are not allowed,
as shown in Figure 4.65b, which corresponds to Figure 4.63b.
In three dimensions, the E–k energy contour in Figure 4.65 becomes a surface
in 3D k space. To understand the use of such E–k contours or surfaces, consider that
an E–k contour (or a surface) is made of many finely separated individual points,
each representing a possible electron wavefunction ψk with a possible energy E. At
absolute zero, all the energies up to the Fermi energy are taken by the valence electrons. In k space, the energy surface, corresponding to the Fermi energy is termed
the Fermi surface. The shape of this Fermi surface provides a means of interpreting
the electrical and magnetic properties of solids.
For example, Na has one 3s electron per atom. In the solid, the 3s band is half full.
The electrons take energies up to EF, which corresponds to a nearly spherical Fermi
surface within the first Brillouin zone, as indicated in Figure 4.66a. We can then say

that all the valence electrons (or nearly all) in this alkali solid exhibit an E = (ħk)2∕2me
type of behavior, as if they were free. When an external force is applied, such as an
electric or magnetic field, we can treat the electron behavior as if it were free inside
the metal with a constant mass, that is, some effective mass m*e. This is a desirable
simplification for studying such metals. We can illustrate this desirability with an
example. The Hall coefficient RH derived in Chapter 2 was based on treating the
electron as if it were a free particle inside the metal, or
RH = −

1
en

[4.85]

For Na, the experimental value of RH is −2.50 × 10−10 m3 C−1. Using the density
(0.97 g cm−3) and atomic mass (23) of Na and one valence electron per atom, we
can calculate n = 2.54 × 1028 m−3 and RH = −2.46 × 10−10 m3 C−1, which is very
close to the experimental value.
In the case of Cu, Ag, and Au (the IB metals in the Periodic Table), the Fermi
surface is inside the first Brillouin zone, but it is not spherical as depicted in Figure 4.66b. Also, it touches the centers of the zone boundaries. Some of those electrons near the zone boundary behave quite differently than E = (ħk)2∕2me, although
the majority of the electrons in the sphere do exhibit this type of behavior. To an
extent, we can expect the free electron derivations to hold. The experimental value
of RH for Cu is −0.55 × 10−10 m3 C−1, whereas the expected value, based on Equation 4.85 with one electron per atom, is −0.73 × 10−10 m3 C−1, which is noticeably
greater in magnitude than the experimental value.
The divalent metals Be, Mg, and Ca have closed outer s subshells and should
have a full s band in the solid. Recall that electrons in a full band cannot respond
to an applied field and drift. We also know that there should be an overlap between
the s and p bands, forming one partially filled continuous energy band, so these
metals are indeed conductors. In terms of Brillouin zones, their structure is based
on Figure 4.63a, which has the second zone overlapping the first Brillouin zone.
The Fermi surface extends into the second zone and the corners of the first zone

DEFINING TERMS

are empty, as depicted in Figure 4.66c. Since there are empty energy levels next
to the Fermi surface, the electrons can gain energy and drift in response to an
applied field. But the surface is not spherical; indeed, near the corners of the first
zone, it even has the wrong curvature. Therefore, it is no longer possible to describe
these electrons on the Fermi surface as obeying E = (ħk)2∕2me. When a magnetic
field is applied to a drifting electron to bend its trajectory, its total behavior is
different than that expected when it is acting as a free particle. The external force
changes the momentum ħk and the corresponding change in the energy depends
on the Fermi surface and can be quite complicated. To finish the example on the
Hall coefficient, we note that based on two valence electrons per atom (Group IIA),
the Hall coefficient for Be should be −0.25 × 10−10 m3 C−1, but the measured
value is a positive coefficient of +2.44 × 10−10 m3 C−1. Equation 4.85 is therefore
useless. It seems that the electrons moving at the Fermi surface of Be are equivalent to the motion of positive charges (like holes), so the Hall effect registers a
positive coefficient.
The Fermi surface of a semiconductor is simply the boundary of the first Brillouin zone, because there is an energy gap between the first and the second Brillouin
zones, as depicted in Figure 4.63b. In a semiconductor, all the energy levels up to
the energy gap are taken up by the valence electrons. The first Brillouin zone forms
the valence band and the second forms the conduction band.

DEFINING TERMS
Average energy Eav of an electron in a metal is determined by the Fermi–Dirac statistics and the density of
states. It increases with the Fermi energy and also with
the temperature.
Boltzmann statistics describes the behavior of a collection of particles (e.g., gas atoms) in terms of their
energy distribution. It specifies the number of particles
N(E) with given energy, through N(E) ∝ exp(−E∕kT),
where k is the Boltzmann constant. The description is
nonquantum mechanical in that there is no restriction
on the number of particles that can have the same state
(the same wavefunction) with an energy E. Also, it applies when there are only a few particles compared to
the number of possible states, so the likelihood of two
particles having the same state becomes negligible.
This is generally the case for thermally excited electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor, where
there are many more states than electrons. The kinetic
energy distribution of gas molecules in a tank obeys
the Boltzmann statistics.

Cathode is a negative electrode. It emits electrons or
attracts positive charges, that is, cations.
Debye frequency is the maximum frequency of lattice
vibrations that can exist in a particular crystal. It is the
cut-off frequency for lattice vibrations.
Debye temperature is a characteristic temperature of
a particular crystal above which nearly all the atoms
are vibrating in accordance with the kinetic molecular
theory, that is, each atom has an average energy (potential + kinetic) of 3kT due to atomic vibrations, and the
heat capacity is determined by the Dulong–Petit rule.
Density of states g(E) is the number of electron states
[e.g., wavefunctions, ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms)] per unit energy
per unit volume. Thus, g(E) dE is the number of states
in the energy range E to (E + dE) per unit volume.
Density of vibrational states is the number of lattice
vibrational modes per unit angular frequency range.
Dispersion relation relates the angular frequency ω
and the wavevector K of a wave. In a crystal lattice, the

398

CHAPTER 4

∙

MODERN THEORY OF SOLIDS

coupling of atomic oscillations leads to a particular relationship between ω and K which determines the allowed lattice waves and their group velocities. The
dispersion relation is specific to the crystal structure,
that is, it depends on the lattice, basis, and bonding.
Effective electron mass m*e represents the inertial resistance of an electron inside a crystal against an acceleration imposed by an external force, such as the
applied electric field. If Fext = eEx is the external applied force due to the applied field Ex, then the effective
mass m*e determines the acceleration a of the electron
by eEx = m*e a. This takes into account the effect of the
internal fields on the motion of the electron. In vacuum
where there are no internal fields, m*e is the mass in
vacuum me.
Electron affinity is the energy needed to remove an
electron from the conduction band of a semiconductor
to the vacuum.
Fermi–Dirac statistics determines the probability of
an electron occupying a state at an energy level E. This
takes into account that a collection of electrons must
obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The Fermi–Dirac
function quantifies this probability via f (E) = 1∕{1 +
exp[(E − EF)∕kT]}, where EF is the Fermi energy.
Fermi energy is the maximum energy of the electrons
in a metal at 0 K.
Field emission is the tunneling of an electron from the
surface of a metal into vacuum, due to the application
of a strong electric field (typically E > 109 V m−1).
Group velocity is the velocity at which traveling
waves carry energy. If ω is the angular frequency and
K is the wavevector of a wave, then the group velocity
vg = dω∕dK.
Harmonic oscillator is an oscillating system, for example, two masses joined by a spring, that can be described by simple harmonic motion. In quantum
mechanics, the energy of a harmonic oscillator is quantized and can only increase or decrease by a discrete
amount ħω. The minimum energy of a harmonic oscillator is not zero but 12ħω (see zero-point energy).
Lattice wave is a wave in a crystal due to coupled oscillations of the atoms. Lattice waves may be traveling
or stationary waves.

Linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) is a
method for obtaining the electron wavefunction in the
molecule from a linear combination of individual
atomic wavefunctions. For example, when two H atoms A and B come together, the electron wavefunctions, based on LCAO, are
ψa = ψ1s(A) + ψ1s(B)
ψb = ψ1s(A) − ψ1s(B)
where ψ1s(A) and ψ1s(B) are atomic wavefunctions
centered around the H atoms A and B, respectively.
The ψa and ψb represent molecular orbital wavefunctions for the electron; they reflect the behavior of
the electron, or its probability distribution, in the
molecule.
Mode or state of lattice vibration is a distinct, independent way in which a crystal lattice can vibrate with
its own particular frequency ω and wavevector K.
There are only a finite number of vibrational modes in
a crystal.
Molecular orbital wavefunction, or simply molecular orbital, is a wavefunction for an electron within a
system of two or more nuclei (e.g., molecule). A molecular orbital determines the probability distribution
of the electron within the molecule, just as the atomic
orbital determines the electron’s probability distribution within the atom. A molecular orbital can take two
electrons with opposite spins.
Orbital is a region of space in an atom or molecule
where an electron with a given energy may be found.
An orbit, which is a well-defined path for an electron,
cannot be used to describe the whereabouts of the electron in an atom or molecule because the electron has a
probability distribution. Orbitals are generally represented by a surface within which the total probability is
high, for example, 90 percent.
Orbital wavefunction, or simply orbital, describes
the spatial dependence of the electron. The orbital is
ψ(r, θ, ϕ), which depends on n, ℓ, and mℓ, and the spin
dependence ms is excluded.
Phonon is a quantum of lattice vibrational energy of
magnitude ħω, where ω is the vibrational angular frequency. A phonon has a momentum ħK where K is the
wavevector of the lattice wave.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Photoemission is the emission of an electron from the
surface of a metal or a semiconductor due to the absorption of an incident photon.
Secondary emission is the emission of an electron
from the surface of a metal or a semiconductor when
the surface is bombarded by a projectile (energetic)
electron. The bombarding electron and the emitted
electron are called the primary electron and the secondary electron, respectively.
Seebeck effect is the development of a built-in potential difference across a material as a result of a temperature gradient. If dV is the built-in potential across a
temperature difference dT, then the Seebeck coefficient S is defined as S = dV∕dT. The coefficient gauges
the magnitude of the Seebeck effect. Only the net Seebeck voltage difference between different metals can
be measured. The principle of the thermocouple is
based on the Seebeck effect.
State is a possible wavefunction for the electron that
defines its spatial (orbital) and spin properties, for

399

example, ψ (n, ℓ, mℓ, ms) is a state of the electron. From
the Schrödinger equation, each state corresponds to a
certain electron energy E. We thus speak of a state with
energy E, state of energy E, or even an energy state.
Generally there may be more than one state ψ with the
same energy E.
Thermionic emission is the emission of electrons
from the surface of a heated metal.
Work function is the minimum energy needed to free
an electron from the metal at a temperature of absolute
zero. It is the energy separation of the Fermi level from
the vacuum level.
Zero-point energy is the minimum energy of a harmonic oscillator 12 ħω. Even at 0 K, an oscillator in
quantum mechanics will have a finite amount of energy
which is its zero-point energy. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle does not allow a harmonic oscillator to
have zero energy because that would mean no uncertainty in the momentum and consequently an infinite
uncertainty in space (Δpx Δx > ħ).

c. What is meant by two wavefunctions Ψls(A) and Ψls(B) that are out of phase?
d. Sketch schematically the two wavefunctions Ψls(A) and Ψls(B) at one instant.

4.2

Molecular orbitals and atomic orbitals Consider a linear chain of four identical atoms representing a hypothetical molecule. Suppose that each atomic wavefunction is a 1s wavefunction. This system
of identical atoms has a center of symmetry O with respect to the center of the molecule (midway
between the second and the third atom), and all molecular wavefunctions must be either symmetric
or antisymmetric about O.
a. Using the LCAO principle, sketch the possible molecular orbitals.
b. Sketch the probability distributions ∣ψ∣2.
c. If more nodes in the wavefunction lead to greater energies, order the energies of the molecular
orbitals.
Note: The electron wavefunctions, and the related probability distributions, in a simple potential
energy well that are shown in Figure 3.16 can be used as a rough guide toward finding the appropriate molecular wavefunctions in the four-atom symmetric molecule. For example, if we were to smooth
the electron potential energy in the four-atom molecule into a constant potential energy, that is,
generate a potential energy well, we should be able to modify or distort, without flipping, the molecular orbitals to somewhat resemble ψ1 to ψ4 sketched in Figure 3.16. Consider also that the number
of nodes increases from none for ψ1 to three for ψ4 in Figure 3.16.

Work function of metals and crystal planes The work function of a metal Φ represents the energy
needed to eject and electron from the Fermi level to the vacuum level. However, this energy depends
on the surface of the crystal involved on extracting the electron. Φ depends on the crystal plane from
which the electron is ejected. Surface conditions such as a thin oxide layer or contaminants on the
surface would obviously modify the observed Φ. Measurements of Φ are therefore done under high
vacuum condition on clean crystal surfaces. Table 4.6 lists measured Φ for single crystal and polycrystalline samples of Al, Au, and Ag that have a cubic crystal structure (FCC). Φ has been obtained for
three different planes in the case of single crystals. (a) What are the average Φav and mean standard
deviation of the work function for the three planes for each crystal? (b) What is the percentage difference
between the Φ for the polycrystalline sample and Φav? (c) In (a), your averaging gave equal weighting
to each plane, Φav = (Φ001 + Φ011 + Φ111)∕3. How would you modify the averaging process to represent the different percentages of crystal planes that appear on the surface of a polycrystalline sample?

4.4

Electronegativity and the work function of metals The electronegativity of an atom represents its
relative ability to attract the electrons in a bond it forms with another atom. The ionization energy
EI of a neutral atom is the energy needed to remove an electron from the atom. Electron affinity EA is
the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom, which becomes an anion. Table 4.7
lists EI and EA for Group IA, IB, and IIA metals. The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is
defined as χM = 12 (EI + EA ) , which is in eV. Higher values of χM indicate a stronger ability to attract
electrons. It has been argued that a metal whose atoms have a higher electronegativity should also
have a higher work function Φ. Table 4.7 lists EI and EA for metal atoms in groups IA, IB, and IIA,
and also lists Φ for the metal itself. (IIB is excluded as there are no reliable EA values, and their
anions are not stable.) Plot χM versus Φ. What is your conclusion? What would be an empirical
relationship for all three groups?

Secondary electron emission and photomultiplier tubes Consider a photomultiplier tube as shown
in Figure 4.20. When an electron emitted from a photocathode, it is accelerated and it strikes a dynode.
The primary electron enters the dynode material and ejects an electron by a process called secondary

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
electron emission as shown in Figure 4.21b. If δ is the secondary electron emission yield, then after
N dynodes the overall gain G = δN. δ increases with the kinetic energy Ep of the incident primary
electron. The more energetic is the incident primary electron, the more it can ionize the medium and
release secondary electrons. Thus, in general δ ≈ AE αp, where Ep is the energy of the primary electron,
and A and α are constants. There is however a limit and δ eventually saturates and then decreases
with Ep. At very high energies, the primary electron penetrates too far into the solid and the secondary electrons are not able to reach the surface to escape. A suitable voltage divider circuit provides
a voltage difference V between successive dynodes so that the energy of the primary electron upon
impact with the dynode is eV. A particular photomultiplier tube has GaP:Cs coated on the dynodes.
R&D team has measured δ for GaP:Cs and has found that δ = 3.7 when V = 100 V. How many
dynodes are needed to achieve a gain of 105 at V = 100 V? Suppose that the effective distance from
one dynode to the next (the electron path) is roughly 10 mm. What is the transit time from one dynode
to the next and the shortest response time of the tube with gain 105?

The number of particles in dE is then P(E)g(E)dE. Take g(E) ∝ E1∕2 and find the average particle
energy. Experiments carried out on measuring the velocity distribution among gas atoms in a tank shows
that the average kinetic energy of an atom is (3∕2)kT. What should β be? What is your conclusion?

Fermi energy in Mg The density and atomic mass of Mg are 1.74 g cm−3, and 24.31 g mol−1. Mg
is in Group II in the Periodic Table. Calculate the Fermi energy of the electrons in Mg in eV to two
decimal places. When a Mg target is bombarded by electrons in a vacuum tube, soft X-ray are emitted whose spectra are shown in Table 4.10 in two rows at a time as photon energy hf (eV) and relative
intensity I, where the maximum value of I has been assigned 100. Plot I versus hf. Plot also I∕f 3
versus hf, but with maximum I∕f 3 set to 100. What is your conclusion? The reason for dividing I by
f 3 is that the emitted X-ray intensity is proportional to two factors: (a) the concentration of electrons
nE at E that can fall down to the vacated L-shell, and (b) a quantum mechanical transition probability
that depends on (hf )3.

Temperature measurements with a thermocouple An engineer with limited resources wants to
measure the temperature (T1) of a furnace. He grabs an aluminum and a copper wire, makes a junction and inserts the junction into the furnace as in Figure 4.67a, and simply connects the other end
to the terminals of a digital voltmeter. He reads a voltage of 1.320 mV with the copper side positive.
He knows that the room temperature (T2) is usually between 20 °C and 25 °C and the DVM has an
accuracy of ±0.005 mV. He has been given Table 4.3. What is the furnace temperature (T1)? Later, he
comes across some ice, makes an ice-water bath and uses another copper wire to generate a second junction as in Figure 4.67b. He inserts this junction into the ice-water bath (0 °C). The voltmeter now registers
1.401 mV. What is the furnace temperature? Why did he decide to use an ice-water as a reference? What

Field-assisted emission in MOS devices Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors in microelectronics have a metal gate on an SiO2 insulating layer on the surface of a doped Si crystal. Consider
this as a parallel plate capacitor. Suppose the gate is an Al electrode of area 50 μm × 50 μm and has
a voltage of 10 V with respect to the Si crystal. Consider two thicknesses for the SiO2, (a) 100 Å
and (b) 40 Å, where (1 Å = 10−10 m). The work function of Al is 4.2 eV, but this refers to electron
emission into vacuum, whereas in this case, the electron is emitted into the oxide. The potential energy
barrier ΦB between Al and SiO2 is about 3.1 eV, and the field-emission current density is given by
Equation 4.48a and b. Calculate the field-emission current for the two cases. For simplicity, take me
to be the electron mass in free space. What is your conclusion?

4.31

CNTs and field emission The electric field at the tip of a sharp emitter is much greater than the
“applied field,” Eo. The applied field is simply defined as VG∕d where d is the distance from the
cathode tip to the gate or the grid; it represents the average nearly uniform field that would exist if
the tip were replaced by a flat surface so that the cathode and the gate would almost constitute a
parallel plate capacitor. The tip experiences an effective field E that is much greater than Eo, which
is expressed by a field enhancement factor β that depends on the geometry of the cathode–gate
3∕2
emitter, and the shape of the emitter; E = βEo. Further, we can take Φ 1∕2
in Equation 4.48.

c. GaAs has a thermal conductivity of 200 W m−1 K−1 at 100 K and 80 W m−1 K−1 at 200 K.
Calculate its thermal conductivity at 25 °C and compare with the experimental value of
44 W m−1 K−1. (Hint: Take κ ∝ T−n in the temperature region of interest; see Figure 4.56.)

4.36

High temperature thermal conductivity At sufficiently high temperatures, we can assume both Cv
and vph are temperature independent. κ is then proportional to ℓph due to phonon–phonon collisions.
The probability of phonon–phonon collisions increases with the phonon concentration nph, which is
proportional to T. Thus, ℓph ∝ 1∕nph ∝ 1∕T, or κ ∝ 1∕T. Except at low temperatures, for many semiconductors, κ is taken empirically as κ = AT −n where A and n are constants. Table 4.15 shows
thermal conductivity data for a Ge crystal between 50 K and 800 K over which κ follows a κ = AT −n
type of behavior. Find A and n.

Overlapping bands at EF and higher resistivity Figure 4.68 shows the density of states for Cu

d bands. The d band is narrow compared with the s band, and the electron’s effective mass in this d
band is large; for simplicity, we will assume m*e is “infinite” in this band. Consequently, the d-band
electrons cannot be accelerated by the field (infinite m*
e ), have a negligible drift mobility, and make
no contribution to the conductivity. Electrons in the s band can become scattered by phonons into the
d band, and hence become relatively immobile until they are scattered back into the s band when they
can drift again. Consider Ni and one particular conduction electron at EF starting in the s band. Sketch

Further EF is close to the top of the 3d band shown as ED in Figure 4.68. The states in the range EF

CHAPTER

5
Semiconductors
In this chapter we develop a basic understanding of the properties of intrinsic and

extrinsic semiconductors. Although most of our discussions and examples will be
based on Si, the ideas are applicable to Ge and to the compound semiconductors
such as GaAs, InP, and others. By intrinsic Si we mean an ideal perfect crystal of
Si that has no impurities or crystal defects such as dislocations and grain boundaries.
The crystal thus consists of Si atoms perfectly bonded to each other in the diamond
structure. At temperatures above absolute zero, we know that the Si atoms in the
crystal lattice will be vibrating with a distribution of energies. Even though the average energy of the vibrations is at most 3kT and incapable of breaking the Si–Si bond,
a few of the lattice vibrations in certain crystal regions may nonetheless be sufficiently energetic to “rupture” a Si–Si bond. When a Si–Si bond is broken, a “free”
electron is created that can wander around the crystal and also contribute to electrical conduction in the presence of an applied field. The broken bond has a missing
electron that causes this region to be positively charged. The vacancy left behind by
the missing electron in the bonding orbital is called a hole. An electron in a neighboring bond can readily tunnel into this broken bond and fill it, thereby effectively
causing the hole to be displaced to the original position of the tunneling electron.
By electron tunneling from a neighboring bond, holes are therefore also free to
wander around the crystal and also contribute to electrical conduction in the presence
of an applied field. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of thermally generated
electrons is equal to the number of holes (broken bonds). In an extrinsic semiconductor, impurities are added to the semiconductor that can contribute either excess electrons or excess holes. For example, when an impurity such as arsenic is added to Si,
each As atom acts as a donor and contributes a free electron to the crystal. Since
these electrons do not come from broken bonds, the numbers of electrons and holes
are not equal in an extrinsic semiconductor, and the As-doped Si in this example
will have excess electrons. It will be an n-type Si since electrical conduction will be
mainly due to the motion of electrons. It is also possible to obtain a p-type Si crystal
in which hole concentration is in excess of the electron concentration due to, for
example, boron doping.

5.1.1 SILICON CRYSTAL AND ENERGY BAND DIAGRAM
The electronic configuration of an isolated Si atom is [Ne]3s2p2. However, in the
vicinity of other atoms, the 3s and 3p energy levels are so close that the interactions
result in the four orbitals ψ (3s), ψ (3px), ψ (3py), and ψ (3pz) mixing together to form
four new hybrid orbitals (called ψ hyb) that are symmetrically directed as far away
from each other as possible (toward the corners of a tetrahedron). In two dimensions,
we can simply view the orbitals pictorially as in Figure 5.1a. The four hybrid orbitals, ψhyb, each have one electron so that they are half-occupied. Therefore, a ψhyb
orbital of one Si atom can overlap a ψhyb orbital of a neighboring Si atom to form
a covalent bond with two spin-paired electrons. In this manner one Si atom bonds
with four other Si atoms by overlapping the half-occupied ψhyb orbitals, as illustrated
in Figure 5.1b. Each Si–Si bond corresponds to a bonding orbital, ψB, obtained by
overlapping two neighboring ψhyb orbitals. Each bonding orbital (ψB) has two spinpaired electrons and is therefore full. Neighboring Si atoms can also form covalent
bonds with other Si atoms, thus forming a three-dimensional network of Si atoms.
The resulting structure is the Si crystal in which each Si atom bonds with four Si
ψhyb orbitals

atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. The crystal structure is that of a diamond, which
was described in Chapter 1. We can imagine the Si crystal in two dimensions as
depicted in Figure 5.1b. The electrons in the covalent bonds are the valence electrons.
The energy band diagram of the silicon crystal is shown in Figure 5.1c.1 The
vertical axis is the electron energy in the crystal. The valence band (VB) contains
those electronic states that correspond to the overlap of bonding orbitals (ψB). Since
all the bonding orbitals (ψB) are full with valence electrons in the crystal, the VB is
also full with these valence electrons at a temperature of absolute zero. The conduction band (CB) contains electronic states that are at higher energies, those corresponding to the overlap of antibonding orbitals. The CB is separated from the VB
by an energy gap Eg, called the bandgap. The energy level Ev marks the top of the
VB and Ec marks the bottom of the CB. The energy distance from Ec to the vacuum
level, the width of the CB, is called the electron affinity χ. The general energy band
diagram in Figure 5.1c applies to all crystalline semiconductors with appropriate
changes in the energies.
The electrons shown in the VB in Figure 5.1c are those in the covalent bonds
between the Si atoms in Figure 5.1b. An electron in the VB, however, is not localized to an atomic site but extends throughout the whole solid. Although the electrons
appear localized in Figure 5.1b, at the bonding orbitals between the Si atoms this is
not, in fact, true. In the crystal, the electrons can tunnel from one bond to another
and exchange places. If we were to work out the wavefunction of a valence electron
in the Si crystal, we would find that it extends throughout the whole solid. This
means that the electrons in the covalent bonds are indistinguishable. We cannot label
an electron from the start and say that the electron is in the covalent bond between
these two atoms.
We can crudely represent the silicon crystal in two dimensions as shown in
Figure 5.2. Each covalent bond between Si atoms is represented by two lines corresponding to two spin-paired electrons. Each line represents a valence electron.

5.1.2 ELECTRONS AND HOLES

an applied electric field because there are plenty of neighboring empty energy levels.
An electron in the CB can easily gain energy from the field and move to higher
energy levels because these states are empty. Generally we can treat an electron in
the CB as if it were free within the crystal with certain modifications to its mass,
as explained later in Section 5.1.3.
Since the only empty states are in the CB, the excitation of an electron from the
VB requires a minimum energy of Eg. Figure 5.3a shows what happens when a
photon of energy hf > Eg is incident on an electron in the VB. This electron absorbs
the incident photon and gains sufficient energy to surmount the energy gap Eg and
reach the CB. Consequently, a free electron and a “hole,” corresponding to a missing
electron in the VB, are created. In some semiconductors such as Si and Ge, the
photon absorption process also involves lattice vibrations (vibrations of the Si atoms),
which we have not shown in Figure 5.3b.
Although in this specific example a photon of energy hf > Eg creates an electron–
hole pair, this is not necessary. In fact, in the absence of radiation, there is an electron–
hole generation process going on in the sample as a result of thermal generation.
Due to thermal energy, the atoms in the crystal are constantly vibrating, which corresponds to the bonds between the Si atoms being periodically deformed. In a certain
region, the atoms, at some instant, may be moving in such a way that a bond becomes
overstretched, as pictorially depicted in Figure 5.4. This will result in the overstretched bond rupturing and hence releasing an electron into the CB (the electron
effectively becomes “free”). The empty electronic state of the missing electron in
the bond is what we call a hole in the valence band. The free electron, which is in
the CB, can wander around the crystal and contribute to the electrical conduction
when an electric field is applied. The region remaining around the hole in the VB
is positively charged because a charge of −e has been removed from an otherwise

neutral region of the crystal. This hole, denoted as h+, can also wander around the
crystal as if it were free. This is because an electron in a neighboring bond can “jump,”
that is, tunnel, into the hole to fill the vacant electronic state at this site and thereby
create a hole at its original position. This is effectively equivalent to the hole being
displaced in the opposite direction, as illustrated in Figure 5.5a. This single step can
reoccur, causing the hole to be further displaced. As a result, the hole moves around
the crystal as if it were a free positively charged entity, as pictured in Figure 5.5a

to d. Its motion is quite independent from that of the original electron. When an
electric field is applied, the hole will drift in the direction of the field and hence
contribute to electrical conduction. It is now apparent that there are essentially two
types of charge carriers in semiconductors: electrons and holes. A hole is effectively
an empty electronic state in the VB that behaves as if it were a positively charged
“particle” free to respond to an applied electric field.
When a wandering electron in the CB meets a hole in the VB, the electron has
found an empty state of lower energy and therefore occupies the hole. The electron
falls from the CB to the VB to fill the hole, as depicted in Figure 5.5e and f. This
is called recombination and results in the annihilation of an electron in the CB and
a hole in the VB. The excess energy of the electron falling from CB to VB in certain
semiconductors such as GaAs and InP is emitted as a photon. In Si and Ge the excess
energy is lost as lattice vibrations (heat).
It must be emphasized that the illustrations in Figure 5.5 are pedagogical pictorial
visualizations of hole motion based on classical notions and cannot be taken too seriously, as discussed in more advanced texts (see also Section 5.13). We should remember that the electron has a wavefunction in the crystal that is extended and not localized,
as the pictures in Figure 5.5 imply. Further, the hole is a concept that corresponds to
an empty valence band wavefunction that normally has an electron. Again, we cannot
localize the hole to a particular site, as the pictures in Figure 5.5 imply.

5.1.3 CONDUCTION IN SEMICONDUCTORS
When an electric field is applied across a semiconductor as shown in Figure 5.6, the
energy bands bend. The total electron energy E is KE + PE, but now there is an

additional electrostatic PE contribution that is not constant in an applied electric
field. A uniform electric field Ex implies a linearly decreasing potential V(x), by
virtue of (dV∕dx) = −Ex, that is, V = −Ax + B. This means that the PE, −eV(x), of
the electron is now eAx − eB, which increases linearly across the sample. All the
energy levels and hence the energy bands must therefore tilt up in the x direction,
as shown in Figure 5.6, in the presence of an applied field.
Under the action of Ex, the electron in the CB moves to the left and immediately
starts gaining energy from the field. When the electron collides with a thermal vibration of a Si atom, it loses some of this energy and thus “falls” down in energy in
the CB. After the collision, the electron starts to accelerate again, until the next
collision, and so on. We recognize this process as the drift of the electron in an
applied field, as illustrated in Figure 5.6. The drift velocity vde of the electron is μeEx
where μe is the drift mobility of the electron. In a similar fashion, the holes in the
VB also drift in an applied field, but here the drift is along the field. Notice that
when a hole gains energy, it moves “down” in the VB because the potential energy
of the hole is of opposite sign to that of the electron.
Since both electrons and holes contribute to electrical conduction, we may write
the current density J, from its definition, as
J = envde + epvdh

[5.1]

where n is the electron concentration in the CB, p is the hole concentration in the
VB, and vde and vdh are the drift velocities of electrons and holes in response to an
applied electric field Ex. Thus,
vde = μeEx

and

vdh = μhEx

[5.2]

where μe and μh are the electron and hole drift mobilities. In Chapter 2, we derived
the drift mobility μe of the electrons in a conductor as
μe =

eτe
me

[5.3]

where τe is the mean free time between scattering events and me is the electronic
mass. The ideas on electron motion in metals can also be applied to the electron
motion in the CB of a semiconductor to rederive Equation 5.3. We must, however,
use an effective mass m*e for the electron in the crystal rather than the mass me in
free space. A “free” electron in a crystal is not entirely free because as it moves it
interacts with the potential energy (PE) of the ions in the solid and therefore experiences various internal forces. The effective mass m*e accounts for these internal
forces in such a way that we can relate the acceleration a of the electron in the CB
to an external force Fext (e.g., −eEx) by Fext = m*e a just as we do for the electron in
vacuum by Fext = mea. In applying the Fext = m*e a type of description to the motion
of the electron, we are assuming, of course, that the effective mass of the electron
can be calculated or measured experimentally. It is important to remark that the true
behavior is governed by the solution of the Schrödinger equation in a periodic lattice
(crystal) from which it can be shown that we can indeed describe the inertial resistance
of the electron to acceleration in terms of an effective mass m*e . The effective mass
depends on the interaction of the electron with its environment within the crystal.

We can now speculate on whether the hole can also have a mass. As long as we
view mass as resistance to acceleration, that is, inertia, there is no reason why the
hole should not have a mass. Accelerating the hole means accelerating electrons
tunneling from bond to bond in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is apparent that
the hole will have a nonzero finite inertial mass because otherwise the smallest
external force will impart an infinite acceleration to it. If we represent the effective
mass of the hole in the VB by m*h , then the hole drift mobility will be
μh =

[5.4]

where τh is the mean free time between scattering events for holes.
Taking Equation 5.1 for the current density further, we can write the conductivity
of a semiconductor as
σ = enμe + epμh

[5.5]

where n and p are the electron and hole concentrations in the CB and VB, respectively. This is a general equation valid for all semiconductors.

5.1.4

ELECTRON AND HOLE CONCENTRATIONS

The general equation for the conductivity of a semiconductor, Equation 5.5, depends
on n the electron concentration, and p, the hole concentration. How do we determine
these quantities? We follow the procedure schematically shown in Figure 5.7a to d
in which the density of states is multiplied by the probability of a state being occupied and integrated over the entire CB for n and over the entire VB for p.
We define gcb(E ) as the density of states in the CB, that is, the number of states
per unit energy per unit volume. The probability of finding an electron in a state
with energy E is given by the Fermi–Dirac function f (E ), which is discussed in
Chapter 4. Then gcb(E )f(E ) is the actual number of electrons per unit energy per
unit volume nE(E ) in the CB. Thus,
nE dE = gcb(E) f (E)dE

is the number of electrons in the energy range E to E + dE. Integrating this from
the bottom (Ec) to the top of the CB gives the electron concentration n, number of
electrons per unit volume, in the CB. In other words,
n=

We will assume that (Ec − FF) ≫ kT (i.e., EF is at least a few kT below Ec)
so that
f (E) ≈ exp[−(E − EF)∕kT]

We are thus replacing Fermi–Dirac statistics by Boltzmann statistics and thereby
inherently assuming that the number of electrons in the CB is far less than the number of states in this band.

Further, we will take the upper limit to be E = ∞ since f (E ) decays rapidly with
energy so that gcb(E)f(E) → 0 near the top of the band. Furthermore, since gcb(E)f(E)
is significant only close to Ec, we can use

of the Fermi energy, and is called the effective density of states at the CB edge.
Notice that Nc depends on the effective mass2 and has a small temperature dependence as apparent from Equation 5.7. Equation 5.6 can be interpreted as follows. If
we take all the states in the conduction band and replace them with an effective
concentration Nc (number of states per unit volume) at Ec and then multiply this
simply by the Boltzmann probability function, f (Ec) = exp[−(Ec − EF)∕kT ], we
obtain the concentration of electrons at Ec, that is, in the conduction band. Nc is thus
an effective density of states at the CB band edge.
We can carry out a similar analysis for the concentration of holes in the VB.
Multiplying the density of states gvb(E) in the VB with the probability of occupancy
by a hole [1 − f (E)], that is, the probability that an electron is absent, gives pE,
the hole concentration per unit energy. Integrating this over the VB gives the hole

We can now see the virtues of studying the density of states g(E) as a function
of energy E and the Fermi–Dirac function f(E). Both were central factors in deriving the expressions for n and p. There are no specific assumptions in our derivations,
except for EF being a few kT away from the band edges, which means that Equations
5.6 and 5.8 are generally valid.
The general equations that determine the free electron and hole concentrations
are thus given by Equations 5.6 and 5.8. It is interesting to consider the product np,

where Eg = Ec − Ev is the bandgap energy. First, we note that this is a general
expression in which the right-hand side, Nc Nv exp(−Eg∕kT ), behaves as if it were
a constant for a given material at a given temperature; it depends on the bandgap
Eg but not on the position of the Fermi level. In the special case of an intrinsic

that Nc Nv exp(−Eg∕kT ) must be n2i. From Equation 5.10 we therefore have

This is a general equation that is valid as long as we have thermal equilibrium.
External excitation, such as photogeneration, is excluded. It states that the product
np is constant at a given temperature and depends only on the semiconductor material. Equation 5.11a is called the mass action law. If we somehow increase the
electron concentration, then we inevitably reduce the hole concentration. The constant ni has a special significance because it represents the free electron and hole
concentrations in the intrinsic material. From Equation 5.11a,
ni = (Nc Nv ) 1∕2 exp(−

2kT )
Eg

[5.11b]

An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor crystal in which the electron and hole concentrations are equal. By pure we mean virtually no impurities in
the crystal. We should also exclude crystal defects that may capture carriers of one
sign and thus result in unequal electron and hole concentrations. Clearly in a pure
semiconductor, electrons and holes are generated in pairs by thermal excitation
across the bandgap. It must be emphasized that Equation 5.11b is generally valid
and therefore applies to both intrinsic and nonintrinsic (n ≠ p) semiconductors.
When an electron and hole meet in the crystal, they “recombine.” The electron
falls in energy and occupies the empty electronic state that the hole represents.
Consequently, the broken bond is “repaired,” but we lose two free charge carriers.
Recombination of an electron and hole results in their annihilation. In a semiconductor we therefore have thermal generation of electron–hole pairs by thermal excitation from the VB to the CB, and we also have recombination of electron–hole pairs
that removes them from their conduction and valence bands, respectively. The rate
of recombination R will be proportional to the number of electrons and also to the
number of holes. Thus
R ∝ np

The rate of generation G will depend on how many electrons are available for
excitation at Ev, that is, Nv; how many empty states are available at Ec, that is, Nc; and
the probability that the electron will make the transition, that is, exp(−Eg∕kT), so that
G ∝ Nc Nv exp(−

kT )
Eg

Since in thermal equilibrium we have no continuous increase in n or p, we must
have the rate of generation equal to the rate of recombination, that is, G = R. This
is equivalent to Equation 5.11a.
In sketching the diagrams in Figure 5.7a to d to illustrate the derivation of the
expressions for n and p (in Equations 5.6 and 5.8), we assumed that the Fermi level EF
is somewhere around the middle of the energy bandgap. This was not an assumption

in the mathematical derivations but only in the sketches. From Equations 5.6 and
5.8, we also note that the position of Fermi level is important in determining the
electron and hole concentrations. It serves as a “mathematical crank” to determine
n and p.
We first consider an intrinsic semiconductor, n = p = ni. Setting p = ni in Equation 5.8, we can solve for the Fermi energy in the intrinsic semiconductor, EFi, that is,

It is apparent from these equations that if Nc = Nv or m*e = m*h , then

that is, EFi is right in the middle of the energy gap. Normally, however, the effective
masses will not be equal and the Fermi level will be slightly shifted down from
midgap by an amount 34 kT ln(m*e∕m*h ), which is quite small compared with 12 Eg . For
Si and Ge, the hole effective mass (for density of states) is slightly smaller than the
electron effective mass, so EFi is slightly below the midgap.
The condition np = n2i means that if we can somehow increase the electron
concentration in the CB over the intrinsic value—for example, by adding impurities
into the Si crystal that donate additional electrons to the CB—we will then have
n > p. The semiconductor is then called n-type. The Fermi level must be closer to
Ec than Ev, so that
Ec − EF < EF − Ev

and Equations 5.6 and 5.8 yield n > p. The np product always yields n2i in thermal
equilibrium in the absence of external excitation, for example, illumination.
It is also possible to have an excess of holes in the VB over electrons in the CB,
for example, by adding impurities that remove electrons from the VB and thereby
generate holes. In that case EF is closer to Ev than to Ec. A semiconductor in which
p > n is called a p-type semiconductor. The general band diagrams with the appropriate Fermi levels for intrinsic, n-type, and p-type semiconductors (e.g., i-Si, n-Si,
and p-Si, respectively) are illustrated in Figure 5.8a to c.
It is apparent that if we know where EF is, then we have effectively determined
n and p by virtue of Equations 5.6 and 5.8. We can view EF as a material property
that is related to the concentration of charge carriers that contribute to electrical
conduction. Its significance, however, goes beyond n and p. It also determines the

energy needed to remove an electron from the semiconductor. The energy difference
between the vacuum level (where the electron is free) and EF is the work function
Φ of the semiconductor, the energy required to remove an electron even though there
are no electrons at EF in a semiconductor.
The Fermi level can also be interpreted in terms of the potential energy per
electron for electrical work similar to the interpretation of electrostatic PE. Just as
eΔV is the electrical work involved in taking a charge e across a potential difference
ΔV, any difference in EF in going from one end of a material (or system) to another
is available to do an amount ΔEF of external work. A corollary to this is that if
electrical work is done on the material, for example, by passing a current through
it, then the Fermi level is not uniform in the material. ΔEF then represents the work
done per electron. For a material in thermal equilibrium and not subject to any
external excitation such as illumination or connections to a voltage supply, the Fermi
level in the material must therefore be uniform, ΔEF = 0.
What is the average energy of an electron in the conduction band of a semiconductor? Also, what is the mean speed of an electron in the conduction band? We
note that the concentration of electrons with energies E to E + dE is nE(E) dE or
gcb(E)f (E) dE. Thus the average energy of electrons in the CB, by definition of the
mean, is
ECB =

where the integration must be over the CB. Substituting the proper expressions for
gcb(E) and f(E) in the integrand and carrying out the integration from Ec to the top
of the band, we find the very simple result that
ECB = Ec +

2

[5.14]

Thus, an electron in the conduction band has an average energy of 32 kT above Ec.
Since we know that an electron at Ec is “free” in the crystal, 32 kT must be its average
kinetic energy.

NOTE: Ge and Si are indirect whereas InP and GaAs are direct bandgap semiconductors. Effective mass related to conductivity
(labeled a) is different than that for density of states (labeled b). In numerous textbooks, ni is taken as 1.45 × 1010 cm−3 and is therefore
the most widely used value of ni for Si, though the correct value is actually 1.0 × 1010 cm−3. (Green, M.A., Journal of Applied Physics, 67,
2944, 1990.) (Data combined from various sources.)

This is just like the average kinetic energy of gas atoms (such as He atoms) in
a tank assuming that the atoms (or the “particles”) do not interact, that is, they are
independent. We know from the kinetic theory that the statistics of a collection of
independent gas atoms obeys the classical Maxwell–Boltzmann description with an
average energy given by 32 kT . We should also recall that the description of electron
statistics in a metal involves the Fermi–Dirac function, which is based on the Pauli
exclusion principle. In a metal the average energy of the conduction electron is 35 EF
and, for all practical purposes, temperature independent. We see that the collective
electron behavior is completely different in the two solids. We can explain the difference by noting that the conduction band in a semiconductor is only scarcely
populated by electrons, which means that there are many more electronic states than
electrons and thus the likelihood of two electrons trying to occupy the same electronic state is practically nil. We can then neglect the Pauli exclusion principle and
use the Boltzmann statistics. This is not the case for metals where the number of
conduction electrons and the number of states are comparable in magnitude.
Table 5.1 compares some of the properties of the important semiconductors, Ge,
Si, InP, and GaAs.
EXAMPLE 5.1

INTRINSIC CONCENTRATION AND CONDUCTIVITY OF Si Given that the density of
states related effective masses of electrons and holes in Si are approximately 1.08me and
0.60me, respectively, and the electron and hole drift mobilities at room temperature are 1400
and 450 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, calculate the intrinsic concentration and intrinsic resistivity

Although we calculated ni = 1.0 × 1010 cm−3, the most widely used ni value in the literature
has been 1.45 × 1010 cm−3. The difference arises from a number of factors but, most importantly, from what exact value of the effective hole mass should be used in calculating Nv.
Henceforth we will simply use3 ni = 1.0 × 1010 cm−3, which seems to be the “true” value.
MEAN SPEED OF ELECTRONS IN THE CB Estimate the mean speed of electrons in the
conduction band of Si at 300 K. If a is the magnitude of lattice vibrations, then the kinetic
theory predicts a2 ∝ T; or stated differently, the mean energy associated with lattice vibrations
(proportional to a2) increases with kT. Given the temperature dependence of the mean speed
of electrons in the CB, what should be the temperature dependence of the drift mobility? The
effective mass of an electron in the conduction band is 0.26me.
SOLUTION

Suppose that vth is the root mean square velocity of the electron in the CB, then the average
KE, 12 m*e v 2th, of this electron from Equation 5.14 is 32 kT . Thus,

EXAMPLE 5.2

426

CHAPTER 5

∙

SEMICONDUCTORS

The above velocity vth is called the thermal velocity, and it is roughly the same as the
mean speed of the electron in the CB. (See Example 1.11.)
The mean free time τ of the electron between scattering events due to thermal vibrations
of the atoms is inversely proportional to both the mean speed vth of the electron and the scattering cross section of the thermal vibrations, that is,
τ ∝

1
vth (πa2 )

where a is the amplitude of the atomic thermal vibrations. But, vth ∝ T1∕2 and (πa2) ∝ kT, so
that τ ∝ T −3∕2 and consequently μe ∝ T −3∕2.
Experimentally μe is not exactly proportional to T −3∕2 but to T −2.4, a higher power index.
The effective mass used in the density of states calculations is actually different than that
used in transport calculations such as the mean speed, drift mobility, and so on.
EXAMPLE 5.3

MEAN FREE PATH OF ELECTRONS IN THE CB Consider the motion of electrons in the
CB of an undoped GaAs crystal. What is the mean free path of an average electron in the
conduction band? How does this compare with the mean free path of a conduction electron
in copper which has a drift mobility of 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a mean free path of 40 nm. What
is your conclusion?
SOLUTION

The drift mobility of electrons in a semiconductor is controlled by various scattering mechanisms that limit the mean scattering time or the free time of an electron in the CB. If τ is the
mean scattering time for electrons in the CB, then, from Chapter 2, drift mobility μe = eτ∕m*e ,
where m*e is the effective mass of the electron in the crystal. Thus,
τ=

(1.602 × 10−19 C)

We know from Example 5.1 that the mean velocity or the thermal velocity vth of electrons in
the CB is approximately 2.3 × 105 m s−1. The mean free path ℓ = vthτ = (2.3 × 105 m s−1)
(2.1 × 10−13 s) = 48 × 10−9 m or 48 nm. The conduction electrons in copper have significantly
lower drift mobility but their mean free path is almost the same as a conduction electron in
Si. Recall from Chapter 4 that conduction electrons in a metal follow Fermi–Dirac statistics
and their mean speed is very much larger than the thermal velocity of electrons in Si.

5.2

EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTORS

By introducing small amounts of impurities into an otherwise pure Si crystal, it is
possible to obtain a semiconductor in which the concentration of carriers of one
polarity is much in excess of the other type. Such semiconductors are referred to as
extrinsic semiconductors vis-à-vis the intrinsic case of a pure and perfect crystal.
For example, by adding pentavalent impurities, such as arsenic, which have a valency
of more than four, we can obtain a semiconductor in which the electron concentration is much larger than the hole concentration. In this case we will have an n-type
semiconductor. If we add trivalent impurities, such as boron, which have a valency
of less than four, then we find that we have an excess of holes over electrons. We
now have a p-type semiconductor. How do impurities change the concentrations of
holes and electrons in a semiconductor?

5.2

EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTORS

427

5.2.1 n-TYPE DOPING
Consider what happens when small amounts of a pentavalent (valency of 5) element
from Group V in the Periodic Table, such as As, P, Sb, are introduced into a pure
Si crystal. We only add small amounts (e.g., one impurity atom for every million
host atoms) because we wish to surround each impurity atom by millions of Si atoms,
thereby forcing the impurity atoms to bond with Si atoms in the same diamond
crystal structure. Arsenic has five valence electrons, whereas Si has four. Thus when
an As atom bonds with four Si atoms, it has one electron left unbonded. It cannot
find a bond to go into, so it is left orbiting around the As atom, as illustrated in
Figure 5.9. The As+ ionic center with an electron e− orbiting it is just like a hydrogen atom in a silicon environment. We can easily calculate how much energy is
required to free this electron away from the As site, thereby ionizing the As impurity.
Had this been a hydrogen atom in free space, the energy required to remove the
electron from its ground state (at n = 1) to far away from the positive center would
have been given by −En with n = 1. The binding energy of the electron in the H
atom is thus
Eb = −E1 =

mee4
8ε2oh2

= 13.6 eV

If we wish to apply this to the electron around an As+ core in the Si crystal
environment, we must use εr εo instead of εo, where εr is the relative permittivity of
silicon, and also the effective mass of the electron m*e in the silicon crystal. Thus,
the binding energy of the electron to the As+ site in the Si crystal is

With εr = 11.9 and m*e ≈ 13 me for silicon, we find EbSi = 0.032 eV, which is
comparable with the average thermal energy of atomic vibrations at room temperature,
∼3kT (∼0.07 eV). Thus, the fifth valence electron can be readily freed by thermal
vibrations of the Si lattice. The electron will then be “free” in the semiconductor,
Figure 5.9 Arsenic-doped Si crystal.
The four valence electrons of As allow it to bond just
like Si, but the fifth electron is left orbiting the As site.
The energy required to release the free fifth electron
into the CB is very small.

or, in other words, it will be in the CB. The energy required to excite the electron
to the CB is therefore 0.032 eV. The addition of As atoms introduces localized
electronic states at the As sites because the fifth electron has a localized wavefunction,
of the hydrogenic type, around As+. The energy Ed of these states is 0.032 eV below
Ec because this is how much energy is required to take the electron away into the
CB. Thermal excitation by the lattice vibrations at room temperature is sufficient to
ionize the As atom, that is, excite the electron from Ed into the CB. This process
creates free electrons but immobile As+ ions, as shown in the energy band diagram
of an n-type semiconductor in Figure 5.10. Because the As atom donates an electron
into the CB, it is called a donor atom. Ed is the electron energy around the donor
atom. Ed is close to Ec, so the spare fifth electron from the dopant can be readily
donated to the CB. If Nd is the donor atom concentration in the crystal, then provided
that Nd ≫ ni, at room temperature the electron concentration in the CB will be nearly
equal to Nd, that is n ≈ Nd. The hole concentration will be p = n2i∕Nd, which is less
than the intrinsic concentration because a few of the large number of electrons in
the CB recombine with holes in the VB so as to maintain np = n2i. The conductivity
will then be

At low temperatures, however, not all the donors will be ionized and we need
to know the probability, denoted as fd (Ed), of finding an electron in a state with
energy Ed at a donor. This probability function is similar to the Fermi–Dirac function
f (Ed) except that it has a factor of 12 multiplying the exponential term,

5.2.2 p-TYPE DOPING
We saw that introducing a pentavalent atom into a Si crystal results in n-type doping
because the fifth electron cannot go into a bond and escapes from the donor into the
CB by thermal excitation. By similar arguments, we should anticipate that doping a
Si crystal with a trivalent atom (valency of 3) such as B, Al, Ga, or In will result
in a p-type Si crystal. We consider doping Si with small amounts of B as shown in
Figure 5.11a. Because B has only three valence electrons, when it shares them with
four neighboring Si atoms, one of the bonds has a missing electron, which of course
is a hole. A nearby electron can tunnel into this hole and displace the hole further
away from the boron atom. As the hole moves away, it gets attracted by the negative
charge left behind on the boron atom and therefore takes an orbit around the B− ion,
as shown in Figure 5.11b. The binding energy of this hole to the B− ion can be
calculated using the hydrogenic atom analogy as in the n-type Si case. This binding
energy turns out to be very small, ∼0.05 eV, so at room temperature the thermal
vibrations of the lattice can free the hole away from the B− site. A free hole, we

B has only three valence electrons. When it substitutes for a Si atom, one of its
bonds has an electron missing and therefore a hole, as shown in (a). The hole orbits
around the B− site by the tunneling of electrons from neighboring bonds, as shown
in (b). Eventually, thermally vibrating Si atoms provide enough energy to free the
hole from the B− site into the VB, as shown.

recall, exists in the VB. The escape of the hole from the B− site involves the B atom
accepting an electron from a neighboring Si–Si bond (from the VB), which effectively
results in the hole being displaced away and its eventual escape to freedom in the VB.
The B atom introduced into the Si crystal therefore acts as an electron acceptor and,
because of this, it is called an acceptor impurity. The electron accepted by the B atom
comes from a nearby bond. On the energy band diagram, an electron leaves the VB
and gets accepted by a B atom, which becomes negatively charged. This process leaves
a hole in the VB that is free to wander away, as illustrated in Figure 5.12.
It is apparent that doping a silicon crystal with a trivalent impurity results in a
p-type material. We have many more holes than electrons for electrical conduction
since the negatively charged B atoms are immobile and hence cannot contribute to
the conductivity. If the concentration of acceptor impurities Na in the crystal is much
greater than the intrinsic concentration ni, then at room temperature all the acceptors
would have been ionized and thus p ≈ Na. The electron concentration is then determined by the mass action law, n = n2i∕Na, which is much smaller than p, and consequently the conductivity is simply given by σ = eNaμh.
Typical ionization energies for donor and acceptor atoms in the silicon crystal
are summarized in Table 5.2.

5.2.3 COMPENSATION DOPING
What happens when a semiconductor contains both donors and acceptors? Compensation doping is a term used to describe the doping of a semiconductor with both

5.2

EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTORS

431

donors and acceptors to control the properties. For example, a p-type semiconductor
doped with Na acceptors can be converted to an n-type semiconductor by simply
adding donors until the concentration Nd exceeds Na. The effect of donors compensates for the effect of acceptors and vice versa. The electron concentration is then
given by Nd − Na provided the latter is larger than ni. When both acceptors and
donors are present, what essentially happens is that electrons from donors recombine
with the holes from the acceptors so that the mass action law np = n2i is obeyed.
Remember that we cannot simultaneously increase the electron and hole concentrations because that leads to an increase in the recombination rate that returns the
electron and hole concentrations to satisfy np = n2i. When an acceptor atom accepts
a valence band electron, a hole is created in the VB. This hole then recombines with
an electron from the CB. Suppose that we have more donors than acceptors. If we
take the initial electron concentration as n = Nd, then the recombination between
the electrons from the donors and Na holes generated by Na acceptors results in the
electron concentration reduced by Na to n = Nd − Na. By a similar argument, if we
have more acceptors than donors, the hole concentration becomes p = Na − Nd, with
electrons from Nd donors recombining with holes from Na acceptors. Thus there are
two compensation effects:
1. More donors:

Nd − Na ≫ ni

2. More acceptors: Na − Nd ≫ ni

These arguments assume that the temperature is sufficiently high for donors and

temperatures, we have to consider donor and acceptor statistics and the charge neutrality of the whole crystal, as in Example 5.9.

that is, 1 part per billion (ppb) (note that this doping corresponds to one foreigner living in

μe = 1400 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh = 450 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Notice the drastic fall in the resistance when the crystal is doped with only 1 in 109 atoms.

means that Na = 5 × 1013 cm−3, which results in a conductivity of
σ = epμh = (1.6 × 10−19 C)(5 × 1013 cm−3)(450 cm2 V−1 s−1)

SOLUTION

This semiconductor has been compensation doped with excess acceptors over donors, so
Na − Nd = 1017 − 1016 = 9 × 1016 cm−3

This is much larger than the intrinsic concentration ni = 1.0 × 1010 cm−3 at room temperature, so

Clearly, the electron concentration and hence its contribution to electrical conduction is
completely negligible compared with the hole concentration. Thus, by excessive boron doping,
the n-type semiconductor has been converted to a p-type semiconductor.

SOLUTION

Sb gives n-type doping with Nd = 1016 cm−3, and since Nd ≫ ni (=1.0 × 1010 cm−3), we have
n = Nd = 1016 cm−3

ENERGY BAND DIAGRAM OF AN n-TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR CONNECTED TO A VOLTAGE
SUPPLY Consider the energy band diagram for an n-type semiconductor that is connected

to a voltage supply of V and is carrying a current. The applied voltage drops uniformly along
the semiconductor, so the electrons in the semiconductor now also have an imposed electrostatic potential energy that decreases toward the positive terminal, as depicted in Figure 5.13.
The whole band structure, the CB and the VB, therefore tilts. When an electron drifts from
A toward B, its PE decreases because it is approaching the positive terminal. The Fermi level
EF is above that for the intrinsic case, EFi.
We should remember that an important property of the Fermi level is that a change in
EF within a system is available externally to do electrical work. As a corollary we note that
when electrical work is done on the system, for example, when a battery is connected to a
semiconductor, then EF is not uniform throughout the whole system. A change in EF within

a system ΔEF is equivalent to electrical work per electron or eV. EF therefore follows the
electrostatic PE behavior, and the change in EF from one end to the other, EF (A) − EF (B), is
just eV, the energy expended in taking an electron through the semiconductor, as shown in
Figure 5.13. Electron concentration in the semiconductor is uniform, so Ec − EF must be
constant from one end to the other. Thus the CB, VB, and EF all bend by the same amount.

5.3

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF CONDUCTIVITY

So far we have been calculating conductivities and resistivities of doped semiconductors at room temperature by simply assuming that n ≈ Nd for n-type and p ≈ Na for
p-type doping, with the proviso that the concentration of dopants is much greater
than the intrinsic concentration ni. To obtain the conductivity at other temperatures
we have to consider two factors: the temperature dependence of the carrier concentration and the drift mobility.

5.3.1 CARRIER CONCENTRATION TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE
Consider an n-type semiconductor doped with Nd donors per unit volume where
Nd ≫ ni. We take the semiconductor down to very low temperatures until its conductivity is practically nil. At this temperature, the donors will not be ionized because
the thermal vibrational energy is insufficiently small. As the temperature is increased,
some of the donors become ionized and donate their electrons to the CB, as shown
in Figure 5.14a. The Si–Si bond breaking, that is, thermal excitation from Ev to Ec,
is unlikely because it takes too much energy. Since the donor ionization energy
ΔE = Ec − Ed is very small (≪Eg), thermal generation involves exciting electrons from
Ed to Ec. The electron concentration at low temperatures is given by the expression

similar to the intrinsic case, that is,
n = (Nc Nv ) 1∕2 exp(−

2kT )
Eg

[5.20]

Equation 5.20 is valid when thermal generation occurs across the bandgap Eg
from Ev to Ec. Equation 5.19 is the counterpart of Equation 5.20 taking into account
that at low temperatures the excitation is from Ed to Ec (across ΔΕ) and that instead
of Nv, we have Nd as the number of available electrons. The numerical factor 12 in
Equation 5.19 arises because donor occupation statistics is different by this factor
from the usual Fermi–Dirac function, as mentioned earlier.
As the temperature is increased further, eventually all the donors become ionized
and the electron concentration is equal to the donor concentration, that is, n = Nd,
as depicted in Figure 5.14b. This state of affairs remains unchanged until very high
temperatures are reached, when thermal generation across the bandgap begins to
dominate. At very high temperatures, thermal vibrations of the atoms will be so
strong that many Si–Si bonds will be broken and thermal generation across Eg will
dominate. The electron concentration in the CB will then be mainly due to thermal
excitation from the VB to the CB, as illustrated in Figure 5.14c. But this process
also generates an equal concentration of holes in the VB. Accordingly, the semiconductor behaves as if it were intrinsic. The electron concentration at these temperatures will therefore be equal to the intrinsic concentration ni, which is given by
Equation 5.20.
The dependence of the electron concentration on temperature thus has three
regions:
1. Low-temperature range (T < Ts). The increase in temperature at these low
temperatures ionizes more and more donors. The donor ionization continues until
we reach a temperature Ts, called the saturation temperature, when all donors have
been ionized and we have saturation in the concentration of ionized donors. The
electron concentration is given by Equation 5.19. This temperature range is often
referred to as the ionization range.
2. Medium-temperature range (Ts < T < Ti). Since nearly all the donors
have been ionized in this range, n = Nd. This condition remains unchanged until
T = Ti, when ni, which is temperature dependent, becomes equal to Nd. It is this
temperature range Ts < T < Ti that utilizes the n-type doping properties of the semiconductor in pn junction device applications. This temperature range is often referred
to as the extrinsic range.
3. High-temperature range (T > Ti). The concentration of electrons generated
by thermal excitation across the bandgap ni is now much larger than Nd, so the
electron concentration n = ni(T ). Furthermore, as excitation occurs from the VB to
the CB, the hole concentration p = n. This temperature range is referred to as the
intrinsic range.
Figure 5.15 shows the behavior of the electron concentration with temperature in
an n-type semiconductor. By convention we plot ln(n) versus the reciprocal temperature T −1. At low temperatures, ln(n) versus T −1 is almost a straight line with a slope

a measure of the bandgap energy Eg. The log(ni) versus 1∕T graphs can be used to
find, for example, whether the dopant concentration at a given temperature is more
than the intrinsic concentration. As we will find out in Chapter 6, the reverse saturation current in a pn junction diode depends on n2i, so Figure 5.16 also indicates how
this saturation current varies with temperature.

SOLUTION

Remember that ni(T ) is highly temperature dependent, as shown in Figure 5.16 so that as T
increases, eventually at T ≈ Ti, ni becomes comparable to Nd. Beyond Ti, ni(T > Ti) ≫ Nd.
Thus we need to solve
ni(Ti) = Nd = 1015 cm−3

From the log(ni) versus 103∕T graph for Si in Figure 5.16, when ni = 1015 cm−3, (103∕Ti) ≈ 1.85,
giving Ti ≈ 541 K or 268 °C.
We will assume that most of the donors are ionized, say at T ≈ Ts, where the extrinsic
and the extrapolated ionization lines intersect in Figure 5.15:

This is the temperature at which the ionization behavior intersects the extrinsic region. In the

Nc (Ts ) = Nc (300 K) (

Ts 3∕2

Clearly, then, the equation can only be solved numerically. Similar equations occur in a wide
range of physical problems where one term has the strongest temperature dependence. Here,
exp(−ΔΕ∕kTs) has the strongest temperature dependence. First assume Nc is that at 300 K,
Nc = 2.8 × 1019 cm−3, and evaluate Ts,

With this new Nc at a lower temperature, the improved Ts is 74.6 K. Since we only need
an estimate of Ts, the extrinsic range of this semiconductor is therefore from about 75 K to
541 K or −198 °C to about 268 °C.

This is a quadratic equation in n. Solving this equation gives

Clearly, this equation should give the behavior of n as a function of T and Nd when we
also consider the statistics in Equation 4. In the low-temperature region (T < Ts), n2i is negligible in the expression for n and we have

5.3.2 DRIFT MOBILITY: TEMPERATURE AND IMPURITY DEPENDENCE
The temperature dependence of the drift mobility follows two distinctly different
temperature variations. In the high-temperature region, it is observed that the drift
mobility is limited by scattering from lattice vibrations. As the magnitude of atomic
vibrations increases with temperature, the drift mobility decreases in the fashion
μ ∝ T −3∕2. However, at low temperatures the lattice vibrations are not sufficiently
strong to be the major limitation to the mobility of the electrons. It is observed that
at low temperatures the scattering of electrons by ionized impurities is the major
mobility limiting mechanism and μ ∝ T 3∕2, as we will show below.
We recall from Chapter 2 that the electron drift mobility μ depends on the mean
free time τ between scattering events via

where S is the cross-sectional area of the scatterer; vth is the mean speed of the
electrons, called the thermal velocity; and Ns is the number of scatterers per unit
volume. If a is the amplitude of the atomic vibrations about the equilibrium, then
S = πa2. As the temperature increases, so does the amplitude a of the lattice vibrations following a2 ∝ T behavior, as shown in Chapter 2. An electron in the CB is
free to wander around and therefore has only KE. We also know that the mean kinetic
energy per electron in the CB is 32 kT , just as if the kinetic molecular theory could
be applied to all those electrons in the CB. Therefore,

which leads to a lattice vibration scattering limited mobility, denoted as μL, of
the form

[5.23]

At low temperatures, scattering of electrons by thermal vibrations of the lattice
will not be as strong as the electron scattering brought about by ionized donor impurities. As an electron passes by an ionized donor As+, it is attracted and thus deflected

The present arguments are totally classical whereas in terms of modern physics, the electrons are scattered
by phonons and the phonon concentration increases with temperature. An analogy may help. The light intensity
classically depends on E2 whereas in quantum physics it is given by the photon flux density.

from its straight path, as schematically shown in Figure 5.17. This type of scattering
of an electron is what limits the drift mobility at low temperatures.
The PE of an electron at a distance r from an As+ ion is due to the Coulombic
attraction, and its magnitude is given by
∣PE∣ =

4πεoεrr

If the KE of the electron approaching an As+ ion is larger than its PE at distance
r from As+, then the electron will essentially continue without feeling the PE and
therefore without being deflected, and we can say that it has not been scattered.
Effectively, due to its high KE, the electron does not feel the Coulombic pull of the
donor. On the other hand, if the KE of the electron is less than its PE at r from As+,
then the PE of the Coulombic interaction will be so strong that the electron will be
strongly deflected. This is illustrated in Figure 5.17. The critical radius rc corresponds to the case when the electron is just scattered, which is when KE ≈ ∣PE(rc)∣.
But the average KE = 32 kT , so at r = rc

Note also that μI decreases with increasing ionized dopant concentration NI,
which itself may be temperature dependent. Indeed, at the lowest temperatures, below
the saturation temperature Ts, NI will be strongly temperature dependent because not
all the donors would have been fully ionized.
The overall temperature dependence of the drift mobility is then, simply, the
reciprocal additions of the μI and μL by virtue of Matthiessen’s rule, that is,

so the scattering process having the lowest mobility determines the overall (effective)
drift mobility.
The experimental temperature dependence of the electron drift mobility in
both Ge and Si is shown in Figure 5.18 as a log–log plot for various donor concentrations. The slope on this plot corresponds to the index n in μe ∝ T n. The
simple theoretical sketches in the insets show how μL and μI from Equations 5.23
and 5.24 depend on the temperature. For Ge, at low doping concentrations (e.g.,
Nd = 1013 cm−3), the experiments indicate a μe ∝ Τ −1.5 type of behavior, which
is in agreement with μe determined by μL in Equation 5.23. Curves for Si at lowlevel doping ( μI negligible) at high temperatures, however, exhibit a μe ∝ Τ −2.3
type of behavior rather than Τ −1.5, which can be accounted for in a more rigorous
theory. As the donor concentration increases, the drift mobility decreases by virtue of μI getting smaller. At the highest doping concentrations and at low temperatures, the electron drift mobility in Si exhibits almost a μe ∝ Τ 3∕2 type of
behavior. Similar arguments can be extended to the temperature dependence of
the hole drift mobility.
The dependences of the room temperature electron and hole drift mobilities on
the dopant concentration for Si are shown in Figure 5.19 where, as expected, past a
certain amount of impurity addition, the drift mobility is overwhelmingly controlled
by μI in Equation 5.25.

5.3.3 CONDUCTIVITY TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE
The conductivity of an extrinsic semiconductor doped with donors depends on the
electron concentration and the drift mobility, both of which have been determined
above. At the lowest temperatures in the ionization range, the electron concentration
depends exponentially on the temperature by virtue of
1∕2

n = ( Nc Nd) exp[ −

which then also dominates the temperature dependence of the conductivity. In the
intrinsic range at the highest temperatures, the conductivity is dominated by the
temperature dependence of ni since
σ = eni( μe + μh)

and ni is an exponential function of temperature in contrast to μ ∝ T −3∕2. In the
extrinsic temperature range, n = Nd and is constant, so the conductivity follows
the temperature dependence of the drift mobility. Figure 5.20 shows schematically

of the drift mobility.

EXAMPLE 5.10

COMPENSATION-DOPED Si

a.
b.

A Si sample has been doped with 1017 arsenic atoms cm−3. Calculate the conductivity
of the sample at 27 °C (300 K) and at 127 °C (400 K).
The above n-type Si sample is further doped with 9 × 1016 boron atoms cm−3. Calculate
the conductivity of the sample at 27 °C and 127 °C.

SOLUTION

a.

The arsenic dopant concentration, Nd = 1017 cm−3, is much larger than the intrinsic
concentration ni, which means that n = Nd and p = (n2i ∕Nd) ≪ n and can be neglected.
Thus n = 1017 cm−3 and the electron drift mobility at Nd = 1017 cm−3 is approximately 700 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the drift mobility versus dopant concentration graph in
Figure 5.19, so
σ = enμe + epμh = eNd μe
= (1.6 × 10−19 C)(1017 cm−3)(700 cm2 V−1 s−1) = 11.2 Ω−1 cm−1

At T = 127 °C = 400 K from the μe vs. T graph in Figure 5.18,
μe ≈ 450 cm2 V−1 s−1

Thus,
σ = eNd μe = 7.20 Ω−1 cm−1

b.

With further doping we have Na = 9 × 1016 cm−3, so from the compensation effect
Nd − Na = 1 × 1017 − 9 × 1016 = 1016 cm−3

Since Nd − Na ≫ ni, we still have an n-type material with n = Nd − Na = 1016 cm−3.
But the drift mobility now is about ∼600 cm2 V−1 s−1 because, even though Nd − Na is
now 1016 cm−3 and not 1017 cm−3, all the donors and acceptors are still ionized and hence
still scatter the charge carriers. The recombination of electrons from the donors and holes
from the acceptors does not alter the fact that at room temperature all the dopants will
be ionized. Effectively, the compensation effect is as if all electrons from the donors
were being accepted by the acceptors. Although with compensation doping the net electron concentration is n = Nd − Na, the drift mobility scattering is determined by (Nd + Na),
which in this case is 1017 + 9 × 1016 cm−3 = 1.9 × 1017 cm−3, which gives an electron
drift mobility of ∼600 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K (Figure 5.19) and ∼400 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 400 K
(Figure 5.18). Then, neglecting the hole concentration p = n2i ∕(Nd − Na), we have
At 300 K,

σ = e(Nd − Na)μe ≈ (1.6 × 10−19 C)(1016 cm−3)(600 cm2 V−1 s−1)
= 0.96 Ω−1 cm−1

At 400 K,

σ = e(Nd − Na)μe ≈ (1.6 × 10−19 C)(1016 cm−3)(400 cm2 V−1 s−1)
= 0.64 Ω−1 cm−1

5.3

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF CONDUCTIVITY

COMPENSATION DOPING IN Si Consider a p-type Si crystal that has been doped uniformly
with B with a concentration of 1015 cm−3. We wish to convert this to an n-Si with a conductivity 20 Ω−1 cm−1 within 10 percent. What is the donor concentration we need?
SOLUTION

The starting p-Si has Na = 1015 cm−3 which means that, Figure 5.19, μe ≈ 1350 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Upon compensation doping, we would have n-Si in which the electron concentration n = Nd − Na
and the conductivity is
σ = enμe = e(Nd − Na)μe = 20 Ω−1 cm−1

We know Na, and if μe was independent of doping, we could readily solve this for Nd. However, as shown in Figure 5.19, μe depends on the ionized dopant concentration, Nd + Na. We
start by first using μe = 1350 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the starting crystal so that
σ = (1.60 × 10−19)(Nd − 1015 cm−3)(1350 cm2 V−1 s−1) = 20 Ω−1 cm−1

which we can solve and find Nd = 9.36 × 1016 cm−3. This is almost two order of magnitude
larger than Na so we may as well neglect Na in the conductivity equation. The ionized
dopant concentration, Nd + Na is also approximately Nd and at this Nd, from Figure 5.19,
μe′ ≈ 750 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, the actual conductivity σ′ is (750∕1350)σ or 11.1 Ω−1 cm−1,
roughly half of what we need. We can improve our calculation by using the new mobility μe′.
So we can now write σ with this new mobility μ′e as
σ = eNd μ′e = 1.60 × 10−19 × Nd × 750 cm2 V−1 s−1 = 20 Ω−1 cm−1

and solving this we find Nd = 1.7 × 1017 cm−3. From Figure 5.19, at Nd = 1.7 × 1017 cm−3,
μe″ ≈ 600 cm2 V−1 s−1. The actual conductivity σ″ is (600∕750)σ or 16 Ω−1 cm−1. Obviously,
we are getting closer to 20 Ω−1 cm−1. The next iteration will have
σ = eNd μ″e = 1.60 × 10−19 × Nd × 600 cm2 V−1 s−1 = 20 Ω−1 cm−1

which upon solving gives Nd = 2.1 × 1017 cm−3. At this donor concentration the mobility
μe″′ ≈ 550 cm2 which yields a conductivity of 18.5 Ω−1 cm−1, within 10 percent of our target 20 Ω−1 cm−1.
Clearly in σ = eNdμe, the drift mobility μe depends on Nd as in Figure 5.19, so the solution for Nd above took a tedious number of iterative calculations and look-ups in Figure 5.19.
We can always represent the μe versus Nd curve with an empirical equation μe(Nd) and then
solve σ = eNd μe(Nd) numerically; an approach taken in Question 5.7.

5.3.4 DEGENERATE AND NONDEGENERATE SEMICONDUCTORS
The general exponential expression for the concentration of electron in the CB,
n ≈ Nc exp[ −

(Ec − EF )
]
kT

[5.26]

is based on replacing Fermi–Dirac statistics with Boltzmann statistics, which is only
valid when Ec is several kT above EF. In other words, we assumed that the number
of states in the CB far exceeds the number of electrons there, so the likelihood of
two electrons trying to occupy the same state is almost nil. This means that the Pauli
exclusion principle can be neglected and the electron statistics can be described by

445

EXAMPLE 5.11

446

CHAPTER 5

SEMICONDUCTORS

the Boltzmann statistics. Nc is a measure of the density of states in the CB. The
Boltzmann expression for n is valid only when n ≪ Nc. Those semiconductors for
which n ≪ Nc and p ≪ Nv are termed nondegenerate semiconductors. They essentially follow all the discussions above and exhibit all the normal semiconductor
properties outlined above.
When the semiconductor has been excessively doped with donors, then n may
be so large, typically 1019–1020 cm−3, that it may be comparable to or greater than
Nc. In that case the Pauli exclusion principle becomes important in the electron
statistics and we have to use the Fermi–Dirac statistics. Equation 5.26 for n is then
no longer valid. Such a semiconductor exhibits properties that are more metal-like
than semiconductor-like; for example, the resistivity follows ρ ∝ Τ. Semiconductors
that have n > Nc or p > Nv are called degenerate semiconductors.
The large carrier concentration in a degenerate semiconductor is due to its heavy
doping. For example, as the donor concentration in an n-type semiconductor is
increased, at sufficiently high doping levels, the donor atoms become so close to
each other that their orbitals overlap to form a narrow energy band that overlaps and
becomes part of the conduction band. Ec is therefore slightly shifted down and Eg
becomes slightly narrower. The valence electrons from the donors fill the band from
Ec. This situation is reminiscent of the valence electrons filling overlapping energy
bands in a metal. In a degenerate n-type semiconductor, the Fermi level is therefore
within the CB, or above Ec just like EF is within the band in a metal. The majority
of the states between Ec and EF are full of electrons as indicated in Figure 5.21. In
the case of a p-type degenerate semiconductor, the Fermi level lies in the VB below
Ev. It should be emphasized that one cannot simply assume that n = Nd or p = Na
in a degenerate semiconductor because the dopant concentration is so large that they
interact with each other. Not all dopants are able to become ionized, and the carrier
concentration eventually reaches a saturation typically around ∼1020 cm−3. Furthermore, the mass action law np = n2i is not valid for degenerate semiconductors.
Degenerate semiconductors have many important uses. For example, they are
used in laser diodes, zener diodes, and ohmic contacts in ICs, and as metal gates in
many microelectronic MOS devices.

DIRECT AND INDIRECT RECOMBINATION

DEGENERATE n-TYPE Si Consider a degenerate n-type Si crystal in which the donor concentration (e.g., P) is 1020 cm−3 (or 1026 m−3). Where is the Fermi level with respect to the
bottom (Ec) of the CB, that is EFn − Ec? What is your conclusion?

447

EXAMPLE 5.12

SOLUTION

Clearly, Nd > Nc, and if we attempt to use Equation 5.6, that is we assume Boltzman statistics,
then
ΔEFn = EFn − Ec = kT ln(Nd∕Nc) = (0.02585 eV)ln[(1020)∕(2.8 × 1019)] = 0.033 eV

Remember that Boltzman statistics inherent in Equation 5.6 does not obey the Pauli exclusion
principle; no two electrons can be in the same state (same wavefunction, including spin).
When EFn is within the CB, electrons need follow the Pauli exclusion principle and look for
higher energy states to avoid sharing the same state. So, we expect EFn to be greater than
0.033 eV. The electron concentration in the CB is given by the integration of the product of
density of states gcb(E) and the Fermi–Dirac function f (E),

This is the same procedure we used in the case of metals in Chapter 4 to relate the Fermi

Notice that we used the effective mass m*e related to the density of states. While, as expected,
this is larger than that from Boltzman statistics, it is still not correct because it is at 0 K. At
a finite temperature T, we argued that for metals EFm(0) ≫ kT and the Fermi energy from
the above integration approximates to Equation 4.23

or 65 meV above Ec. We can, of course, find EFn by trial and error until the above integration
generates n = Nd. The final result is very close to 65 meV.6 It is clear that the description of
degenerate semiconductors follows the same concepts we used in the case of metals.

5.4

DIRECT AND INDIRECT RECOMBINATION

Above absolute zero of temperature, the thermal excitation of electrons from the VB
to the CB continuously generates free electron–hole pairs. It should be apparent that
in equilibrium there should be some annihilation mechanism that returns the electron
from the CB down to an empty state (a hole) in the VB. When a free electron,
wandering around in the CB of a crystal, “meets” a hole, it falls into this low-energy
empty electronic state and fills it. This process is called recombination. Intuitively,

The Joyce–Dixon equation that is used in advanced semiconductor textbooks allows a good approximation to
ΔEFn and gives 66 meV.

recombination corresponds to the free electron finding an incomplete bond with a
missing electron. The electron then enters and completes this bond. The free electron
in the CB and the free hole in the VB are consequently annihilated. On the energy
band diagram, the recombination process is represented by returning the electron
from the CB (where it is free) into a hole in the VB (where it is in a bond). Figure 5.22 shows a direct recombination mechanism, for example, as it occurs in GaAs,
in which a free electron recombines with a free hole when they meet at one location
in the crystal. The excess energy of the electron is lost as a photon of energy
hf = Eg. In fact, it is this type of recombination that results in the emitted light from
light emitting diodes (LEDs).
The recombination process between an electron and a hole, like every other
process in nature, must obey the momentum conservation law. The wavefunction of
an electron in the CB, ψcb, is a traveling wave with a certain wavevector kcb. The
actual electron wavefunctions are discussed later in this chapter, but for now we
simply accept the fact if we were to solve the Schrodinger equation for an electron
in a crystal in which the electron potential energy V(x) is periodic (due to a periodic
arrangement of atoms), we would find traveling wave solutions. For example, the
electron wavefunctions ψcb in the CB will be traveling waves each with an energy E
and a wavevector kcb. The quantity, ħkcb, just as in the case of a photon, can be used to
represent the momentum of the electron in the CB. In fact, in response to an external force Fext, the electron’s momentum ħkcb will change according to Fext = d(ħkcb)∕dt,
exactly as we expect a momentum to change in mechanics. The quantity ħkcb is called
the electron’s crystal momentum because it represents the momentum that we need
in describing the behavior of the electron inside the crystal in response to an external force.7 Similarly, the electron wavefunction, ψvb in the VB will have a momentum
ħkcb associated with it.
7
The rate of change of electron’s true momentum would be due to external and internal forces summed
together. However, this is not a useful approach inasmuch we would like to know the effect of external forces
on the behavior of the electron. We can account for the internal forces by using a periodic potential energy in
the Schrodinger equation, and once we have done this, ħk turns out to be a useful momentum quantity that
follows our usual experience that external force (Fext) is d(ħk)∕dt.

are so close that they form a continuous energy versus momentum behavior. (b) Energy versus crystal
momentum for an indirect bandgap semiconductor such as Si.

If we were to plot the energy E of each ψcb against ħkcb for the CB wavefunctions, we would find the E versus ħk behavior shown in Figure 5.23a. Each circle is
a wavefuncion ψcb with an energy E and wavevector kcb. The circles represent electron
states. These are normally so close to each other that they form a continuum; Figure
5.23a is highly exaggerated. Notice that E increases parabolically with ħkcb near the
bottom of the CB, as we would expect classically from E = p2∕(2m*e ), where p is
electron’s momentum. Similar arguments, of course, apply to the VB, and we can
plot E versus ħkvb as well in this case as shown in Figure 5.23a. The hole energy
increases downwards (in the opposite direction to the electron energy), so that the
hole energy near the top of the VB also shows a parabolic behavior with momentum, that is, Ehole = p2∕(2m*h ), where p the hole momentum and m*h is the hole
effective mass.
Conservation of linear momentum during recombination requires that when
the electron drops from the CB to the VB, its wavevector should remain the same,
kvb = kcb, because the momentum carried away by the photon is negligibly small.
This is indeed the case for GaAs whose E versus ħk behavior follows that shown in
Figure 5.23a. Such semiconductors are called direct bandgap semiconductors. The
top of the valence band is immediately below the bottom of the CB on the E versus
ħk diagram as in Figure 5.23a. Thus, for direct bandgap semiconductors, such as
GaAs, the states with kvb = kcb are right at the top of the valence band where there are
many empty states (i.e., holes). Consequently, an electron in the CB of GaAs can
drop down to an empty electronic state at the top of the VB and maintain kvb = kcb.
Thus, direct recombination is highly probable in GaAs and it is this very reason
that makes GaAs an LED material.

CHAPTER 5

SEMICONDUCTORS

For the elemental semiconductors, Si and Ge, the electron energy versus crystal
momentum (E vs. ħk) behavior is such that the bottom of the CB is displaced with
respect to the top of the VB in terms of ħk as shown in Figure 5.23b. Such semiconductors are called indirect bandgap semiconductors. Those states (ψvb) with
kvb = kcb are now somewhere in the middle of the VB and they are therefore fully
occupied as shown in Figure 5.23b. Consequently, there are no empty states in the
VB which can satisfy kvb = kcb and so direct recombination in Si and Ge is next
to impossible.
In elemental indirect bandgap semiconductors such as Si and Ge, electrons and
holes usually recombine through recombination centers. A recombination center
increases the probability of recombination because it can “take up” any momentum
difference between a hole and electron. The process essentially involves a third body,
which may be an impurity atom or a crystal defect. The electron is captured by the
recombination center and thus becomes localized at this site. It is “held” at the
center until some hole arrives and recombines with it. In the energy band diagram
picture shown in Figure 5.24a, the recombination center provides a localized electronic state below Ec in the bandgap, which is at a certain location in the crystal.
When an electron approaches the center, it is captured. The electron is then localized
and bound to this center and “waits” there for a hole with which it can recombine.
In this recombination process, the energy of the electron is usually lost to lattice
vibrations (as “sound”) via the “recoiling” of the third body. Emitted lattice vibrations are called phonons. A phonon is a quantum of energy associated with atomic
vibrations in the crystal analogous to the photon.
Typical recombination centers, besides the donor and acceptor impurities, might
be metallic impurities and crystal defects such as dislocations, vacancies, or interstitials. Each has its own peculiar behavior in aiding recombination, which will not be
described here.

MINORITY CARRIER LIFETIME

It is instructive to mention briefly the phenomenon of charge carrier trapping since
in many devices this can be the main limiting factor on the performance. An electron
in the conduction band can be captured by a localized state, just like a recombination
center, located in the bandgap, as shown in Figure 5.24b. The electron falls into the
trapping center at Et and becomes temporarily removed from the CB. At a later time,
due to an incident energetic lattice vibration, it becomes excited back into the CB and
is available for conduction again. Thus trapping involves the temporary removal of the
electron from the CB, whereas in the case of recombination, the electron is permanently
removed from the CB since the capture is followed by recombination with a hole. We
can view a trap as essentially being a flaw in the crystal that results in the creation
of a localized electronic state, around the flaw site, with an energy in the bandgap.
A charge carrier passing by the flaw can be captured and lose its freedom. The flaw
can be an impurity or a crystal imperfection in the same way as a recombination
center. The only difference is that when a charge carrier is captured at a recombination site, it has no possibility of escaping again because the center aids recombination.
Although Figure 5.24b illustrates an electron trap, similar arguments also apply to
hole traps, which are normally closer to Ev. In general, flaws and defects that give
localized states near the middle of the bandgap tend to act as recombination centers.

MINORITY CARRIER LIFETIME

Consider what happens when an n-type semiconductor, doped with 5 × 1016 cm−3
donors, is uniformly illuminated with appropriate wavelength light to photogenerate
electron–hole pairs (EHPs), as shown in Figure 5.25. We will now define thermal
equilibrium majority and minority carrier concentrations in an extrinsic semiconductor. In general, the subscript n or p is used to denote the type of semiconductor, and
o to refer to thermal equilibrium in the dark.
In an n-type semiconductor, electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the
minority carriers.
nno is defined as the majority carrier concentration (electron concentration
in an n-type semiconductor) in thermal equilibrium in the dark. These electrons,
constituting the majority carriers, are thermally ionized from the donors.

pno is termed the minority carrier concentration (hole concentration in an
n-type semiconductor) in thermal equilibrium in the dark. These holes that constitute the minority carriers are thermally generated across the bandgap.
In both cases the subscript no refers to an n-type semiconductor and thermal
equilibrium conditions, respectively. Thermal equilibrium means that the mass action
law is obeyed and nno pno = n2i.
When we illuminate the semiconductor, we create excess EHPs by photogeneration. Suppose that the electron and hole concentrations at any instant are denoted by
nn and pn, which are defined as the instantaneous majority (electron) and minority
(hole) concentrations, respectively. At any instant and at any location in the semiconductor, we define the departure from the equilibrium by excess concentrations
as follows:
Δnn is the excess electron (majority carrier) concentration: Δnn = nn − nno
Δpn is the excess hole (minority carrier) concentration: Δpn = pn − pno
Under illumination, at any instant, therefore
nn = nno + Δnn

and

pn = pno + Δpn

Photoexcitation creates EHPs or an equal number of electrons and holes, as
shown in Figure 5.25, which means that
Δpn = Δnn

and obviously the mass action law is not obeyed: nn pn ≠ n2i . It is worth remembering
that
dnn dΔnn
=
dt
dt

and

dpn dΔpn
=

since nno and pno depend only on temperature.
Let us assume that we have “weak” illumination, which causes, say, only a
10 percent change in nno, that is,
Δnn = 0.1nno = 0.5 × 1016 cm−3

Then
Δpn = Δnn = 0.5 × 1016 cm−3

Figure 5.26 shows a single-axis plot of the majority (nn) and minority (pn) concentrations in the dark and in light. The scale is logarithmic to allow large orders of
magnitude changes to be recorded. Under illumination, the minority carrier concentration is
pn = pno + Δpn = 2.0 × 103 + 0.5 × 1016 ≈ 0.5 × 1016 = Δpn

That is, pn ≈ Δpn, which shows that although nn changes by only 10 percent, pn
changes drastically, that is, by a factor of ∼1012.
Figure 5.27 shows a pictorial view of what is happening inside an n-type semiconductor when light is switched on at a certain time and then later switched off

again. Obviously when the light is switched off, the condition pn = Δpn (state B in
Figure 5.27) must eventually revert back to the dark case (state A) where pn = pno.
In other words, the excess minority carriers Δpn and excess majority carriers Δnn
must be removed. This removal occurs by recombination. Excess holes recombine
with the electrons available and disappear. This, however, takes time because the
electrons and holes have to find each other. In order to describe the rate of recombination, we introduce a temporal quantity, denoted by τh and called the minority
carrier lifetime (mean recombination time), which is defined as follows: τh is the
average time a hole exists in the VB from its generation to its recombination, that
is, the mean time the hole is free before recombining with an electron. An alternative
and equivalent definition is that 1∕τh is the average probability per unit time that a
hole will recombine with an electron. We must remember that the recombination
process occurs through recombination centers, so the recombination time τh will
depend on the concentration of these centers and their effectiveness in capturing the
minority carriers. Once a minority carrier has been captured by a recombination
center, there are many majority carriers available to recombine with it, so τh in an

454

indirect process is independent of the majority carrier concentration. This is the
reason for defining the recombination time as a minority carrier lifetime.
If the minority carrier recombination time is, say, 10 s, and if there are some
1000 excess holes, then it is clear that these excess holes will be disappearing at a
rate of 1000∕10 s = 100 per second. The rate of recombination of excess minority
carriers is simply Δpn∕τh. At any instant, therefore,

This is a general expression that describes the time evolution of the excess
minority carrier concentration given the photogeneration rate Gph, the minority carrier lifetime τh, and the initial condition at t = 0. The only assumption is weak
injection (Δpn < nno).
We should note that the recombination time τh depends on the semiconductor
material, impurities, crystal defects, temperature, and so forth, and there is no typical
value to quote. It can be anywhere from nanoseconds to seconds. Later it will be
shown that certain applications require a short τh, as in fast switching of pn junctions,
whereas others require a long τh, for example, persistent luminescence.
Sketch the hole concentration when a step illumination is applied
to an n-type semiconductor at time t = 0 and switched off at time t = toff (≫ τh).

SOLUTION

We use Equation 5.27 with Gph = constant in 0 ≤ t ≤ toff. Since Equation 5.27 is a first-order
differential equation, integrating it we simply find
Δpn
t

ln[ Gph − (
τh )]
τh

where C1 is the integration constant. At t = 0, Δpn = 0, so C1 = ln Gph. Therefore, the
solution is

Δpn (t) = τhGph[ 1 − exp(− )]
τh

0 ≤ t < toff

[5.28]

We see that as soon as the illumination is turned on, the minority carrier concentration
rises exponentially toward its steady-state value Δpn(∞) = τhGph. This is reached after a time
t > τh.
At the instant the illumination is switched off, we assume that toff ≫ τh so that from
Equation 5.28,
Δpn(toff) = τhGph

We can define t′ to be the time measured from t = toff, that is, t′ = t − toff. Then
Δpn(t′ = 0) = τhGph

[5.29]

We see that the excess minority carrier concentration decays exponentially from the
instant the light is switched off with a time constant equal to the minority carrier recombination time. The time evolution of the minority carrier concentration is sketched in
Figure 5.28.
Suppose that a direct bandgap semiconductor with no traps is
illuminated with light of intensity I(λ) and wavelength λ that will cause photogeneration as
shown in Figure 5.29. The area of illumination is A = (L × W), and the thickness (depth)
of the semiconductor is D. Assume that all incident photons are absorbed. If η is the quantum efficiency (number of free EHPs generated per absorbed photon) and τ is the recombination lifetime of the photogenerated carriers, show that the steady-state photoconductivity,

SOLUTION

If Γph is the number of photons arriving per unit area per unit second (the photon flux density),
then Γph = I∕hf where I is the light intensity (energy flowing per unit area per second) and
hf is the photon energy. The quantum efficiency η is defined as the number of free EHPs
generated per absorbed photon. Thus, the number of EHPs generated per unit volume per

or 6.5 mA

We assumed that all the incident radiation is absorbed. If this is not the case, the photoconductivity and hence the photocurrent will be smaller. Further we assumed that the photogeneration of carriers is uniform over the area LW and along the thickness D. Usually
photogeneration along D is not uniform.

5.6

DIFFUSION AND CONDUCTION EQUATIONS,
AND RANDOM MOTION

It is well known that, by virtue of their random motion, gas particles diffuse from
high-concentration regions to low-concentration regions. When a perfume bottle is
opened at one end of a room, the molecules diffuse out from the bottle and, after a
while, can be smelled at the other end of the room. Whenever there is a concentration gradient of particles, there is a net diffusional motion of particles in the direction of decreasing concentration. The origin of diffusion lies in the random motion
of particles. To quantify particle flow, we define the particle flux density Γ just
like current density, as the number of particles (not charges) crossing unit area per
unit time. Thus if ΔN particles cross an area A in time Δt, then, by definition,
Γ=

ΔN
A Δt

[5.31]

Clearly if the particles are charged with a charge Q (−e for electrons and +e for
holes), then the electric current density J, which is basically a charge flux density,
is related to the particle flux density Γ by
J = QΓ

[5.32]

Suppose that the electron concentration at some time t in a semiconductor
decreases in the x direction and has the profile n(x, t) shown in Figure 5.30a. This
may have been achieved, for example, by photogeneration at one end of a semiconductor. We will assume that the electron concentration changes only in the x direction

(xo − ℓ) than coming from the right (xo + ℓ).

so that the diffusion of electrons can be simplified to a one-dimensional problem as
depicted in Figure 5.30a. We know that in the absence of an electric field, the electron motion is random and involves scattering from lattice vibrations and impurities.
Suppose that ℓ is the mean free path in the x direction and τ is the mean free time
between the scattering events. The electron moves a mean distance ℓ in the +x or
−x direction and then it is scattered and changes direction. Its mean speed along x
is vx = ℓ∕τ. Let us evaluate the flow of electrons in the +x and −x directions through
the plane at xo and hence find the net flow in the +x direction.
We can divide the x axis into hypothetical segments of length ℓ so that each
segment corresponds to a mean free path. Going across a segment, the electron
experiences one scattering process. Consider what happens during one mean free
time, the time it takes for the electrons to move across a segment toward the left or
right. Half of the electrons in (xo − ℓ) would be moving toward xo and the other half
away from xo, and in time τ half of them will reach xo and cross as shown in
Figure 5.30b. If n1 is the concentration of electrons at xo − 21ℓ, then the number of
electrons moving toward the right to cross xo is 12 n1Aℓ where A is the cross-sectional
area and hence Aℓ is the volume of the segment. Similarly half of the electrons in
(xo + ℓ) would be moving toward the left and in time τ would reach xo. Their number
is 12 n2 Aℓ where n2 is the concentration at xo + 21ℓ. The net number of electrons crossing xo per unit time per unit area in the +x direction is the electron flux density Γe,

or
Γe = −De

dn

[5.34]

where the quantity (ℓ2∕2τ) has been defined as the diffusion coefficient of electrons
and denoted by De. Thus, the net electron flux density Γe at a position x is proportional to the concentration gradient and the diffusion coefficient. The steeper this
gradient, the larger the flux density Γe. In fact, we can view the concentration gradient
dn∕dx as the driving force for the diffusion flux, just like the electric field −(dV∕dx)
is the driving force for the electric current: J = σE = −σ(dV∕dx).
Equation 5.34 is called Fick’s first law and represents the relationship between
the net particle flux and the driving force, which is the concentration gradient. It is
the counterpart of Ohm’s law for diffusion. De has the dimensions of m2 s−1 and is
a measure of how readily the particles (in this case, electrons) diffuse in the medium.
Note that Equation 5.34 gives the electron flux density Γe at a position x where the
electron concentration gradient is dn∕dx. Since from Figure 5.30, the slope dn∕dx is
a negative number, Γe in Equation 5.34 comes out positive, which indicates that the
flux is in the positive x direction. The electric current (conventional current) due to
the diffusion of electrons to the right will be in the negative direction by virtue of
Equation 5.32. Representing this electric current density due to diffusion as JD,e we
can write

Suppose that there is also a positive electric field Ex acting along +x in
Figures 5.30 and 5.31. A practical example is shown in Figure 5.32 in which a
semiconductor is sandwiched between two electrodes, the left one semitransparent.
By connecting a battery to the electrodes, an applied field of Ex is set up in the
semiconductor along +x. The left electrode is continuously illuminated, so excess
EHPs are generated at this surface that give rise to concentration gradients in n and p.
The applied field imposes an electrical force on the charges, which then try to drift.
Holes drift toward the right and electrons toward the left. Charge motion then
involves both drift and diffusion. The total current density due to the electrons drifting, driven by Ex, and also diffusing, driven by dn∕dx, is then given by adding
Equation 5.35 to the usual electron drift current density,
Je = enμeEx + eDe

In this case the drift and diffusion currents are in the same direction.
We mentioned that the diffusion coefficient is a measure of the ease with which
the diffusing charge carriers move in the medium. But drift mobility is also a measure of the ease with which the charge carriers move in the medium. The two quantities are related through the Einstein relation,

and

[5.39]

relation

In other words, the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the temperature and
mobility. This is a reasonable expectation since increasing the temperature will
increase the mean speed and thus accelerate diffusion. The randomizing effect
against diffusion in one particular direction is the scattering of the carriers from
lattice vibrations, impurities, and so forth, so that the longer the mean free path
between scattering events, the larger the diffusion coefficient. This is examined in
Example 5.15.
We equated the diffusion coefficient D to ℓ2∕2τ in Equation 5.34. Our analysis,
as represented in Figure 5.30, is oversimplified because we simply assumed that all
electrons move a distance ℓ before scattering and all are free for a time τ. We essentially assumed that all those at a distance ℓ from xo and moving toward xo cross the
plane exactly in time τ. This assumption is not entirely true because scattering is a
stochastic process and consequently not all electrons moving toward xo will cross it
even in the segment of thickness ℓ. A rigorous statistical analysis shows that the
diffusion coefficient is given by
D=

ℓ2
τ

[5.40]

THE EINSTEIN RELATION Using the relation between the drift mobility and the mean free
time τ between scattering events and the expression for the diffusion coefficient D = ℓ 2∕τ,
derive the Einstein relation for electrons.
SOLUTION

In one dimension, for example, along x, the diffusion coefficient for electrons is given by
De = ℓ 2∕τ where ℓ is the mean free path along x and τ is the mean free time between scattering events for electrons. The mean free path ℓ = vxτ, where vx is the mean (or effective)
speed of the electrons along x. Thus,
De = v 2x τ

Further, we know from Chapter 2 that the electron drift mobility μe is related to the mean

De =

e

which is the Einstein relation. We assumed that Boltzmann statistics, that is, v 2x = kT∕m*e is
applicable, which, of course, is true for the conduction band electrons in a semiconductor but
not for the conduction electrons in a metal. Thus, the Einstein relation is only valid for electrons and holes in a nondegenerate semiconductor and certainly not valid for electrons in a
metal. (A more rigorous derivation can be found in Question 5.24.)

in the semiconductor where the electron concentrations are n1 and n2? If the donor profile in
an n-type semiconductor is Nd (x) = Ndo exp(−x∕b), where b is a characteristic of the exponential doping profile, evaluate the built-in field Ex. What is your conclusion?
SOLUTION

Consider a nonuniformly doped n-type semiconductor in which immediately after doping the
donor concentration, and hence the electron concentration, decreases toward the right. Initially, the sample is neutral everywhere. The electrons will immediately diffuse from higherto lower-concentration regions. But this diffusion accumulates excess electrons in the right
region and exposes the positively charged donors in the left region, as depicted in Figure 5.33.
Figure 5.33 Nonuniform doping profile results in
electron diffusion toward the less concentrated
regions.
This exposes positively charged donors and sets up
a built-in field Ex. In the steady state, the diffusion of
electrons toward the right is balanced by their drift
toward the left.

The electric field between the accumulated negative charges and the exposed donors prevents
further accumulation. Equilibrium is reached when the diffusion toward the right is just balanced by the drift of electrons toward the left. The total current in the sample must be zero

To find the built-in field, we will assume that (and this is a reasonable assumption) the

Note: As a result of the fabrication process, the base region of a bipolar transistor has

transistor operation as discussed in Chapter 6.

5.7.1 TIME-DEPENDENT CONTINUITY EQUATION
Many semiconductor devices operate on the principle that excess charge carriers are
injected into a semiconductor by external means such as illumination or an applied
voltage. The injection of carriers upsets the equilibrium concentration. To determine
the carrier concentration at any point at any instant we need to solve the continuity
equation, which is based on accounting for the total charge within a small volume

Consider an infinitesimally thin elemental volume A δx as in Figure 5.34 in
which the instantaneous hole concentration is pn(x, t). The current density at x due
to holes flowing into the volume is Jh and that due to holes flowing out at x + δx
is Jh + δJh. There is a change in the hole current density Jh; that is, Jh(x, t) is not
uniform along x. (Recall that the total current will also have a component due to
electrons.) We assume that Jh(x, t) and pn(x, t) do not change across the cross section
along the y or z directions. If δJh is negative, then the current leaving the volume is
less than that entering the volume, which leads to an increase in the hole concentration
in A δx. Thus,

where τh is the hole recombination time (lifetime), Gph is the photogeneration rate

Equation 5.44 is called the continuity equation for holes. The current density
Jh is given by diffusion and drift components in Equation 5.38. There is a similar
expression for electrons as well, but the negative sign multiplying ∂Je∕∂x is changed
to positive because the electron charge is negative. Put differently, the electron flow
is in the opposite direction to the conventional current flow. (The decrease in the
current density actually decreases the electron concentration in Aδx.)
The solutions of the continuity equation depend on the initial and boundary
conditions. Many device scientists and engineers have solved Equation 5.44 for various semiconductor problems to characterize the behavior of devices. In most cases

numerical solutions are necessary as analytical solutions are not mathematically tractable. As a simple example, consider uniform illumination of the surface of a semiconductor with suitable electrodes at its end as in Figure 5.29. Photogeneration and
current density do not vary with distance along the sample length, so ∂Jh∕∂x = 0.
If Δpn is the excess concentration, Δpn = pn − pno, then the time derivative of pn in

The hole current density Jh would have diffusion and drift components. If we
assume that the electric field is very small, we can use Equation 5.38 with E ≈ 0 in
Equation 5.46. Further, since the excess concentration Δpn(x) = pn(x) − pno, we
obtain,

[5.47]

where, by definition, Lh = √Dhτh and is called the diffusion length of holes. Equation 5.47 describes the steady-state behavior of minority carrier concentration in a
semiconductor under time-invariant excitation. When the appropriate boundary conditions are also included, its solution gives the spatial dependence of the excess
minority carrier concentration Δpn(x).
In Figure 5.35a, both excess electrons and holes are photogenerated at the surface, but the percentage increase in the concentration of holes is much more dramatic
since pno ≪ nno. We will assume weak injection, that is, Δpn ≪ nno. Suppose that
illumination is such that it causes the excess hole concentration at x = 0 to be Δpn(0).
As holes diffuse toward the right, they meet electrons and recombine as a result of
which the hole concentration pn(x) decays with distance into the semiconductor. If
the bar is very long, then far away from the injection end we would expect pn to be
equal to the thermal equilibrium concentration pno. The solution of Equation 5.47
with these boundary conditions shows that Δpn(x) decays exponentially as
x
Δpn (x) = Δpn (0) exp(− )

[5.48]

This decay in the hole concentration results in a hole diffusion current ID,h(x)
that has the same spatial dependence. Thus, if A is the cross-sectional area, the hole

It is apparent that the hole and electron diffusion currents are in opposite directions. At the surface, the electron and hole diffusion currents are equal and opposite,
so the total current is zero. As apparent from Equations 5.49 and 5.52, the hole
diffusion current decays more rapidly than the electron diffusion current, so there
must be some electron drift to keep the total current zero. The electrons are majority carriers which means that even a small field can cause a marked majority carrier
drift current. If Idrift,e is the electron drift current, then in an open circuit the total
current I = ID,h + ID,e + Idrift,e = 0, so
Idrift,e = −ID,h − ID,e

[5.55]

The electron drift current increases with distance, so the total current I at every
location is zero. It must be emphasized that there must be some field E in the
sample, however small, to provide the necessary drift to balance the currents to zero.
The field can be found from Idrift,e ≈ Aenno μeE, inasmuch as nno does not change

We can use actual values to gauge magnitudes. Suppose that A = 1 mm2 and
Nd = 1016 cm−3 so that nno = Nd = 1016 cm−3 and pno = n2i∕Nd = 1 × 104 cm−3. The
light intensity is adjusted to yield Δpn(0) = 0.05nno = 5 × 1014 cm−3: weak injection.
Typical values at 300 K for the material properties in this Nd -doped n-type Si
would be τh = 480 ns, μe = 1350 cm2 V−1 s−1, De = 34.9 cm2 s−1, Le = 0.0041 cm =

Show that the mean distance diffused by the minority carriers before recombination is Lh.
SOLUTION

Continuous illumination means that we have steady-state conditions and thus Equation 5.47
can be used. The general solution of this second-order differential equation is
x
x
Δpn (x) = A exp(− ) + B exp( )
Lh
Lh

[5.58]

where A and B are constants that have to be found from the boundary conditions. For an
infinite bar, at x = ∞, Δpn(∞) = 0 gives B = 0. At x = 0, Δpn = Δpn(0); so A = Δpn(0).
Thus, the excess (photoinjected) hole concentration at position x is
x
Δpn (x) = Δpn (0) exp(− )
Lh

[5.59]

which is shown in Figure 5.35a. To find the mean position of the photoinjected holes, we
use the definition of the “mean,” that is,
x=

∫0∞x Δpn (x) dx
∫0∞ Δpn (x) dx

Substituting for Δpn(x) from Equation 5.59 and carrying out the integration gives x = Lh.
We conclude that the diffusion length Lh is the average distance diffused by the minority
carriers before recombination. As a corollary, we should infer that 1∕Lh is the mean probability
per unit distance that the hole recombines with an electron.

10
Remember that the analysis here is only approximate and, further, it was based on neglecting the hole drift
current and taking the field as nearly zero to use Equation 5.47 in deriving the carrier concentration profiles.
Note that hole drift current is much smaller than the other current components.

OPTICAL ABSORPTION

OPTICAL ABSORPTION

We have already seen that a photon of energy hf greater than Eg can be absorbed in
a semiconductor, resulting in the excitation of an electron from the valence band to
the conduction band, as illustrated in Figure 5.36. The average energy of electrons
in the conduction band is 32 kT above Ec (average kinetic energy is 32 kT ), which means
that the electrons are very close to Ec. If the photon energy is much larger than the
bandgap energy Eg, then the excited electron is not near Ec and has to lose the extra
energy hf − Eg to reach thermal equilibrium. The excess energy hf − Eg is lost to
lattice vibrations as heat as the electron is scattered from one atomic vibration to
another. This process is called thermalization. If, on the other hand, the photon
energy hf is less than the bandgap energy, the photon will not be absorbed and we
can say that the semiconductor is transparent to wavelengths longer than hc∕Eg provided that there are no energy states in the bandgap. There, of course, will be reflections occurring at the air/semiconductor surface due to the change in the refractive
index.
The excitation of the electron in Figure 5.35 occurs from the top of the valence
band to an energy hf − Eg above Ec, that is, the photogenerated hole is almost at
Ev. This is not generally true and the example shown assumes that the effective
mass of the electron is much lighter than that of the hole so that all the excess energy
(hf − Eg) goes to the KE of the electron as in the case of Ge, Si, and GaAs. The
electron receives much higher kinetic energy than the hole. (See Question 5.30.)
Suppose that Io is the intensity of a beam of photons incident on a semiconductor
material. Thus, Io is the energy incident per unit area per unit time. If Γph is the
photon flux density, then
Io = hf Γph

When the photon energy is greater than Eg, photons from the incident radiation will
be absorbed by the semiconductor. The absorption of photons requires the excitation
of valence band electrons, and there are only so many of them with the right energy
per unit volume. Consequently, absorption depends on the thickness of the semiconductor. Suppose that I(x) is the light intensity at x and δI is the change in the light
intensity in the small elemental volume of thickness δx at x due to photon absorption,

as illustrated in Figure 5.37. Then δI will depend on the number of photons arriving
at this volume I(x) and the thickness δx. Thus
δI = −αI δx

where α is a proportionality constant that depends on the photon energy and hence
wavelength, that is, α = α(λ). The negative sign ensures that δI is a reduction. The
constant α as defined by this equation is called the absorption coefficient of the
semiconductor. It is therefore defined by

which has the dimensions of length−1 (m−1).
When we integrate Equation 5.60 for illumination with a constant wavelength
light, we get the Beer–Lambert law, the transmitted intensity decreases exponentially with the thickness,
Beer–Lambert
law

I(x) = Io exp(− αx)

[5.61]

As apparent from Equation 5.61, over a distance x = 1∕α, the light intensity
falls to a value 0.37Io; that is, it decreases by 63 percent. This distance over which
67 percent of the photons are absorbed is called the penetration depth, denoted by
δ = 1∕α.
The absorption coefficient depends on the photon absorption processes occurring
in the semiconductor. In the case of band-to-band (interband) absorption, α
increases rapidly with the photon energy hf above Eg as shown for Si (Eg = 1.1 eV)
and GaAs (Eg = 1.42 eV) in Figure 5.38. Notice that α is plotted on a logarithmic
scale. The general trend of the α versus hf behavior can be intuitively understood
from the density of states diagram also shown in the same figure.
Density of states g(E) represents the number of states per unit energy per unit
volume. We assume that the VB states are filled and the CB states are empty since
the number of electrons in the CB is much smaller than the number of states in this
band (n ≪ Nc). The photon absorption process increases when there are more VB
states available as more electrons can be excited. We also need available CB states
into which the electrons can be excited, otherwise the electrons cannot find empty
states to fill. The probability of photon absorption depends on both the density of

Figure 5.38 The absorption coefficient α depends on the photon energy hf and hence on the wavelength.
Density of states increases from band edges and usually exhibits peaks and troughs. Generally α increases with the
photon energy greater than Eg because more energetic photons can excite electrons from populated regions of the VB
to numerous available (empty) states deep in the CB.

VB states and the density of CB states. For photons of energy hf A = Eg, the absorption can only occur from Ev to Ec where the VB and CB densities of states are low
and thus the absorption coefficient is small, which is illustrated as A in Figure 5.38.
For photon energies hf B, which can take electrons from very roughly the middle
region of the VB to the middle of the CB, the densities of states are large and α is
also large as indicated by B in Figure 5.38. Furthermore, there are more choices of
excitation for the hf B photon as illustrated by the three arrows in the figure. At even
higher photon energies, photon absorption can of course excite electrons from the
VB into vacuum. In reality, the density of states g(E) of a real crystalline semiconductor is much more complicated with various sharp peaks and troughs on the density of states function, shown as dashed curves in g(E) in Figure 5.38, particularly
away from the band edges. In addition, the absorption process has to satisfy the
conservation of momentum and quantum mechanical transition rules which means
that certain transitions from the CB to the VB will be more favorable than others.
For example, GaAs is a direct bandgap semiconductor, so photon absorption can
lead directly to the excitation of an electron from the CB to the VB for photon energies just above Eg just as direct recombination of an electron and hole results in
photon emission. Si is an indirect bandgap semiconductor. Just as direct electron
and hole recombination is not possible in silicon, the electron excitation from states
near Ev to states near Ec must be accompanied by the emission or absorption of lattice vibrations, and hence the absorption is less efficient; α versus hf for GaAs rises
more sharply than that for Si above Eg as apparent in Figure 5.38. At sufficiently
high photon energies, it is possible to excite electrons directly from the VB to the
CB in Si and this gives the sharp rise in α versus hf before B in Figure 5.38. (Bandto-band absorption is further discussed in Chapter 9.)

Suppose PL is the power in the laser beam; then PL = IA, where I is the intensity of the beam

These carriers thermalize—lose their excess energy as lattice vibrations (heat) via collisions with the lattice—so eventually their average kinetic energy becomes 32 kT above Eg as
depicted in Figure 5.36. Remember that we assume that electrons in the CB are nearly free,
so they must obey the kinetic theory and hence have an average kinetic energy of 32 kT . The
average energy of the electron is then Eg + 23 kT ≈ 1.46 eV. The excess energy

Notice that in this example, and also in Figure 5.36, we have assigned the excess energy
ΔE = hf − Eg − 23kT to the electron rather than share it between the electron and the hole
that is photogenerated. This assumption depends on the ratio of the electron and hole effective
masses, and hence depends on the semiconductor material. It is approximately true in GaAs
because the electron is much lighter than the hole, almost 10 times, and consequently the
absorbed photon is able to “impart” a much higher kinetic energy to the electron than to the
hole; hf − Eg is used in the photogeneration, and the remainder goes to impart kinetic energy
to the photogenerated electron hole pair.

5.9

PIEZORESISTIVITY

When a mechanical stress is applied to a semiconductor sample, as shown in Figure
5.39a, it is found that the resistivity of the semiconductor changes by an amount that
depends on the stress.11 Piezoresistivity is the change in the resistivity of a semiconductor (indeed, any material), due to an applied stress. Elastoresistivity refers to
the change in the resistivity due to an induced strain in the substance. Since the
application of stress invariably leads to strain, piezoresistivity and elastoresistivity
refer to the same phenomenon. Piezoresistivity is fruitfully utilized in a variety of
useful sensor applications such as force, pressure and strain gauges, accelerometers,
and microphones.
The change in the resistivity may be due to a change in the concentration of
carriers or due to a change in the drift mobility of the carriers, both of which can
be modified by a strain in the crystal. Typically, in an extrinsic or doped semiconductor, the concentration of carriers does not change as significantly as the drift
mobility; the piezoresistivity is then associated with the change in the mobility. For
example, in an n-type Si, the change in the electron mobility μe with mechanical
strain εm, dμe∕dεm, is of the order of 105 cm2 V−1 s−1, so that a strain of 0.015 percent will result in a change in the mobility that is about 1 percent, and a similar
change in the resistivity, which is readily measurable. In this case, the change in the
mobility μe is due to the induced strain changing the effective mass m*e which then
modifies μe. (Recall that μe = eτ∕m*e , where τ is the mean scattering time.)
The change in the resistivity δρ has been shown to be proportional to the induced
strain in the crystal and hence proportional to the applied stress σm. The fractional
change δρ∕ρ can be written as
δρ
= πσm
ρ

[5.62]

11
Mechanical stress is defined as the applied force per unit area, σm = F∕A, and the resulting strain εm is the
fractional change in the length of a sample caused by σm; εm = δL∕L, where L is the sample length. The two are
related through the elastic modulus Y; σm = Yεm. Subscript m is used to distinguish the stress σm and strain εm
from the conductivity σ and permittivity ε.

where π is a constant called the piezoresistive coefficient; π has the units of 1/stress,
e.g., m2∕N or 1∕Pa. The piezoresistive coefficient π depends on the type of doping,
p- or n-type; the dopant concentration; the temperature; and the crystallographic
direction. A stress along a certain direction in a crystal, for example, along the length
of a semiconductor crystal, will change the resistivity not only in the same direction
but also in transverse directions. We know from elementary mechanics that a strain
in one direction is accompanied by a transverse strain, as implied by the Poisson
ratio, so it is not unexpected that a stress in one direction will also modify the resistivity in a transverse direction. Thus, the change in the resistivity of a semiconductor in a “longitudinal” direction, taken as the direction of current flow, is due to
stresses in the longitudinal and transverse directions. If σL is the stress along a
longitudinal direction, the direction of current flow, and σT is the stress along a

5.9

transverse direction, as in Figure 5.39b, then, generally, the fractional change in the
resistivity along the current flow direction (longitudinal direction) is given by
δρ
= πLσL + πT σT
ρ

[5.63]

where πL is the piezoresistive coefficient along a longitudinal direction (different for
p- and n-type Si), and πT is the piezoresistive coefficient in the transverse direction.
The piezoresistive effect is actually more complicated than what we have implied.
In reality, we have to consider six types of stresses, three uniaxial stresses along the
x, y, and z directions (e.g., trying to pull the crystal along in three independent directions) and three shear stresses (e.g., trying to shear the crystal in three independent
ways). In very simple terms, a change in the resistivity (δρ∕ρ)i along a particular
direction i (an arbitrary direction) can be induced by a stress σj along another direction j (which may or may not be identical to i). The two, (δρ∕ρ)i and σj, are then
related through a piezoresistivity coefficient denoted by πij. Consequently, the full
description of piezoresistivity involves tensors, and the piezoresistivity coefficients
πij form the elements of this tensor; a treatment beyond the scope of this book.
Nonetheless, it is useful to be able to calculate πL and πT from various tabulated
piezoresistivity coefficients πij, without having to learn tensors. It turns out that it is
sufficient to identify three principal piezoresistive coefficients to describe the piezoresistive effect in cubic crystals, which are denoted as π11, π12, and π44. From the
latter set we can easily calculate πL and πT for a crystallographic direction of interest;
the relevant equations can be found in advanced textbooks.
Advances in silicon fabrication technologies and micromachining (ability to fabricate micromechanical structures) have now enabled various piezoresistive silicon
microsensors to be developed that have a wide range of useful applications. Figure
5.39c shows a very simple Si microcantilever in which an applied force F to the free
end bends the cantilever; the tip of the cantilever is deflected by a distance h. According to elementary mechanics, this deflection induces a maximum stress σm that is at
the surface, at the support end, of the cantilever. A properly placed piezoresistor at
this end can be used to measure this stress σm, and hence the deflection or the force.
The piezoresistor is implanted by selectively diffusing dopants into the Si cantilever

at the support end. Obviously, we need to relate the deflection h of the cantilever
tip to the stress σm, which is well described in mechanics. In addition, h is proportional to the applied force F through a factor that depends on the elastic modulus
and the geometry of the cantilever. Thus, we can measure both the displacement (h)
and force (F ).
Another useful application is in pressure sensors, which are commercially available. Again, the structure is fabricated from Si. A very thin elastic membrane, called
a diaphragm, has four piezoresistors embedded, by appropriate dopant diffusion, on
its surface as shown in Figure 5.39d. Under pressure, the Si diaphragm deforms
elastically, and the stresses that are generated by this deformation cause the resistance
of the piezoresistors to change. There are four piezoresistors because the four are
connected in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement for better signal detection. The diaphragm area is typically 1 mm × 1 mm, and the thickness is 20 μm. There is no
doubt that recent advances in micromachining have made piezoresistivity an important topic for a variety of sensor applications.

EXAMPLE 5.21

PIEZORESISTIVE STRAIN GAUGE Suppose that we apply a stress σL along the length, taken
along the [110] direction, of a p-type silicon crystal sample. We will measure the resistivity
along this direction by passing a current along the length and measuring the voltage drop
between two fixed points as in Figure 5.39a. The stress σL along the length will result in a
strain εL along the same length given by εL = σL∕Y, where Y is the elastic modulus. From
Equation 5.63 the change in the resistivity is
Δρ
= πLσL + πT σT = πLYεL
ρ

where we have ignored the presence of any transverse stresses; σT ≈ 0. These transverse
stresses depend on how the piezoresistor is used, that is, whether it is allowed to contract
laterally. If the resistor cannot contract, it must be experiencing a transverse stress. In any
event, for the particular direction of interest, [110], the Poisson ratio is very small (less than
0.1), and we can simply neglect any σT. Clearly, we can find the strain εL from the measurement of Δρ∕ρ, which is the principle of the strain gauge. The gauge factor G of a strain
gauge measures the sensitivity of the gauge in terms of the fractional change in the resistance
per unit strain,

where we have assumed that ΔR is dominated by Δρ, since the effects from geometric changes
in the sample shape can be ignored compared with the piezoresistive effect in semiconductors.
Using typical values for a p-type Si piezoresistor which has a length along [110], Y ≈ 170 GPa,
πL ≈ 72 × 10−11 Pa−1, we find G ≈ 122. This is much greater than G ≈ 1.7 for metal resistor–
based strain gauges. In most metals, the fractional change in the resistance ΔR∕R is due to
the geometric effect, the sample becoming elongated and narrower, whereas in semiconductors
it is due to the piezoresistive effect.

SCHOTTKY JUNCTION

5.10.1 SCHOTTKY DIODE
We consider what happens when a metal and an n-type semiconductor are brought
into contact. In practice, this process is frequently carried out by the evaporation of
a metal onto the surface of a semiconductor crystal in vacuum.
The energy band diagrams for the metal and the semiconductor are shown in
Figure 5.40. The work function, denoted as Φ, is the energy difference between the
vacuum level and the Fermi level. The vacuum level defines the energy where the
electron is free from that particular solid and where the electron has zero KE.
For the metal, the work function Φm is the minimum energy required to remove
an electron from the solid. In the metal there are electrons at the Fermi level EFm,
but in the semiconductor there are none at EFn. Nonetheless, the semiconductor work
function Φn still represents the energy required to remove an electron from the semiconductor. It may be thought that the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the semiconductor is simply the electron affinity χ, but this is not so.
Thermal equilibrium requires that only a certain fraction of all the electrons in the
semiconductor should be in the CB at a given temperature. When an electron is
removed from the conduction band, then thermal equilibrium can be maintained only
if an electron is excited from the VB to CB, which involves absorbing heat (energy)
John Bardeen, Walter Schottky, and Walter Brattain. Walter H. Schottky
(1886–1976) obtained his PhD from the University of Berlin in 1912.
He made many distinct contributions to physical electronics. He
invented the screen grid vacuum tube in 1915, and the tetrode
vacuum tube in 1919 while at Siemens. The Schottky junction theory
was formulated in 1938. He also made distinct contributions to
thermal and shot noise in devices. His book Thermodynamik was
published in 1929 and included an explanation of the Schottky
defect (Chapter 1).

from the environment; thus it takes more energy than simply χ. We will not derive
the effective thermal energy required to remove an electron but state that, as for a
metal, this is equal to Φn, even though there are no electrons at EFn. In fact, the
thermionic emission of electrons from a heated semiconductor is also described by
the Richardson–Dushman expression in Equation 4.39 but with Φ representing the
work function of the semiconductor, Φn in the present n-type case. (In contrast, the
minimum photon energy required to remove an electron from a semiconductor above
absolute zero would be the electron affinity.)
We assume that Φm > Φn, the work function of the metal is greater than that of
the semiconductor. When the two solids come into contact, the more energetic electrons in the CB of the semiconductor can readily tunnel into the metal in search of
lower empty energy levels ( just above EFm) and accumulate near the surface of the
metal, as illustrated in Figure 5.40. Electrons tunneling from the semiconductor leave
behind an electron-depleted region of width W in which there are exposed positively
charged donors, in other words, net positive space charge. The contact potential,
called the built-in potential Vo, therefore develops between the metal and the semiconductor. There is obviously also a built-in electric field Eo from the positive
charges to the negative charges on the metal surface. Eventually this built-in potential reaches a value that prevents further accumulation of electrons at the metal
surface and an equilibrium is reached. The value of the built-in voltage Vo is the

5 .1 0

SCHOTTKY JUNCTION

same as that in the metal–metal junction case in Chapter 4, namely, (Φm − Φn)∕e.
The depletion region has been depleted of free carriers (electrons) and hence contains the exposed positive donors. This region thus constitutes a space charge layer
(SCL) in which there is a nonuniform internal field directed from the semiconductor
to the metal surface. The maximum value of this built-in field is denoted as Eo and
occurs right at the metal–semiconductor junction (this is where there are a maximum
number of field lines from positive to negative charges).
The Fermi level throughout the whole solid, the metal and semiconductor in
contact, must be uniform in equilibrium. Otherwise, a change in the Fermi level
ΔEF going from one end to the other end will be available to do external (electrical)
work. Thus, EFm and EFn line up. The W region, however, has been depleted of
electrons, so in this region Ec − EFn must increase so that n decreases. The bands
must bend to increase Ec − EFn toward the junction, as depicted in Figure 5.40. Far
away from the junction, we, of course, still have an n-type semiconductor. The bending is just enough for the vacuum level to be continuous and changing by Φm − Φn
from the semiconductor to the metal, as this much energy is needed to take an
electron across from the semiconductor to the metal. The PE barrier for electrons
moving from the metal to the semiconductor is called the Schottky barrier height
ΦB, which is given by
ΦB = Φm − χ = eVo + (Ec − EFn)

[5.64]

which is greater than eVo.
Under open circuit conditions, there is no net current flowing through the metal–
semiconductor junction. The number of electrons thermally emitted over the PE
barrier ΦB from the metal to the semiconductor is equal to the number of electrons
thermally emitted over eVo from the semiconductor to the metal. Emission probability depends on the PE barrier for emission through the Boltzmann factor. There are
two current components due to electrons flowing through the junction. The current
due to electrons being thermally emitted from the metal to the CB of the semiconductor is

W has a much larger resistance than the neutral n-region (outside W) and the metal
side, nearly all the voltage drop is across the depletion region. The applied bias is
in the opposite direction to the built-in voltage Vo. Thus Vo is reduced to Vo − V. ΦB
remains unchanged. The semiconductor band diagram outside the depletion region
has been effectively shifted up with respect to the metal side by an amount eV because
PE = Charge × Voltage

in Figure 5.41a.

where Jo is a constant that depends on the material and surface properties of the two
solids. In fact, examination of the above steps shows that Jo is also J1 in Equation 5.65.
When the Schottky junction is reverse biased, then the positive terminal is connected to the semiconductor, as illustrated in Figure 5.41b. The applied voltage Vr
drops across the depletion region since this region has very few carriers and is highly
resistive. The built-in voltage Vo thus increases to Vo + Vr. Effectively, the semiconductor band diagram is shifted down with respect to the metal side because the
charge is negative but the voltage is positive and PE = Charge × Voltage. The PE
barrier for thermal emission of electrons from the CB to the metal becomes e(Vo + Vr),
which means that the corresponding current component becomes
J rev
2 = C2 exp[ −

[5.69]

Since generally Vo is typically a fraction of a volt and the reverse bias is more
than a few volts, J2rev ≪ J1 and the reverse bias current is essentially limited by J1
only and is very small. Thus, under reverse bias conditions, the current is primarily
due to the thermal emission of electrons over the barrier ΦB from the metal to the
CB of the semiconductor as determined by Equation 5.65. Figure 5.41c illustrates
the I–V characteristics of a typical Schottky junction. The I–V characteristics exhibit
rectifying properties, and the device is called a Schottky diode. The reverse current
saturates quickly with increasing reverse bias and becomes Jo, which is also known
as the reverse saturation current.12
Jo does have some dependence on the reverse bias Vr. Recall from Chapter 4 that the barrier ΦB will be
reduced by the applied field due to the Schottky effect.

Equation 5.68, which is derived for forward bias conditions, is also valid under
reverse bias by making V negative, that is, V = −Vr. Furthermore, it turns out to be
applicable not only to Schottky-type metal–semiconductor junctions but also to
junctions between a p-type and an n-type semiconductor, pn junctions, as we will
show in Chapter 6. Under a forward bias V, which is greater than 25 mV at room
temperature, the forward current is simply

It should be mentioned that it is also possible to obtain a Schottky junction
between a metal and a p-type semiconductor. This arises when Φm < Φp, where Φp
is the work function for the p-type semiconductor. The reader may have noticed that
the Schottky diode is a majority carrier device, that is, the current depends on the
diffusion of majority carriers; electrons in the n-type semiconductor over onto the
metal side. (In contrast, as explained in Chapter 6, the pn junction diode is a minority carrier device.) Schottky diodes are widely used in high frequency communications, photodiodes, power electronics, and photovoltaics.

5.10.2 SCHOTTKY JUNCTION SOLAR CELL AND PHOTODIODE
The built-in field in the depletion region of the Schottky junction allows this type
of device to function as a photovoltaic device and also as a photodetector. Consider
a Schottky device as in Figure 5.42 in which the metal electrode allows the light to
pass through and enter the semiconductor. The metal contact may be finger
electrodes on the semiconductor, an annular electrode or a sufficiently thin semitransparent electrode. The energy band diagram is shown in Figure 5.42.
For photon energies greater than Eg, EHPs are generated in the depletion region
in the semiconductor, as indicated in Figure 5.42. The field in this region separates

the EHPs and drifts the electrons toward the semiconductor and holes toward the
metal. The drift of these photogenerated carriers gives rise to a photocurrent in the
external circuit. Some of these photogenerated electrons shield the positive donors
near the depletion region boundary, which therefore reduces Eo and hence Vo; shown
as E'o and V'o in Figure 5.42. The semiconductor end therefore becomes a bit more
negative with respect to the situation in the dark or the equilibrium situation. When
a hole reaches the metal, it recombines with an electron and reduces the effective
charge there by one electron, thus making it more positive relative to its dark state.
Thus, a voltage develops across the Schottky junction device with the metal end
positive and semiconductor end negative.
Normally, the device is connected to an external load as in Figure 5.42. The photogenerated electrons that drift and reach the neutral n-region are conducted through the
external leads, through the load, toward the metal side, where they replenish the lost
electrons in the metal. As long as photons are generating EHPs, the flow of electrons
around the external circuit will continue and there will be photon energy to electrical
energy conversion. Sometimes it is useful to think of the neutral n-type semiconductor
region as a “conductor,” an extension of the external wire (except that the n-type semiconductor has a higher resistivity). As soon as the photogenerated electrons cross the
depletion region, they reach the end electrode and are conducted around the external
circuit to the metal side to replenish the lost electron there. The internal field is critical
to the operation because it separates and drifts the photogenerated EHPs.
The photovoltaic explanation in terms of the energy band diagram is simple. At
the point of photogeneration, the electron finds itself at a PE slope as Ec is decreasing toward the semiconductor, as shown in Figure 5.42. It has no option but to roll
down the slope just as a ball that is let go on a slope would roll down the slope to
decrease its gravitational PE. Recall that there are many more empty states in the
CB than electrons, so there is nothing to prevent the electron from rolling down the
CB in search of lower energy. Thus, photogenerated electrons roll down the PE hill
and reach the neutral region whereupon other electrons from the neutral region enter
the external circuit to flow through the load and replenish the lost electrons in the

metal. If we remember that hole energy increases downward on the energy band
diagram, then similar arguments also apply to the photogenerated hole in the VB,
which rolls down its own PE slope to reach the surface of the metal and recombine
with an electron there.
For photon energies less than Eg, the device can still respond, as long as hf can
excite an electron from EFm in the metal over the PE barrier ΦB into the CB, from
where the electron will roll down toward the neutral n-region. In this case, hf must
only be greater than ΦB.
If the Schottky junction diode is reverse-biased, as shown in Figure 5.43, then the
reverse bias Vr increases the built-in potential Vo to Vo + Vr (Vr ≫ Vo). The internal field
increases to substantially high values. This has the advantage of increasing the drift
velocity of the EHPs (vd = μd E) in the depletion region and therefore shortening the
transit time required to cross the depletion width. The device responds faster and is
useful as a fast photodetector. The photocurrent iphoto in the external circuit is due to
the drift of photogenerated carriers in the depletion region and can be readily measured.

SOLUTION

a.

From Figure 5.40, it is clear that the barrier height ΦB is
ΦB = Φm − χ = 4.55 eV − 4.01 eV = 0.54 eV

b.

The experimental value is around 0.66 eV, which is greater than the theoretical value
due to various effects at the metal–semiconductor interface arising from dangling bonds,
defects, and so forth. For example, dangling bonds give rise to what are called surface
states within the bandgap of the semiconductor that can capture electrons and modify
the Schottky energy band diagram. (The energy band diagram in Figure 5.40 represents
an ideal junction with no surface states.) Further, in some cases, such as Pt on n-Si, the
experimental value can be lower than the theoretical value.

electrostatics that the derivative of the field dE∕dx = ρnet∕ε, where ε = εoεr is the permittivity of the medium, and εo and εr are the absolute permittivity and relative permittivity (11.9 for
Si), respectively. We can hence integrate ρnet and find the field in the depletion region. The field

semiconductor junction with all positive charges on the right and all negative charges (electrons on the metal surface) on the left. Further, the derivative of the potential V′ at any point
in the depletion region gives the field E = −dV′∕dx so that we integrate E and find the
voltage as well. (Since V is used for the applied voltage, V′ is used for the potential at an
arbitrary point in the depletion region.) At x = W, the field should be zero, E = 0 and the
potential should be V′ = Vo − V. Thus, we can readily find the width of the depletion region

If the applied voltage is 0.2 V, then we need to use (0.33 − 0.2 V) instead of just 0.33 V in
the above calculation, and the new depletion layer width W = 0.13 μm (narrower). With the
reverse bias V = −5 V, we need to use 0.33 V + 5 V, and the recalculation of the depletion
layer width gives W = 0.84 μm, significantly wider.
The maximum field Eo under open circuit can be found by using Wo = 0.21 μm in
∣Eo∣ = ∣Emax∣ =

Under forwards bias, the width is 0.13 μm and the corresponding field is ∣Emax∣ =
2.0 × 106 V m−1, smaller as we expect. Under reverse bias, using W = 0.84 μm, we find
∣Emax∣ = 12.7 × 106 V m−1, significantly larger. We need more donors to generate the required
field in the depletion region and this means the depletion layer must extend further into the
semiconductor.
Notice that in all cases ∣Emax∣ = 2(Vo − V )∕W. Indeed, the latter equation comes out
directly from the integration of ∣E(x)∣ across W, which should be (Vo − V ). Schottky photodetectors are normally reverse biased to increase the field in the depletion region, which
increases the drift velocity of photogenerated carriers and hence the speed of the response as
well as the photocurrent.

OHMIC CONTACTS AND THERMOELECTRIC COOLERS

OHMIC CONTACTS AND
THERMOELECTRIC COOLERS

An ohmic contact is a junction between a metal and a semiconductor that does
not limit the current flow. The current is essentially limited by the resistance of
the semiconductor outside the contact region rather than the thermal emission
rate of carriers across a potential barrier at the contact. In the Schottky diode, the
I–V characteristics were determined by the thermal emission rate of carriers
across the contact. It should be mentioned that, contrary to intuition, when we
talk about an ohmic contact, we do not generally infer a linear I–V characteristic
for the ohmic contact itself. We only imply that the contact does not limit the
current flow.
Figure 5.44 shows the formation of an ohmic contact between a metal and an
n-type semiconductor. The work function of the metal Φm is smaller than the work
function Φn of the semiconductor. There are more energetic electrons in the metal
than in the CB, which means that the electrons (around EFm) tunnel into the semiconductor in search of lower energy levels, which they find around Ec, as indicated
in Figure 5.44. Consequently, many electrons pile in the CB of the semiconductor
near the junction. Equilibrium is reached when the accumulated electrons in the CB
of the semiconductor prevent further electrons tunneling from the metal. Put more
rigorously, equilibrium is reached when the Fermi level is uniform across the whole
system from one end to the other.
The semiconductor region near the junction in which there are excess electrons
is called the accumulation region. To show the increase in n, we draw the semiconductor energy bands bending downward to decrease Ec − EFn, which increases n. Going
from the far end of the metal to the far end of the semiconductor, there are always
conduction electrons. In sharp contrast, the depletion region of the Schottky junction

separates the conduction electrons in the metal from those in the semiconductor.
It can be seen from the contact in Figure 5.44 that the conduction electrons immediately on either side of the junction (at EFm and Ec) have about the same energy
and therefore there is no barrier involved when they cross the junction in either
direction under the influence of an applied field.
It is clear that the excess electrons in the accumulation region increase the conductivity of the semiconductor in this region. When a voltage is applied to the
structure, the voltage drops across the higher resistance region, which is the bulk
semiconductor region. Both the metal and the accumulation region have comparatively high concentrations of electrons compared with the bulk of the semiconductor.
The current is therefore determined by the resistance of the bulk region. The current
density is then simply J = σE where σ is the conductivity of the semiconductor in
the bulk and E is the applied field in this region.
One of the interesting and important applications of semiconductors is in
thermoelectric, or Peltier, devices, which enable small volumes to be cooled by
direct currents. Whenever a dc current flows through a contact between two dissimilar materials, heat is either released or absorbed in the contact region, depending on
the direction of the current. Suppose that there is a dc current flowing from an n-type
semiconductor to a metal through an ohmic contact, as depicted in Figure 5.45a.
Then electrons are flowing from the metal to the CB of the semiconductor. We only
consider the contact region where the Peltier effect occurs. Current is carried by
electrons near the Fermi level EFm in the metal. These electrons then cross over into

OHMIC CONTACTS AND THERMOELECTRIC COOLERS

the CB of the semiconductor and when they reach the end of the contact region,
their energy is Ec plus average KE (which is 32 kT). There is therefore an increase in the
average energy (PE + KE) per electron in the contact region. The electron must
therefore absorb heat from the environment (lattice vibrations) to gain this energy
as it drifts through the junction. Thus, the passage of an electron from the metal to
the CB of an n-type semiconductor involves the absorption of heat at the junction.
When the current direction is from the metal to the n-type semiconductor, the
electrons flow from the CB of the semiconductor to the Fermi level of the metal as
they pass through the contact. Since EFm is lower than Ec, the passing electron has
to lose energy, which it does to lattice vibrations as heat. Thus, the passage of a CB
electron from the n-type semiconductor to the metal involves the release of heat at
the junction, as indicated in Figure 5.45b.
It is apparent that depending on the direction of the current flow through a junction between a metal and an n-type semiconductor, heat is either absorbed or released
at the junction. Although we considered current flow between a metal and an n-type
semiconductor through an ohmic contact, this thermoelectric effect is a general phenomenon that occurs at a junction between any two dissimilar materials. It is called
the Peltier effect after its discoverer. In the case of metal–p-type semiconductor
junctions, heat is absorbed for current flowing from the metal to the p-type semiconductor and heat is released in the other direction. Thermoelectric effects occurring at metal–semiconductor junctions are summarized in Figure 5.46. It is important
not to confuse the Peltier effect with the Joule heating of the semiconductor and the
metal. Joule heating, which we simply call I 2R (or J 2ρ) heating, arises from the finite
resistivity of the material. It is due to the conduction electrons losing their energy
gained from the field to lattice vibrations when they become scattered by such vibrations, as discussed in Chapter 2.
It is self-evident that when a current flows through a semiconductor sample with
metal contacts at its ends, as depicted in Figure 5.46, one of the contacts will always
absorb heat and the other will always release heat. The contact where heat is absorbed
will be cooled and is called the cold junction, whereas the other contact, where heat

is released, will warm up and is called the hot junction. One can use the cold junction
to cool another body, providing that the heat generated at the hot junction can be
removed from the semiconductor sufficiently quickly to reduce its conduction through
the semiconductor to the cold junction. Furthermore, there will always be the Joule
heating (I 2R) of the whole semiconductor sample since the bulk will always have a
finite resistance.
A simplified schematic diagram of a practical single-element thermoelectric
cooling device is shown in Figure 5.47. It uses two semiconductors, one n-type and
the other p-type, each with ohmic contacts. The current direction therefore has opposite thermoelectric effects. On one side, the semiconductors share the same metal
electrode. Effectively, the structure is an n-type and a p-type semiconductor connected in series through a common metal electrode. Typically, either Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3,
or Sb2Te3 is used as the semiconductor material with copper usually as the metal
electrode.
The current flowing through the n-type semiconductor to the common metal
electrode causes heat absorption, which cools this junction and hence the metal. The
same current then enters the p-type semiconductor and causes heat absorption at this
junction, which cools the same metal electrode. Thus, the common metal electrode
is cooled at both ends. The other ends of the semiconductors are hot junctions. They
are connected to a large heat sink to remove the heat and thus prevent heat conduction through the semiconductors toward the cold junctions. The other face of the
common metal electrode is in contact, through a thin ceramic plate (electrical insulator but thermal conductor), with the body to be cooled. In commercial Peltier
devices, many of these elements are connected in series, as illustrated in Figure 5.48,
to increase the cooling efficiency.

the Peltier cofficient for between a metal and an n-type Si doped with 1016 cm−3 donors?
SOLUTION

Consider Figure 5.45a, which shows only the ohmic contact region between a metal and an
n-type semiconductor when a current is passing through it. The majority of the applied voltage drops across the bulk of the semiconductor because the contact region, or the accumulation region, has an accumulation of electrons in the CB. The current is limited by the bulk
resistance of the semiconductor. Thus, in the contact region we can take the Fermi level to
be almost undisturbed and hence uniform, EFm ≈ EFn. In the bulk of the metal, a conduction
electron is at around EFm (same as EFn), whereas just at the end of the contact region in the
semiconductor it is at Ec plus an average KE of 32 kT . The energy difference is the heat
absorbed per electron going through the contact region. Since I∕e is the rate at which electrons
are flowing through the contact,

so the Peltier coefficient is given by the term in the square brackets. For n type Si that has
Nd = 1016 cm−3, from Equation 5.6 with n = Nd, Ec − EFn = (kT/e)ln(n/Nc) = 0.205 eV, and
Equation 5.72, gives Π = 0.24 W A−1. Thus, a current of 1 A through this metal/n-Si junction
as in Figure 5.45a will lead to the absorption of heat at a rate of 240 mW.
We can increase (Ec − EFn) and hence Π by decreasing the donor concentration Nd. But,
we also need a reasonable amount of doping to increase the conductivity of the bulk to reduce
the Joule heating arising from the current through the semiconductor; Joule heating per unit
volume is ρJ 2, where ρ is the resistivity.

field and a voltage difference. The Seebeck coefficient is defined as dV∕dT, potential difference per unit
temperature difference. (b) In the presence of a temperature gradient in a p-type semiconductor, holes

electrons with greater mean speeds in the hot region than in the cold region. The
average KE of electrons in the conduction band is 12 m*e v 2 = 32 kT , where v is the root
mean square speed of the electron, m*e is the effective mass of the electron. Consequently, electrons diffuse from hot to cold regions, which immediately exposes positively charged donors (e.g., As+) in the hot region and therefore builds up an
internal field and a built-in voltage, as shown in Figure 5.49a. Eventually, an equilibrium is reached when the diffusion of electrons from hot to cold regions is balanced by their reverse drift (from cold to hot), driven by the built-in field. The net
current must be zero. The Seebeck coefficient S measures this effect in terms of the
voltage developed as a result of an applied temperature gradient as14

The sign of S, by convention, is the sign of the voltage developed at the cold
end with respect to (wrt) the hot end. Thus, S is negative for this n-type semiconductor
because electrons accumulate in the cold region as shown in Figure 5.49a.
In a p-type semiconductor, we can assume that we only have holes as the mobile
charge carriers. The acceptors are negatively charged. The same temperature gradient
as in Figure 5.49a results in the diffusion of holes (instead of electrons) from the
hot to cold end as in Figure 5.49b. This diffusion process exposes negative acceptors
in the hot region (instead of positive charge as in the n-type semiconductor). Thus,
in a p-type semiconductor, the Seebeck effect has the reverse sign, or the polarity
of the Seebeck voltage is reversed with respect to that for an n-type for the same
temperature gradient. This effect provides a convenient way to identify whether a
semiconductor is doped n-type or p-type. The simplest test is to touch the test leads
of a voltmeter (1−10 mV range) to a semiconductor with one lead made hot. The
polarity of the cold lead identifies whether it is n- or p-type. In reality, the semiconductor and the copper lead form a thermocouple but the Seebeck coefficient of the
semiconductor is much greater than that of the metal lead.
We can derive the Seebeck coefficient for an n-type semiconductor as follows.
The total current for electrons in Figure 5.49a should be zero, that is, Je = Jdrift +
Jdiffusion = 0. The drift component is simply
Jdrift = enμeEx = enμe(−

[5.75]

The diffusion current is more complicated because not only n changes along x
but also De inasmuch as there is a temperature variation along x. We can go back
to Section 5.6 and rederive the net diffusion flux density Γe in which ℓ and τ depend
14
Although the Seebeck effect was introduced in Chapter 4, it was essentially for metals only. The sign of the
Seebeck effect for semiconductors however follows our intuition that the mobile carriers diffuse away from the
hot region and hence determine the polarity of the Seebeck voltage. The Seebeck voltage is also called the
thermoelectric power (a misnomer). Note that “wrt” in Equation 5.74b is “with respect to”.

The above equation is basically the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for an

AkT r+1∕e. Further, we let ΔE = Ec − EF, so that n = Ncexp(−ΔE∕kT ) = BT 3∕2

nondegenerate semiconductor. We can now substitute all these into Equation 5.78

Both Equations 5.80 and 5.81 contain the index parameter r in μe ∝ T r but this
r is not the same for holes and electrons. Further r can be different over different
temperature ranges. From very simple theoretical arguments we would expect r ≈
−3∕2 for lattice scattering, and r = +3∕2 for impurity scattering under sufficiently
heavy doping as discussed in Section 5.3.2.
There is one additional factor, called the phonon drag, that increases the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient in Equations 5.80 and 5.81, that has been neglected

5 .1 3

DIRECT AND INDIRECT BANDGAP SEMICONDUCTORS

in the above derivation. There is a net phonon flux from the hot to cold region. As
these phonons collide with electrons (or holes) they scatter the electrons towards the
cold side. Thus, the phonon flux can drag carriers towards the cold side and hence
increase the magnitude of both Sn and Sp.
Voltage drifts in various semiconductor devices most commonly arise from temperature gradients generating a net Seebeck voltage that appears as a drift voltage.
Any voltage drift at the input of an operational amplifier would become amplified
and give rise to a drift voltage in the output of the device.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS AND DRIFT IN SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES Consider a
Schottky junction between a metal and an n-type Si. In most cases the metal is a thin film
deposited on a semiconductor crystal to form the junction. The depletion region is very thin
(fraction of a micron). The main device thickness is therefore the n-type Si. Suppose that the
n-side is doped with 1015 donors cm−3 and its thickness is 100 μm or more. What will be the
voltage developed across this device if a temperature fluctuation (for example, during equipment warm up) gives rise to a 0.1 °C temperature difference across the device? Assume that
r = −2 for this n-type Si.
SOLUTION

We can neglect any temperature drop across the metal and the depletion region. The temperature difference ΔT = 0.1 °C therefore develops fully across the n-type Si. Sn in Equation
5.80 depends on (Ec − EF) which depends on the doping concentration Nd. From n = Nd =
Nc exp[−(Ec − EF)∕kT] we have
Ec − EF = kT ln(Nd∕Nc) = (0.0259 eV)ln(1 × 1015∕2.8 × 1019) = 0.265 eV

Equation 5.80 with r = −2 gives

with the cold side being negative. The Seebeck voltage that appears across the device is
ΔV = SnΔT = (−0.926 mV K−1)(0.1 K) = −0.093 mV

which is not a negligible offset voltage, especially if we are looking for small signals. The same
arguments can be also applied to pn junctions. Consider a pn junction in which the p-side is
very thin, the n-side is much thicker than the p-side, the n-side has the same donor concentration as above, and a depletion region that is very thin. This pn junction would give rise to the
same Seebeck voltage as the Schottky device above. Seebeck effects in electronic devices arise
from temperature gradients; and with careful design, they can be reduced to innocuous levels.

where the wavevector kn is essentially a quantum number determined by

where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . The energy increases parabolically with the wavevector kn.
We also know that the electron momentum is given by ħkn. This description can be
used to represent the behavior of electrons in a metal within which their average
potential energy can be taken to be roughly zero. In other words, we take V(x) = 0
within the metal crystal and V(x) to be large [e.g., V(x) = Vo] outside so that the electron is contained within the metal. This is the nearly free electron model of a metal
that has been quite successful in interpreting many of the properties. Indeed, we were
able to calculate the density of states g(E) based on the three-dimensional potential
well problem. It is quite obvious that this model is too simple since it does not take
into account the actual variation of the electron potential energy in the crystal.
The potential energy of the electron depends on its location within the crystal
and is periodic due to the regular arrangement of the atoms. How does a periodic
potential energy affect the relationship between E and k? It will no longer simply be
En = (ħkn)2∕2me.
To find the energy of the electron in a crystal, we need to solve the Schrödinger
equation for a periodic potential energy function in three dimensions. We first consider the hypothetical one-dimensional crystal shown in Figure 5.50. The electron

subject to the condition that the potential energy V(x) is periodic in a, that is,

m = 1, 2, 3, . . .

The solution of Equation 5.83 will give the electron wavefunction in the crystal and hence the electron energy. Since V(x) is periodic, we should expect, by
intuition at least, the solution ψ (x) to be periodic. It turns out that the solutions to
Equation 5.83, which are called Bloch wavefunctions, are of the form
ψk(x) = Uk(x) exp( jkx)

[5.85]

Bloch
wavefunction

where Uk(x) is a periodic function that depends on V(x) and has the same periodicity
a as V(x). The term exp( jkx), of course, represents a traveling wave. We should
remember that we have to multiply this by exp(−jEt∕ħ), where E is the energy, to
get the overall wavefunction Ψ(x, t). Thus the electron wavefunction in the crystal
is a traveling wave that is modulated by Uk(x).
There are many such Bloch wavefunction solutions to the one-dimensional crystal, each identified with a particular k value, say kn, which acts as a kind of quantum
number. Each ψk (x) solution corresponds to a particular kn and represents a state with
an energy Ek. The dependence of the energy Ek on the wavevector k is what we call
the E−k diagram. Figure 5.51 shows a typical E−k diagram for the hypothetical

in its interaction with external fields, for example, those involved in the photon
absorption process. Indeed, the rate of change of ħk is the externally applied force
Fext on the electron such as that due to an electric field (Fext = eE ). Thus, for the
electron within the crystal,
d(ħk)
= Fext
dt

and consequently we call ħk the crystal momentum of the electron.15
Inasmuch as the momentum of the electron in the x direction in the crystal is
given by ħk, the E–k diagram is an energy versus crystal momentum plot. The
states ψk(x) in the lower E–k curve constitute the wavefunctions for the valence
electrons and thus correspond to the states in the VB. Those in the upper E–k curve,
on the other hand, correspond to the states in the conduction band (CB) since they
have higher energies. All the valence electrons at absolute zero of temperature therefore fill the states, particular kn values, in the lower E–k diagram.
It should be emphasized that an E–k curve consists of many discrete points, each
corresponding to a possible state, wavefunction ψk(x), that is allowed to exist in the
crystal. The points are so close that we draw the E–k relationship as a continuous
curve. It is clear from the E–k diagram that there is a range of energies, from Ev to
Ec, for which there are no solutions to the Schrödinger equation and hence there are
no ψk(x) with energies in Ev to Ec. Furthermore, we also note that the E–k behavior
is not a simple parabolic relationship except near the bottom of the CB and the top
of the VB.
Above absolute zero of temperature, due to thermal excitation, however, some
of the electrons from the top of the valence band will be excited to the bottom of
the conduction band. According to the E–k diagram in Figure 5.51, when an electron
and hole recombine, the electron simply drops from the bottom of the CB to the top
of the VB without any change in its k value, so this transition is quite acceptable in
terms of momentum conservation. We should recall that the momentum of the emitted photon is negligible compared with the momentum of the electron. The E–k
diagram in Figure 5.51 is therefore for a direct bandgap semiconductor.
The simple E–k diagram sketched in Figure 5.51 is for a hypothetical onedimensional crystal in which each atom simply bonds with two neighbors. In real
crystals, we have a three-dimensional arrangement of atoms with V(x, y, z) showing
periodicity in more than one direction. The E–k curves are then not as simple as that
in Figure 5.51 and often show unusual features. The E–k diagram for GaAs, which

= Fexternal + Finternal

However, as we are interested in interactions with external forces such as an applied field, we treat ħk as if it
were the momentum of the electron in the crystal and use the name crystal momentum.

that sketched in Figure 5.51. GaAs is therefore a direct bandgap semiconductor in
which electron–hole pairs can recombine directly and emit a photon. It is quite
apparent that light emitting devices use direct bandgap semiconductors to make use
of direct recombination.
In the case of Si, the diamond crystal structure leads to an E–k diagram that has
the essential features depicted in Figure 5.52b. We notice that the minimum of the
CB is not directly above the maximum of the VB. An electron at the bottom of the
CB therefore cannot recombine directly with a hole at the top of the VB because,
for the electron to fall down to the top of the VB, its momentum must change from
kcb to kvb, which is not allowed by the law of conservation of momentum. Thus
direct electron–hole recombination does not take place in Si and Ge. The recombination process in these elemental semiconductors occurs via a recombination center at
an energy level Er. The electron is captured by the defect at Er, from where it can
fall down into the top of the VB. The indirect recombination process is illustrated
in Figure 5.52c. The energy of the electron is lost by the emission of phonons, that
is, lattice vibrations. The E–k diagram in Figure 5.52b for Si is an example of an
indirect bandgap semiconductor.
In some indirect bandgap semiconductors such as GaP, the recombination of the
electron with a hole at certain recombination centers results in photon emission. The
E–k diagram is similar to that shown in Figure 5.52c except that the recombination

centers at Er are generated by the purposeful addition of nitrogen impurities to GaP.
The electron transition from Er to Ev involves photon emission.

Electron Motion and Drift We can understand the response of a conduction
band electron to an applied external force, for example, an applied field, by examining the E–k diagram. Again, for simplicity, we consider the one-dimensional crystal.
The electron is wandering around the crystal quite randomly due to scattering from
lattice vibrations. Thus the electron moves with a certain k value in the +x direction,
say k+, as illustrated in the E–k diagram of Figure 5.53a. When it is scattered by
a lattice vibration, its k value changes, perhaps to k−, which is also shown in Figure 5.53a. This process of k changing randomly from one scattering to another
scattering process continues all the time, so over a long time the average value of k
is zero; that is, average k+ is the same as average k−.
When an electric field is applied, say in the −x direction, then the electron gains
momentum in the +x direction from the force of the field eEx. With time, while the
electron is not scattered, it moves up in the E–k diagram from k1+ to k2+ to k3+ and
so on until a lattice vibration randomly scatters the electron to say k1− (or to some
other random k value) as shown in Figure 5.53b. Over a long time, the average of
all k+ is no longer equal to the average of all k− and there is a net momentum in the
+x direction, which is tantamount to a drift in the same direction.
Effective Mass The usual definition of inertial mass of a particle in classical
physics is based on

Force = Mass × Acceleration
F = ma

DIRECT AND INDIRECT BANDGAP SEMICONDUCTORS

5 .1 3

When we treat the electron as a wave within the semiconductor crystal, we have to
determine whether we can still, in some way, use the convenient classical F = ma
relation to describe the motion of an electron under an applied force such as eEx
and, if so, what the apparent mass of the electron in the crystal should be.
We will evaluate the velocity and acceleration of the electron in the CB in
response to an electric field Ex along −x that imposes an external force Fext = eEx
in the +x direction, as shown in Figure 5.53b. Our treatment will make use of the
quantum mechanical E–k diagram.
Since we are treating the electron as a wave, we have to evaluate the group
velocity vg, which, by definition, is vg = dω∕dk. We know that the time dependence
of the wavefunction is exp(−jEt∕ħ) where the energy E = ħω (ω is an “angular
frequency” associated with the wave motion of the electron). Both E and ω depend
on k. Thus, the group velocity is
vg =

1 dE
ħ dk

[5.86]

Electron’s
group velocity

Thus the group velocity is determined by the gradient of the E–k curve. In
the presence of an electric field, the electron experiences a force Fext = eEx from
which it gains energy and moves up in the E–k diagram until, later on, it collides
with a lattice vibration, as shown in Figure 5.53b. During a small time interval
δt between collisions, the electron moves a distance vg δt and hence gains energy
δE, which is
δE = Fextvg δt

[5.87]

To find the acceleration of the electron and the effective mass, we somehow
have to put this equation into a form that looks like Fext = mea, where a is the
acceleration. From Equation 5.87, the relationship between the external force and
energy is
Fext =

1 dE

[5.88]

where we used Equation 5.86 for vg in Equation 5.87. Equation 5.88 is the reason
for interpreting ħk as the crystal momentum inasmuch as the rate of change of ħk
is the externally applied force.
The acceleration a is defined as dvg∕dt. We can use Equation 5.86,

SEMICONDUCTORS

We know that the response of a free electron to the external force is Fext = mea,
where me is its mass in vacuum. Therefore, it is quite clear from Equation 5.90 that
the effective mass of the electron in the crystal is
Effective
mass

m*e = ħ2[

d 2E −1
dk2 ]

[5.91]

Thus, the electron responds to an external force and moves as if its mass were
given by Equation 5.91. The effective mass obviously depends on the E–k relationship, which in turn depends on the crystal symmetry and the nature of bonding
between the atoms. Its value is different for electrons in the CB and for those in the
VB, and moreover, it depends on the energy of the electron since it is related to the
curvature of the E–k behavior (d 2E∕dk2). Further, it is clear from Equation 5.91 that
the effective mass is a quantum mechanical quantity inasmuch as the E–k behavior
is a direct consequence of the application of quantum mechanics (the Schrödinger
equation) to the electron in the crystal.
It is interesting that, according to Equation 5.91, when the E–k curve is a downward concave as at the top of a band (e.g., Figure 5.51), the effective mass of an
electron at these energies in a band is then negative. What does a negative effective
mass mean? When the electron moves up on the E–k curve by gaining energy from
the field, it actually decelerates, that is, moves more slowly. Its acceleration is therefore in the opposite direction to an electron at the bottom of the band. Electrons in
the CB are at the bottom of a band, so their effective masses are positive quantities.
At the top of a valence band, however, we have plenty of electrons. These electrons
have negative effective masses and under the action of a field, they decelerate. Put
differently, they accelerate in the opposite direction to the applied external force Fext.
It turns out that we can describe the collective motion of these electrons near the
top of a band by considering the motion of a few holes with positive masses.
It should be mentioned that Equation 5.91 defines the meaning of the effective
mass in quantum mechanical terms. Its usefulness as a concept lies in the fact that
we can measure it experimentally, for example, by cyclotron resonance experiments, and have actual values for it. This means we can simply replace me by m*e
in equations that describe the effect of an external force on electron transport in
semiconductors.

Holes To understand the concept of a hole, we consider the E–k curve corresponding to energies in the VB, as shown in Figure 5.54a. If all the states are filled, then
there are no empty states for the electrons to move into and consequently an electron
cannot gain energy from the field. For each electron moving in the positive x direction with a momentum ħk+, there is a corresponding electron with an equal and
opposite momentum ħk−, so there is no net motion. For example, the electron at b
is moving toward the right with k+b, but its effect is canceled by that at b′ moving
toward the left with k−b′. This cancellation of momenta by electron pairs applies to
all the electrons since the VB is assumed to be full. Thus, a full VB cannot contribute to the electric current.
Suppose that one of the states, labeled as b in Figure 5.54b, near the top of the
valence band has a missing electron, or a hole, because the electron normally at b

Figure 5.54 (a) In a full valence band, there is no net
contribution to the current. There are equal numbers of
electrons (e.g., at b and b′) with opposite momenta. (b) If
there is an empty state (hole) at b at the top of the band,
then the electron at b′ contributes to the current.

has been removed by some means of excitation to the conduction band. It is immediately obvious that the motion of the electron at b′ toward the left, that is, k−b′, is
now not canceled, which means that this electron makes a net contribution to the
current. We realize that the reason the presence of a hole makes conduction possible
is the fact that the momenta of all the VB electrons are canceled except that at b′.
It is also clear that in reaching this conclusion, we had to consider all the electrons
in the valence band.
Let us maintain strict sign rules so that quantities such as the field (Ex), group
velocity (vg), and acceleration (a) along the +x direction are positive and those along
the −x direction are negative. If Ex is along the +x direction, then the acceleration
of a free electron from force/mass is [(−e)(Ex)]∕me, which is negative and along −x
as we expect. Similarly, an electron at the bottom of the CB has a positive effective
mass and an acceleration that is also negative. Our treatment of conduction in metals by electrons in Chapter 2 inherently assumed that electrons accelerated in the
opposite direction to the applied field, that is, positive effective mass.
However, the electrons at the top of the VB have a negative effective mass,
which we can write as −∣m*e ∣. The acceleration a of the electron at b′ contributing
to the current is
a=

−eEx
+eEx
=
−∣m*e ∣ +∣m*e ∣

which is positive, a along Ex. This means that the acceleration of an electron with
a negative effective mass at the top of a VB is equivalent to the acceleration of a
positive charge +e with an effective mass ∣m*e ∣. Put differently, we therefore can
equivalently describe current conduction by the motion of the hole alone by assigning to it a positive charge and a positive effective mass.
“The hole is really an abstraction which gives a convenient way of describing
the behavior of the electrons. The behavior of the holes is essentially a shorthand
way of describing the behavior of all the electrons.” Willian Shockley. (Electrons
and Holes in Semiconductors, Van Nostrand Company Inc., New York, 1950; Sections 7.6

we can surmise that the effective mass of the electron in a metal is the same as the mass in
vacuum. (However, as soon as we introduce a periodic PE variation inside a crystal as in
Figure 5.50, in general, the effective mass is not the same as the mass in vacuum.)
EXAMPLE 5.27

CURRENT DUE TO A MISSING ELECTRON IN THE VB First, let us consider a completely
full valence band that contains, say, N electrons. N∕2 of these are moving with momentum
in the +x, and N∕2 in the −x direction. Suppose that the crystal is unit volume. An electron
with charge −e moving with a group velocity vgi contributes to the current by an amount −evgi.
We can determine the current density JN due to the motion of all the electrons (N of them)
in the band,
N

JN = −e ∑ vgi = 0
i=1

JN is zero because for each value of vgi, there is a corresponding velocity equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (b and b′ in Figure 5.54a). Our conclusion from this is that
the contribution to the current density from a full valence band is nil, as we expect.
Suppose now that the jth electron is missing (b in Figure 5.54b). The net current density
is due to N − 1 electrons in the band, so
N

JN−1 = −e ∑ vgi

[5.92]

i=1,i≠j

where the summation is for i = 1 to N and i ≠ j ( jth electron is missing). We can write the sum
as summation to N including the jth electron and minus the missing jth electron contribution,
N

JN−1 = −e ∑ vgi − (−evg j )
i=1

that is,
JN−1 = +evgj

[5.93]

where we used JN = 0. We see that when there is a missing electron, there is a net current
due to that empty state ( jth). The current appears as the motion of a charge +e with a velocity
vgj, where vg j is the group velocity of the missing electron. In other words, the current is due
to the motion of a positive charge +e at the site of the missing electron at kj, which is what

5 .1 5

we call a hole. One should note that Equation 5.92 describes the current by considering the
motions of all the N − 1 electrons, whereas Equation 5.93 describes the same current by
simply considering the missing electron as if it were a positively charged particle (+e) moving with a velocity equal to that of the missing electron. Equation 5.93 is the convenient
description universally adopted for a valence band containing missing electrons.

5.14

INDIRECT RECOMBINATION

We consider the recombination of minority carriers in an extrinsic indirect bandgap
semiconductor such as Si or Ge. As an example, we consider the recombination of
electrons in a p-type semiconductor. In an indirect bandgap semiconductor, the
recombination mechanism involves a recombination center, a third body that may be
a crystal defect or an impurity, in the recombination process to satisfy the requirements of conservation of momentum. We can view the recombination process as
follows. Recombination occurs when an electron is captured by the recombination
center at the energy level Er. As soon as the electron is captured, it will recombine
with a hole because holes are abundant in a p-type semiconductor. In other words,
since there are many majority carriers, the limitation on the rate of recombination
is the actual capture of the minority carrier by the center. Thus, if τe is the electron
recombination time, since the electrons will have to be captured by the centers, τe
is given by
τe =

1
Sr Nrvth

[5.94]

where Sr is the capture (or recombination) cross section of the center, Nr is the
concentration of centers, and vth is the mean speed of the electron that you may take
as its effective thermal velocity.
Equation 5.94 is valid under small injection conditions, that is, ppo ≫ np. There
is a more general treatment of indirect recombination called the Shockley–Read–Hall
statistics of indirect recombination and generation, which is treated in more advanced
semiconductor physics textbooks. That theory eventually arrives at Equation 5.94 for
low-level injection conditions. We derived Equation 5.94 from a purely physical
reasoning.
Gold, for example, is sometimes added to silicon to aid recombination in fast
switching devices. It is found that the minority carrier recombination time is inversely
proportional to the gold concentration, following Equation 5.94.

5.15

AMORPHOUS SEMICONDUCTORS

Up to now we have been dealing with crystalline semiconductors, those crystals that
have perfect periodicity and are practically flawless unless purposefully doped for
use in device applications. They are used in numerous solid-state devices including
large-area solar cells. Today’s microprocessor uses a single crystal of silicon that contains several billion transistors. There are, however, various applications in electronics

505

506

CHAPTER 5

∙

SEMICONDUCTORS

that require inexpensive large-area devices to be fabricated and hence require a semiconductor material that can be prepared in a large area. In other applications, the
semiconductor material is required to be deposited as a film on a flexible substrate
for use as a sensor. Best known examples of large-area devices are flat panel displays
based on thin-film transistors (TFTs), inexpensive solar cells, photoconductor drums
(for printing and photocopying), image sensors, and newly developed X-ray image
detectors. Many of these applications typically use hydrogenated amorphous silicon,
a-Si:H.
A distinctive property of an electron in a crystalline solid is that its wavefunction
is a traveling wave, a Bloch wave, ψk, as in Equation 5.85. The Bloch wavefunction
is a consequence of the periodicity of an electron’s potential energy PE, V(x), within
the crystal. One can view the electron’s motion as tunneling through the periodic
potential energy hills. The wavefunctions ψk form extended states because they
extend throughout the whole crystal. The electron belongs to the whole crystal, and
there is an equal probability of finding an electron in any unit cell. The wavevector
k in this traveling wave ψk acts as a quantum number. There are many discrete kn
values, which form a nearly continuous set of k values (see Figure 5.51). We can
describe the interaction of the electron with an external force, or with photons and
phonons, by assigning a momentum ħk to the electron, which is called the electron’s
crystal momentum. The electron’s wavefunction ψk is frequently scattered by lattice
vibrations (or by defects or impurities) from one k-value to another, e.g., from ψk to
ψk′. The scattering of the wavefunction imposes a mean free path ℓ on the electron’s
motion, that is, a mean distance over which a wave can travel without being scattering. Over the distance ℓ, the wavefunction is coherent, that is, well defined and
predictable as a traveling Bloch wave; ℓ is also known as the coherence length of
the wavefunction. The mobility is determined by the mean free path ℓ, which at room
temperature is typically of the order of several hundreds of mean interatomic separations. The crystal periodicity and the unit cell atomic structure control the types of
Bloch wave solutions one can obtain to the Schrödinger equation. The solutions allow
the electron energy E to be examined as a function of k (or momentum ħk) and these
E − k diagrams categorize crystalline semiconductors into two classes: direct bandgap (GaAs type) and indirect bandgap (Si type) semiconductors.
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is the noncrystalline form of silicon
in which the structure has no long-range order but only short-range order; that is,
we can only identify the nearest neighbors of a given atom. Each Si atom has four
neighbors as in the crystal, but there is no periodicity or long-range order as illustrated in Figure 1.61. Without the hydrogen, pure a-Si would have dangling bonds.
In such a structure sometimes a Si atom would not be able to find a fourth neighboring Si atom to bond with and will be left with a dangling bond as in Figure 1.61b.
The hydrogen in the structure (∼10 percent) passivates (i.e., neutralizes) the unsatisfied (“dangling”) bonds inherent in a noncrystalline structure and so reduces the
density of dangling bonds or defects. a-Si:H belongs to a class of solids called
amorphous semiconductors that do not follow typical crystalline concepts such as
Bloch wavefunctions. First, due to the lack of periodicity, we cannot describe the
electron as a Bloch wave. Consequently, we cannot use a wavevector k, and hence ħk,
to describe the electron’s motion. These semiconductors however do have a short-range

order and also possess an energy bandgap that separates a conduction band and a
valence band. A window glass has a noncrystalline structure but also has a bandgap,
which makes it transparent. Photons with energies less than the bandgap energy can
pass through the window glass.
The examination of the structure of a-Si:H in Figure 1.61c should make it apparent that the potential energy V(x) of the electron in this noncrystalline structure
fluctuates randomly from site to site. In some cases, the local changes in V(x) can
be quite strong, forming effective local PE wells (obviously finite wells). Such fluctuations in the PE within the solid can capture or trap electrons, that is, localize
electrons at certain spatial locations. A localized electron will have a wavefunction
that resembles the wavefunction in the hydrogen atom, so the probability of finding
the electron is localized to the site. Such locations that can trap electrons, give them
localized wavefunctions, are called localized states. The amorphous structure also
has electrons that possess extended wavefunctions; that is, they belong to the whole
solid. These extended wavefunctions are distinctly different than those in the crystal
because they have very short coherence lengths due to the random potential fluctuations; the electron is scattered from site to site and hence the mean free path is
of the order of a few atomic spacings. The extended wavefunction has random phase
fluctuations. Figure 5.55 compares localized and extended wavefunctions in an amorphous semiconductor.
Electronic properties of all amorphous semiconductors can be explained in terms
of the energy distribution of their density of states (DOS) function, g(E). The DOS
function has well-defined energies Ev and Ec that separate extended states from localized states as in Figure 5.55. There is a distribution of localized states, called tail
states below Ec and above Ev. The usual bandgap Ec − Ev is called the mobility
gap. The reason is that there is a change in the character of charge transport, and
hence in the carrier mobility, in going from extended states above Ec to localized
states below Ec.

508

CHAPTER 5

∙

SEMICONDUCTORS

Electron transport above Ec in the conduction band is dominated by scattering
from random potential fluctuations arising from the disordered nature of the structure. The electrons are scattered so frequently that their effective mobility is much
less than what it is in crystalline Si: μe in a-Si:H is typically 5–10 cm2 V−1 s−1
whereas it is 1400 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a single crystal Si. Electron transport below Ec,
on the other hand, requires an electron to jump, or hop, from one localized state to
another, aided by thermal vibrations of the lattice, in an analogous way to the diffusion of an interstitial impurity in a crystal. We know from Chapter 1 that the jump
or diffusion of the impurity is a thermally activated process because it relies on the
thermal vibrations of all the crystal atoms to occasionally give the impurity enough
energy to make that jump. The electron’s mobility associated with this type of hopping motion among localized states is thermally activated, and its value is small.
Thus, there is a change in the electron mobility across Ec, which is called the conduction band mobility edge.
The localized states (frequently simply called traps) between Ev and Ec have a
profound effect on the overall electronic properties. The tail localized states are a
direct result of the structural disorder that is inherent in noncrystalline solids, variations in the bond angles and length. Various prominent peaks and features in the
DOS within the mobility gap have been associated with possible structural defects,
such as under- and overcoordinated atoms in the structure, dangling bonds, and dopants. Electrons that drift in the conduction band can fall into localized states and
become immobilized (trapped) for a while. Thus, electron transport in a-Si:H occurs
by multiple trapping in shallow localized states. The effective electron drift mobility
in a-Si:H is therefore reduced to ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Low drift mobilities obviously
prevent the use of amorphous semiconductor materials in high-speed or high-gain
electronic applications. Nonetheless, low-speed electronics is just as important as
high-speed electronics in the electronics market in such applications as flat panel
displays, solar cells, and image sensors. A low-speed flat panel display made from
hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs costs very roughly the same as a
high-speed crystalline Si microchip that runs the CPU.

DEFINING TERMS
Acceptor atoms are dopants that have one less valency
than the host atom. They therefore accept electrons
from the VB and thereby create holes in the VB, which
leads to a p > n and hence to a p-type semiconductor.
Average energy of an electron in the CB is 32 kT as if the
electrons were obeying Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.
This is only true for a nondegenerate semiconductor.
Bloch wave refers to an electron wavefunction of the
form ψk = Uk(x) exp(jkx), which is a traveling wave
that is modulated by a function Uk(x) that has the periodicity of the crystal. The Bloch wavefunction is a

consequence of the periodicity of an electron’s potential energy within the crystal.
Compensated semiconductor contains both donors
and acceptors in the same crystal region that compensate for each other’s effects. For example, if there are
more donors than acceptors, Nd > Na, then some of the
electrons released by donors are captured by acceptors
and the net effect is that Nd − Na number of electrons
per unit volume are left in the CB.
Conduction band (CB) is a band of energies for the

from an applied field and drift and thereby contribute
to electrical conduction. The electron in the CB behaves as if it were a “free” particle with an effective
mass m*e .
Degenerate semiconductor has so many dopants that
the electron concentration in the CB, or hole concentration in the VB, is comparable with the density of
states in the band. Consequently, the Pauli exclusion
principle is significant and Fermi–Dirac statistics
must be used. The Fermi level is either in the CB for a
n+-type degenerate or in the VB for a p+-type degenerate
semiconductor. The superscript + indicates a heavily
doped semiconductor.

(ħk)2∕m*e where ħk is the momentum and m*e is the effective mass of the electron, which is determined from
the E–k behavior.
Excess carrier concentration is the excess concentration above the thermal equilibrium value. Excess
carriers are generated by an external excitation such as
photogeneration.

Donor atoms are dopants that have a valency one more
than the host atom. They therefore donate electrons to
the CB and thereby create electrons in the CB, which
leads to n > p and hence to an n-type semiconductor.

Extended state refers to an electron wavefunction ψk
whose magnitude does not decay with distance; that is,
it is extended in the crystal. An extended wavefunction
of an electron in a crystal is a Bloch wave, that is,
ψk = Uk(x) exp( jkx), which is a traveling wave that is
modulated by a function Uk(x) that has the periodicity
of the crystal. There is an equal probability of finding
an electron in any unit cell of the crystal. Scattering of
an electron in the crystal by lattice vibrations or impurities, etc., corresponds to the electron being scattered
from one ψk to another ψk′, i.e., a change in the wavevector from k to k′. Valence and conduction bands in a
crystal have extended states.

Effective density of states (Nc) at the CB edge is a
quantity that represents all the states in the CB per unit
volume as if they were all at Ec. Similarly, Nv at the VB
edge is quantity that represents all the states in the VB
per unit volume as if they were all at Ev.

Extrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor that has
been doped so that the concentration of one type of
charge carrier far exceeds that of the other. Adding donor impurities releases electrons into the CB and n far
exceeds p; thus, the semiconductor becomes n-type.

Diffusion is a random process by which particles move
from high-concentration regions to low-concentration
regions.

Effective mass (m*e ) of an electron is a quantum mechanical quantity that behaves like the inertial mass in
classical mechanics, F = ma, in that it measures the
object’s inertial resistance to acceleration. It relates the
acceleration a of an electron in a crystal to the applied
external force Fext by Fext = m*e a. The external force is
most commonly the force of an electric field eE and
excludes all internal forces within the crystal.
Einstein relation relates the diffusion coefficient D
and the drift mobility μ of a given species of charge
carriers through (D∕μ) = (kT∕e).
Electron affinity ( χ) is the energy required to remove
an electron from Ec to the vacuum level.
Energy of the electron in the crystal, whether in the
CB or VB, depends on its momentum ħk through the
E–k behavior determined by the Schrödinger equation. E–k behavior is most conveniently represented
graphically through E–k diagrams. For example, for an
electron at the bottom of the CB, E increases as

Fermi energy or level (EF) may be defined in several
equivalent ways. The Fermi level is the energy level
corresponding to the energy required to remove an
electron from the semiconductor; there need not be any
actual electrons at this energy level. The energy needed
to remove an electron defines the work function Φ. We
can define the Fermi level to be Φ below the vacuum
level. EF can also be defined as that energy value below
which all states are full and above which all states are
empty at absolute zero of temperature. EF can also be
defined through a difference. A difference in the Fermi
energy ΔEF in a system is the external electrical work
done per electron either on the system or by the system
such as electrical work done when a charge e moves
through an electrostatic PE difference is eΔV. It can be
viewed as a fundamental material property.
Intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) is the electron
concentration in the CB of an intrinsic semiconductor.
The hole concentration in the VB is equal to the electron concentration.

SEMICONDUCTORS

Intrinsic semiconductor has an equal number of
electrons and holes due to thermal generation across
the bandgap Eg. It corresponds to a pure semiconductor crystal in which there are no impurities or crystal
defects.
Ionization energy is the energy required to ionize an
atom, for example, to remove an electron.
Ionized impurity scattering limited mobility is the
mobility of the electrons when their motion is limited
by scattering from the ionized impurities in the semiconductor (e.g., donors and acceptors).
k is the wavevector of the electron’s wavefunction. In
a crystal the electron wavefunction, ψk(x) is a modulated
traveling wave of the form
ψk(x) = Uk(x) exp( jkx)
where k is the wavevector and Uk(x) is a periodic function that depends on the PE of interaction between the
electron and the lattice atoms. k identifies all possible
states ψk(x) that are allowed to exist in the crystal. ħk is
called the crystal momentum of the electron as its rate
of change is the externally applied force to the electron,
d(ħk)∕dt = Fexternal.
Lattice-scattering-limited mobility is the mobility
of the electrons when their motion is limited by scattering from thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms.
Localized state refers to an electron wavefunction
ψlocalized whose magnitude, or the envelope of the wavefunction, decays with distance, which localizes the
electron to a spatial region in the semiconductor. For
example, a 1s-type wavefunction of the form ψlocalized ∝
exp(−αr), where r is the distance measured from some
center at r = 0, and α is a positive constant, would represent a localized state centered at r = 0.
Majority carriers are electrons in an n-type and holes
in a p-type semiconductor.
Mass action law in semiconductor science refers to
the law np = n2i , which is valid under thermal equilibrium conditions and in the absence of external biases
and illumination.
Minority carrier diffusion length (L) is the mean
distance a minority carrier diffuses before recombination, L = √Dτ, where D is the diffusion coefficient
and τ is the minority carrier lifetime.

Minority carrier lifetime (τ) is the mean time for a
minority carrier to disappear by recombination. 1∕τ is
the mean probability per unit time that a minority carrier recombines with a majority carrier.
Minority carriers are electrons in a p-type and holes
in an n-type semiconductor.
Nondegenerate semiconductor has electrons in the
CB and holes in the VB that obey Boltzmann statistics.
Put differently, the electron concentration n in the CB
is much less than the effective density of states Nc and
similarly p ≪ Nv. It refers to a semiconductor that has
not been heavily doped so that these conditions are
maintained; typically, doping concentrations are less
than 1018 cm−3.
Ohmic contact is a contact that can supply charge
carriers to a semiconductor at a rate determined by
charge transport through the semiconductor and not by
the contact properties itself. Thus the current is limited
by the conductivity of the semiconductor and not by
the contact.
Peltier effect is the phenomenon of heat absorption or
liberation at the contact between two dissimilar materials as a result of a dc current passing through the junction. The rate of heat generation Q′ is proportional to
the dc current I passing through the contact so that
Q′ = +Π I, where Π is called the Peltier coefficient
and the sign depends on whether heat is absorbed or
released.
Phonon is a quantum of energy associated with the
vibrations of the atoms in the crystal, analogous to
the photon. A phonon has an energy ħω where ω is the
frequency of the lattice vibration.
Photoconductivity is the change in the conductivity
from dark to light, σlight − σdark.
Photogeneration is the excitation of an electron into
the CB by the absorption of a photon. If the photon is
absorbed by an electron in the VB, then its excitation to
the CB will generate an EHP.
Photoinjection is the photogeneration of carriers in
the semiconductor by illumination. Photogeneration
may be VB to CB excitation, in which case electrons
and holes are generated in pairs.
Piezoresistivity is the change in the resistivity of a
semiconductor due to an applied mechanical stress σm.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Elastoresistivity refers to the change in the resistivity
due to an induced strain in the substance. Application
of stress normally leads to strain, so piezoresistivity
and elastoresistivity refer to the same phenomenon. In
simple terms, the change in the resistivity may be due
to a change in the concentration of carriers or due to a
change in the drift mobility of the carriers. The fractional change in the resistivity δρ∕ρ is proportional to
the applied stress σm, and the proportionality constant
is called the piezoresistive coefficient π (1/Pa units),
which is a tensor quantity because a stress in one direction in a crystal can alter the resistivity in another
direction.
Recombination of an electron–hole pair involves
an electron in the CB falling down in energy into an
empty state (hole) in the VB to occupy it. The result is
the annihilation of an EHP. Recombination is direct
when the electron falls directly down into an empty
state in the VB as in GaAs. Recombination is indirect
if the electron is first captured locally by a defect or an
impurity, called a recombination center, and from there
it falls down into an empty state (hole) in the VB as in
Si and Ge.
Schottky junction is a contact between a metal and a
semiconductor that has rectifying properties. For a
metal/n-type semiconductor junction, electrons on the
metal side have to overcome a potential energy barrier
ΦB to enter the conduction band of the semiconductor,
whereas the conduction electrons in the semiconductor
have to overcome a smaller barrier eVo to enter the
metal. Forward bias decreases eVo and thereby greatly

encourages electron emissions over the barrier e(Vo − V).
Under reverse bias, electrons have to overcome ΦB and
the current is very small.
Thermal equilibrium carrier concentrations are
those electron and hole concentrations that are solely
determined by the statistics of the carriers and the density of states in the band. Thermal equilibrium concentrations obey the mass action law, np = n2i .
Thermal velocity (vth) of an electron in the CB is its
mean (or effective) speed in the semiconductor as it
moves around in the crystal. For a nondegenerate semiconductor, it can be obtained simply from 12 m*e v 2th = 23 kT.
Vacuum level is the energy level where the PE of the
electron and the KE of the electron are both zero. It
defines the energy level where the electron is just free
from the solid.
Valence band (VB) is a band of energies for the electrons in bonds in a semiconductor. The valence band is
made of all those states (wavefunctions) that constitute
the bonding between the atoms in the crystal. At absolute zero of temperature, the VB is full of all the bonding electrons of the atoms. When an electron is excited
to the CB, this leaves behind an empty state, which is
called a hole. It carries a positive charge and behaves
as if it were a “free” positively charged entity with an
effective mass of m*h . It moves around the VB by having
a neighboring electron tunnel into the unoccupied
state.
Work function (Φ) is the energy required to remove
an electron from the solid to the vacuum level.

the Hall voltage should be zero, which is achieved by using a potentiometer between 2 and 3 so that
the voltage difference between 5 and 6 can be set to zero before the application of Bz. (The potentiometer places point 6 electrically opposite point 5.) When Bz is applied, V65 gives the Hall voltage
VH and is measured using a voltmeter with a high input resistance. For an n-type semiconductor V65
is negative (6 is negative with respect to 5). Show that the Hall coefficient is given by

Consider an n-type Si doped with 1014 donor cm−3 (Nd). Calculate the Hall voltage if t = 500 μm,
the magnetic field is 0.01 T and the current is 0.1 mA. What is the voltage drop between 1 and 4 if
l = 5 mm and w = 2 mm and what is the power dissipated in the semiconductor? Is there any advantage
in increasing the dopant concentration to reduce the voltage drop and power dissipated in the sample?

Hall effect in semiconductors The Hall effect in a semiconductor sample involves not only the
electron and hole concentrations n and p, respectively, but also the electron and hole drift mobilities
μe and μh. The Hall coefficient of a semiconductor is (see Chapter 2)

where b = μe∕μh.
a. Given the mass action law np = n2i, find n for maximum ∣RH∣ (negative and positive RH). Assume
that the drift mobilities remain relatively unaffected as n changes (due to doping). Given the
electron and hole drift mobilities μe = 1400 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 450 cm2 V−1 s−1 for silicon,
determine n for maximum ∣RH∣ in terms of ni. Find the maximum magnitude of RH.
b. Taking b = 3.1, plot RH as a function of electron concentration n∕ni from 0.01 to 10.
c. Show that, when n ≫ ni, RH = −1∕en and when n ≪ ni, RH = +1∕ep.

Hall effect in semiconductors Most Hall-effect high-sensitivity sensors typically use III–V semiconductors, such as GaAs, InAs, InSb. Hall-effect integrated circuits with integrated amplifiers, on
the other hand, use Si. Consider nearly intrinsic samples in which n ≈ p ≈ ni, and calculate RH for
each using the data in Table 5.5. What is your conclusion? Which sensor would exhibit the worst
temperature drift? (Consider the bandgap, and drift in ni.)

Compound semiconductor devices Silicon and germanium crystalline semiconductors are what are
called elemental Group IV semiconductors. It is possible to have compound semiconductors from
atoms in Groups III and V. For example, GaAs is a compound semiconductor that has Ga from Group
III and As from Group V, so in the crystalline structure we have an “effective” or “mean” valency
of IV per atom and the solid behaves like a semiconductor. Similarly GaSb (gallium antimonide)
would be a III–V type semiconductor. Provided we have a stoichiometric compound, the semiconductor will be ideally intrinsic. If, however, there is an excess of Sb atoms in the solid GaSb, then we
will have nonstoichiometry and the semiconductor will be extrinsic. In this case, excess Sb atoms will
act as donors in the GaSb structure. There are many useful compound semiconductors, the most
important of which is GaAs. Some can be doped both n- and p-type, but many are one type only.
For example, ZnO is a II–VI compound semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 3.2 eV, but unfortunately, due to the presence of excess Zn, it is naturally n-type and cannot be doped to p-type.
a. GaSb (gallium antimonide) is an interesting direct bandgap semiconductor with an energy bandgap Eg = 0.67 eV, almost equal to that of germanium. It can be used as a light emitting diode
(LED) or laser diode material. What would be the wavelength of emission from a GaSb LED?
Will this be visible?
b. Calculate the intrinsic conductivity of GaSb at 300 K taking Nc = 2.3 × 1019 cm−3, Nv =
6.1 × 1019 cm−3, μe = 5000 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh = 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compare with the intrinsic conductivity of Ge.
c. Excess Sb atoms will make gallium antimonide nonstoichiometric, that is, GaSb1+δ, which will result
in an extrinsic semiconductor. Given that the density of GaSb is 5.4 g cm−3, calculate δ (excess
Sb) that will result in GaSb having a conductivity of 100 Ω−1 cm−1. Will this be an n- or p-type
semiconductor? You may assume that the drift mobilities are relatively unaffected by the doping.

Direct recombination and GaAs Consider recombination in a direct bandgap p-type semiconductor, e.g., GaAs doped with an acceptor concentration Na. The recombination involves a direct meeting
of an electron–hole pair as depicted in Figure 5.22. Suppose that excess electrons and holes have been
injected (e.g., by photoexcitation), and that Δnp is the excess electron concentration and Δpp is the
excess hole concentration. Assume Δnp is controlled by recombination and thermal generation only;
that is, recombination is the equilibrium storing mechanism. The recombination rate will be proportional to nppp, and the thermal generation rate will be proportional to npoppo. In the dark, in equilibrium, thermal generation rate is equal to the recombination rate. The latter is proportional to nnoppo.

A photoconductive film of n-type GaAs doped with 1013 cm−3 donors is 2 mm long (L), 1 mm
wide (W), and 5 μm thick (D). The sample has electrodes attached to its ends (electrode area
is therefore 1 mm × 5 μm) which are connected to a 1 V supply through an ammeter. The
GaAs photoconductor is uniformly illuminated over the surface area 2 mm × 1 mm with a 1 mW
laser radiation of wavelength λ = 840 nm (infrared). The recombination coefficient B for GaAs
is 7.21 × 10−16 m3 s−1. At λ = 840 nm, the absorption coefficient is about 5 × 103 cm−1. The
internal quantum efficiency is the number of electron and hole pairs photogenerated per absorbed
photon. Assume that this is unity. Calculate the photocurrent Iphoto and the electrical power dissipated as Joule heating in the sample. What will be the power dissipated as heat in the sample

Piezoresistive strain gauge factor Piezoresistive coefficients for an n-type Si along [110] are πL =
−31.2 × 10−11 Pa−1, and πT = −17.6 × 10−11 Pa−1 whereas for p-type Si along the same crystal direction, πL = 71.8 × 10−11 Pa−1, and πT = −66.3 × 10−11 Pa−1. Given the elastic modulus Y ≈ 170 GPa,
calculate the gauge factors for these n-type and p-type Si piezoresistors. What is your conclusion?

5.33

Piezoresistivity application to deflection and force measurement Consider the cantilever in
Figure 5.39c. Suppose we apply a force F to the free end, which results in a deflection h of the tip
of the cantilever from its horizontal equilibrium position. The maximum stress σm is induced at the
support end of the cantilever, at its surface where the piezoresistor is embedded to measure the stress.
When the cantilever is bent, there is a tensile or longitudinal stress σL on the surface because the top
surface is extended and the bottom surface is contracted. If L, W, and D are, respectively, the length,
width, and thickness of the cantilever (see Figure 5.39c), then the relationships between the force F
and deflection h and the maximum stress σL are

change in the resistance, ΔR∕R, of the piezoresistor when the deflection is 0.1 μm. What is the force

design choice for the length L of the cantilever depend on whether one is interested in measuring the
deflection h or the force F? (Note: σL depends on the distance x from the support end; it decreases
with x. Assume that the length of the piezoresistor is very short compared with L so that σL does not
change significantly along its length.)

in which η is called the ideality factor,16 and is unity for an ideal Schottky junction. The derivation
leading to Equation 5.68 for an ideal Schottky junction under forward bias assumes that electrons

external current bringing electrons. But, if electrons are lost by recombination during diffusion, then
the external current will also have to replenish those recombined electrons, not only those that diffuse
over to the metal. A Schottky contact to a semiconductor as shown in Figure 5.58 has a neutral
semiconductor region, which has a certain bulk resistance Rs. In modeling a practical Schottky diode
we need to include Rs in series with a Schottky junction. The actual voltage across the junction is
then the voltage across V across the whole diode minus the voltage drop across Rs so that the I–V

Peltier coolers and figure of merit (FOM) Consider the thermoelectric effect shown in Figure 5.46
in which a semiconductor has two contacts at its ends and is conducting an electric current I. We
assume that the cold junction is at a temperature Tc and the hot junction is at Th and that there is a
temperature difference of ΔT = Th − Tc between the two ends of the semiconductor. The current I
flowing through the cold junction absorbs Peltier heat at a rate Q′P, given by
Q′P = ΠI

[5.113]

Where Π is the Peltier coefficient for the junction between the metal and semiconductor. The current
I flowing through the semiconductor generates heat due to the Joule heating of the semiconductor.
The rate of Joule heat generated through the bulk of the semiconductor is
Q′J = (

L
I2
σA )

[5.114]

We assume that half of this heat flows to the cold junction.
In addition there is heat flow from the hot to the cold junction through the semiconductor, given
by the thermal conduction equation
Q′TC = (

[5.115]

The net rate of heat absorption (cooling rate) at the cold junction is then
Q′net = Q′P −

By substituting from Equations 5.113 to 5.115 into Equation 5.116, obtain the net cooling rate in

Photogeneration and carrier kinetic energies Figure 5.36 shows what happens when a photon
with energy hf > Eg is absorbed in GaAs to photogenerate an electron and a hole. The figure shows
that the electron has a higher kinetic energy (KE ), which is the excess energy above Ec than the hole,
since the hole is almost at Ev The reason is that the electron effective mass in GaAs is almost 10
times less than the hole effective mass, so the photogenerated electron has a much higher KE. When
an electron and hole are photogenerated in a direct bandgap semiconductor, they have the same k
vector. Energy conservation requires that the photon energy hf divides according to

The Four Probe Resistivity Measurement The four probe resistivity measurement allows the resistivity of a semiconductor crystal to be conveniently measured without complications arising from
contacts effects and without the need for samples of known geometry. It is widely used in the semiconductor industry to measure the resistivity of Si wafers. The technique is illustrated in Figure 5.59a.
Four collinear and equally separated sharp probes (needles) are placed on the surface of the sample.
The probes are spring pressured to make good contact. A current I is passed through the sample via
the outer probes A and D. The applied voltage to A and D is not relevant to the measurement as long
as a known current is passed through the sample. Indeed, the contacts at A and D may be Schottky
contacts and the current may be limited by the Schottky junctions. The voltage drop between the two
inner probes B and C are read with a digital voltmeter which takes a negligible input current. Thus,
the current paths in the semiconductor and also the voltage drop along BC are not upset by the voltmeter connected between B and C. Within the semiconductor, the current I and voltage drop along
the current between B and C, that is VBC, are related by the resistivity of the semiconductor and some
geometric factor taking into account various possible current paths from A to D and the locations of
the points B and C. At any point in the sample where the current density is J and the electric field
is E, we must have J = E∕ρ. Consider point A as an independent point current source and point D as
an independent point current sink. We can find the potential drop between BC for the two independent
currents and then add them up.
Suppose that the sample dimensions are much larger than the separation s of the needles. Consider
the currents emanating from point A as shown in Figure 5.59b. Current density at radius r is
J=

The surface area through which current flows is half of 4πr 2 because current flows only below

Semiconductor Devices

Most diodes are essentially pn junctions fabricated by forming a contact between a

p-type and an n-type semiconductor. The junction possesses rectifying properties in
that a current in one direction can flow quite easily whereas in the other direction
it is limited by a leakage current that is generally very small. A transistor is a threeterminal solid-state device in which a current flowing between two electrodes is
controlled by the voltage between the third and one of the other terminals. Transistors are capable of providing current and voltage gains thereby enabling weak signals
to be amplified. Transistors can also be used as switches just like electromagnetic
relays. Indeed, the whole microcomputer industry is based on transistor switches.
The majority of the transistors in microelectronics are of essentially two types: bipolar
junction transistors (BJTs) and field effect transistors (FETs). The appreciation of
the underlying principles of the pn junction is essential to understanding the operation of not only the bipolar transistor but also a variety of related devices. The
central fundamental concept is the minority carrier injection as purported by William
Shockley in his explanations of the transistor operation. Field effect transistors operate
on a totally different principle than BJTs. Their characteristics arise from the effect
of the applied field on a conducting channel between two terminals. The last two
decades have seen enormous advances and developments in optoelectronic and photonic devices which we now take for granted, the best examples being light emitting
diodes (LEDs), semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, and solar cells. Nearly all
these devices are based on pn junction principles. The present chapter takes the
semiconductor concepts developed in Chapter 5 to device level applications, from
the basic pn junction to heterojunction laser diodes.

IDEAL pn JUNCTION

6.1.1 NO APPLIED BIAS: OPEN CIRCUIT
Consider what happens when one side of a sample of Si is doped n-type and the
other p-type, as shown in Figure 6.1a. We assume that there is an abrupt discontinuity between the p- and n-regions, which we call the metallurgical junction and label
as M in Figure 6.1a, where the fixed (immobile) ionized donors and the free electrons
(in the conduction band, CB) in the n-region and fixed ionized acceptors and holes
(in the valence band, VB) in the p-region are also shown.

IDEAL pn JUNCTION

Due to the hole concentration gradient from the p-side, where p = ppo, to
the n-side, where p = pno, holes diffuse toward the right. Similarly the electron
concentration gradient drives the electrons by diffusion toward the left. Holes diffusing and entering the n-side recombine with the electrons in the n-side near the
junction. Similarly, electrons diffusing and entering the p-side recombine with holes
in the p-side near the junction. The junction region consequently becomes depleted
of free carriers in comparison with the bulk p- and n-regions far away from the
junction. Note that we must, under equilibrium conditions (e.g., no applied bias or
photoexcitation), have pn = n2i everywhere. Electrons leaving the n-side near the
junction M leave behind exposed positively charged donor ions, say As+, of concentration Nd. Similarly, holes leaving the p-region near M expose negatively charged
acceptor ions, say B−, of concentration Na. There is therefore a space charge layer
(SCL) around M. Figure 6.1b shows the depletion region, or the space charge layer,
around M, whereas Figure 6.1c illustrates the hole and electron concentration profiles in which the vertical concentration scale is logarithmic. Notice that the depletion region in Figure 6.1c has been depleted of its normal concentration of carriers,
which exposes the donor and acceptor ions. The carrier concentrations are not
zero. The depletion region is also called the depletion layer or, less commonly, the
transition region.
It is clear that there is an internal electric field Eo from positive ions to negative
ions, that is, in the −x direction, that tries to drift the holes back into the p-region
and electrons back into the n-region. This field drives the holes in the opposite
direction to their diffusion. As shown in Figure 6.1b, Eo imposes a drift force on
holes in the −x direction, whereas the hole diffusion flux is in the +x direction. A
similar situation also applies for electrons with the electric field attempting to drift
the electrons against diffusion from the n-region to the p-region. It is apparent that
as more and more holes diffuse toward the right, and electrons toward the left, the
internal field around M will increase until eventually an “equilibrium” is reached
when the rate of holes diffusing toward the right is just balanced by holes drifting
back to the left, driven by the field Eo. The electron diffusion and drift fluxes will
also be balanced in equilibrium.
For uniformly doped p- and n-regions, the net space charge density ρnet(x) across
the semiconductor will be as shown in Figure 6.1d. (Why are the edges rounded?)
The net space charge density ρnet is negative and equal to −eNa in the SCL from
x = −Wp to x = 0 (where we take M to be) and then positive and equal to +eNd
from x = 0 to Wn. The total charge on the left-hand side must be equal to that on
the right-hand side for overall charge neutrality, so
NaWp = NdWn

[6.1]

In Figure 6.1, we arbitrarily assumed that the donor concentration is less than
the acceptor concentration, Nd < Na. From Equation 6.1 this implies that Wn > Wp;
that is, the depletion region penetrates the n-side, the lightly doped side, more than
the p-side, the heavily doped side. Indeed, if Na ≫ Nd, then the depletion region is
almost entirely on the n-side. We generally indicate heavily doped regions with the
plus sign as a superscript, that is, p+.

The variation of the electric field across the pn junction is shown in Figure 6.1e.
The negative field means that it is in the −x direction. Note that E(x) reaches a
maximum value Eo at the metallurgical junction M.
The potential V(x) at any point x can be found by integrating the electric field
since by definition E = −dV∕dx. Taking the potential on the p-side far away from
M as zero (we have no applied voltage), which is an arbitrary reference level, then
V(x) increases in the depletion region toward the n-side, as indicated in Figure 6.1f.
Its functional form can be determined by integrating Equation 6.2, which is, of
course, a parabola. Notice that on the n-side the potential reaches Vo, which is called
the built-in potential.
The fact that we are considering an abrupt pn junction means that ρnet(x) can
simply be described by step functions, as displayed in Figure 6.1d. Using the step
form of ρnet(x) in Figure 6.1d in the integration of Equation 6.2 gives the electric
field at M as

where Wo = Wn + Wp is the total width of the depletion region under a zero
applied voltage. If we know Wo, then Wn or Wp follows readily from Equation 6.1.
Equation 6.4 is a relationship between the built-in voltage Vo and the depletion region
width Wo. If we know Vo, we can calculate Wo.
The simplest way to relate Vo to the doping parameters is to make use of the
fact that in the system consisting of p- and n-type semiconductors joined together,

This is called Gauss’s law in point form and comes from Gauss’s law in electrostatics. Gauss’s law is discussed
in Section 7.5.

where E = qV, where q is the charge of the carrier. Considering electrons (q = −e),

and E = −eVo on the n-side away from M where n = nno. Thus

Clearly Vo has been conveniently related to the dopant and material properties
via Na, Nd, and n2i . The built-in voltage (Vo) is the voltage across a pn junction, going
from p- to n-type semiconductor, in an open circuit. It is not the voltage across the
diode, which is made up of Vo as well as the contact potentials at the metal-tosemiconductor junctions at the electrodes. If we add Vo and the contact potentials at
the electroded ends, we will find zero.
Once we know the built-in potential from Equation 6.6, we can then calculate
the width of the depletion region from Equation 6.4, namely
Wo = [

2ε(Na + Nd )Vo 1∕2

eNaNd

[6.7]

Notice that the depletion width Wo ∝ Vo1∕2. This results in the capacitance of the
depletion region being voltage dependent, as we will see in Section 6.3.

We use Boltzmann statistics, that is, n(E) ∝ exp(−E∕kT), because the concentration of electrons in the conduction
band, whether on the n-side or p-side, is never so large that the Pauli exclusion principle becomes important. As
long as the carrier concentration in the conduction band is much smaller than Nc, we can use Boltzmann statistics.

EXAMPLE 6.2

THE p+n JUNCTION Consider a p+n junction, which has a heavily doped p-side relative to

the n-side, that is, Na ≫ Nd. Since the amount of charge Q on both sides of the metallurgical
junction must be the same (so that the junction is overall neutral)
Q = eNaWp = eNdWn

it is clear that the depletion region essentially extends into the n-side. According to Equation 6.7,
when Nd ≪ Na, the width is
Wo = [

2εVo 1∕2

What is the depletion width for a pn junction Si diode that has been doped with 1018
acceptor atoms cm−3 on the p-side and 1016 donor atoms cm−3 on the n-side?

or

Nearly all of this region (99 percent of it) is on the n-side.

BUILT-IN VOLTAGE There is a rigorous derivation of the built-in voltage across a pn junction. Inasmuch as in equilibrium there is no net current through the pn junction, drift of holes
due to the built-in field E(x) must be just balanced by their diffusion due to the concentration
gradient dp∕dx. We can thus set the total electron and hole current densities (drift + diffusion)
through the depletion region to zero. Considering holes alone, from Equation 5.38,
Jhole (x) = ep(x)μhE(x) − eDh

dp
=0
dx

The electric field is defined by E = −dV∕dx, so substituting we find,
−epμh dV − eDh dp = 0

We can now use the Einstein relation Dh∕μh = kT∕e to get
−ep dV − kT dp = 0

We can integrate this equation. According to Figure 6.1, in the p-side, p = ppo, V = 0,
and in the n-side, p = pno, V = Vo, thus,

which is the same as Equation 6.5b and hence leads to Equation 6.6.

6.1.2 FORWARD BIAS: DIFFUSION CURRENT
Consider what happens when a battery is connected across a pn junction so that the
positive terminal of the battery is attached to the p-side and the negative terminal
to the n-side. Suppose that the applied voltage is V. It is apparent that the negative polarity of the supply will reduce the potential barrier Vo by V, as shown in
Figure 6.2a. The reason for this is that the bulk regions outside the depletion width
have high conductivities due to plenty of majority carriers in the bulk, in comparison
with the depletion region in which there are mainly immobile ions. Thus, the applied
voltage drops mostly across the depletion width W. Consequently, V directly opposes
Vo and the potential barrier against diffusion is reduced to (Vo − V ), as depicted in
Figure 6.2b. This has drastic consequences because the probability that a hole will

surmount this potential barrier and diffuse to the right now becomes proportional to
exp[−e(Vo − V )∕kT]. In other words, the applied voltage effectively reduces the
built-in potential and hence the built-in field, which acts against diffusion. Consequently many holes can now diffuse across the depletion region and enter the n-side.
This results in the injection of excess minority carriers, holes, into the n-region.
Similarly, excess electrons can now diffuse toward the p-side and enter this region
and thereby become injected minority carriers.
The hole concentration
pn(0) = pn(x′ = 0)

just outside the depletion region at x′ = 0 (x′ is measured from Wn) is due to the
excess of holes diffusing as a result of the reduction in the built-in potential barrier.
This concentration pn(0) is determined by the probability of surmounting the new
potential energy barrier e(Vo − V ),
pn (0) = ppo exp[ −

e(Vo − V)
]
kT

[6.8]

This follows directly from the Boltzmann equation, by virtue of the hole potential energy rising by e(Vo − V ) from x = −Wp to x = Wn, as indicated in Figure 6.2b,
and at the same time the hole concentration falling from ppo to pn(0). By dividing
Equation 6.8 by Equation 6.5b, we obtain the effect of the applied voltage directly,
which shows how the voltage V determines the amount of excess holes diffusing and
arriving at the n-region. Equation 6.8 divided by Equation 6.5b is
Law of the
junction

pn (0) = pno exp(

[6.9]

6 .1

IDEAL pn JUNCTION

535

which is called the law of the junction. Equation 6.9 is an important equation that
we will use again in dealing with pn junction devices. It describes the effect of the
applied voltage V on the injected minority carrier concentration just outside the
depletion region pn(0). Obviously, with no applied voltage, V = 0 and pn(0) = pno,
which is exactly what we expect.
Injected holes diffuse in the n-region and eventually recombine with electrons
in this region as there are many electrons in the n-side. Those electrons lost by
recombination are readily replenished by the negative terminal of the battery connected to this side. The current due to holes diffusing in the n-region can be sustained
because more holes can be supplied by the p-region, which itself can be replenished
by the positive terminal of the battery.
Electrons are similarly injected from the n-side to the p-side. The electron concentration np(0) just outside the depletion region at x = −Wp is given by the equivalent
of Equation 6.9 for electrons, that is,
np (0) = npo exp(

eV
kT )

[6.10]

In the p-region, the injected electrons diffuse toward the positive terminal looking to be collected. As they diffuse they recombine with some of the many holes in
this region. Those holes lost by recombination can be readily replenished by the
positive terminal of the battery connected to this side. The current due to the diffusion of electrons in the p-side can be maintained by the supply of electrons from the
n-side, which itself can be replenished by the negative terminal of the battery. It is
apparent that an electric current can be maintained through a pn junction under
forward bias, and that the current flow, surprisingly, seems to be due to the diffusion
of minority carriers. There is, however, some drift of majority carriers as well.
If the lengths of the p- and n-regions are longer than the minority carrier diffusion lengths, then we will be justified to expect the hole concentration pn(x′) on the
n-side to fall exponentially toward the thermal equilibrium value pno, that is,
x′
Δpn (x′) = Δpn (0) exp(− )
Lh

[6.11]

where
Δpn(x′) = pn(x′) − pno

is the excess carrier distribution and Lh is the hole diffusion length, defined by
Lh = √Dhτh in which τh is the mean hole recombination lifetime (minority carrier
lifetime) in the n-region. We base Equation 6.11 on our experience with the minority
carrier injection in Chapter 5.3
The hole diffusion current density JD,hole is therefore

Although this equation shows that the hole diffusion current depends on location,
the total current at any location is the sum of hole and electron contributions, which
is independent of x, as indicated in Figure 6.3. The decrease in the minority carrier
diffusion current with x′ is made up by the increase in the current due to the drift
of the majority carriers, as schematically shown in Figure 6.3. The field in the neutral region is not totally zero but a small value, just sufficient to drift the huge
number of majority carriers there.

There is a similar expression for the electron diffusion current density JD,elec in

do not change across the depletion region because, in general, the width of this region
is narrow (reality is not quite like the schematic sketches in Figures 6.2 and 6.3).

The significance of Equation 6.13 is that it reflects the dependence of I–V characteristics on the bandgap (via Vg), as displayed in Figure 6.4 for the three important

an appreciable current of say ∼0.1 mA is about 0.2 V for Ge, 0.6 V for Si, and
0.9 V for GaAs.
The diode equation, Equation 6.12a, was derived by assuming that the lengths
of the p and n regions outside the depletion region are long in comparison with the
diffusion lengths Lh and Le. Suppose that ℓp is the length of the p-side outside the
depletion region and ℓn is that of the n-side outside the depletion region. If ℓp and
ℓn are shorter than the diffusion lengths Le and Lh, respectively, then we have what
is called a short diode and consequently the minority carrier distribution profiles
fall almost linearly with distance from the depletion region, as depicted in Figure
6.5. This can be readily proved by solving the continuity equation, but an intuitive
explanation makes it clear. At x′ = 0, the minority carrier concentration is determined
by the law of the junction, whereas at the battery terminal there can be no excess
carriers as the battery will simply collect these. Since the length of the neutral region
is shorter than the diffusion length, there are practically no holes lost by recombination, and therefore the hole flow is expected to be uniform across ℓn. This can be so
only if the driving force for diffusion, the concentration gradient, is linear.

It is clear that this expression is identical to that of a long diode, that is, Equations 6.12a and b, if in the latter we replace the diffusion lengths Lh and Le by the

6.1.3

FORWARD BIAS: RECOMBINATION AND TOTAL CURRENT

So far we have assumed that, under a forward bias, the minority carriers diffusing
and recombining in the neutral regions are supplied by the external current. However,
some of the minority carriers will recombine in the depletion region. The external
current must therefore also supply the carriers lost in the recombination process in
the SCL. Consider for simplicity a symmetrical pn junction as in Figure 6.6a under
forward bias. At the metallurgical junction at the center C, the hole and electron
concentrations are pM and nM and are equal. We can find the SCL recombination
current by considering electrons recombining in the p-side in Wp and holes recombining in the n-side in Wn as shown by the shaded areas ABC and BCD, respectively,
in Figure 6.6b. Suppose that we can describe the average rate of hole recombination
in Wn by assigning holes a mean hole recombination time τh in this region. (Strictly
we should call this an effective recombination time4 as it represents an average over

The exact analysis involves what is known as Shockley-Read-Hall indirect recombination statistics, which is
discussed in more advanced textbooks. The use of effective lifetimes in the two depletion regions is equivalent
averaging recombination rates in Wp and Wn. Further, the treatment here applies to indirect recombination, that
is, through defects and impurities.

the rates of recombination in Wn.) Similarly, the mean electron recombination time
in Wp is τe. The rate at which the electrons in ABC are recombining is the area ABC
(nearly all injected electrons) divided by τe. The electrons are replenished by the
diode current. Similarly, the rate at which holes in BCD are recombining is the area
BCD divided by τh. Thus, the recombination current density is
Jrecom =

We can evaluate the areas ABC and BCD by taking them as triangles,
ABC ≈ 12WpnM , etc., so that

Under steady-state and equilibrium conditions, assuming a nondegenerate semiconductor, we can use Boltzmann statistics to relate these concentrations to the
potential energy. At A, the potential is zero and at M it is 12e(Vo − V), so
pM
e(Vo − V)

There is a similar equation for nM∕nno. Further as the pn junction is symmetric
pM = nM. Since Vo depends on dopant concentrations and ni as in Equation 6.6 and
further ppo = Na and nno = Nd, we can simplify the above equation to
pM = ni exp(

This means that the recombination current for V > kT∕e is given by

Equation 6.15 is the current that supplies the carriers that recombine in the

carrier diffusion in the neutral regions and recombination in the space charge layer,
so it will be the sum of Equations 6.12a and 6.15. For V > kT∕e,

This expression is often lumped into a single exponential as

[6.17]

where Jo is a new constant and η is an ideality factor, which is 1 when the current is
due to minority carrier diffusion in the neutral regions and 2 when it is due to recombination in the space charge layer. Figure 6.7 shows typical expected I–V characteristics of pn junction Ge, Si, and GaAs diodes. At the highest currents, invariably, the
bulk resistances of the neutral regions limit the current (why?). For Ge diodes, typically
η = 1 and the overall I–V characteristics are due to minority carrier diffusion. In the
case of both Si and GaAs, η is 2 over a wide current range but, at higher currents, it
changes to 1. The current is initially controlled by recombination in the space charge
layer but at high at sufficiently high voltages, it is due to by minority carrier diffusion
in the neutral regions, indicating that both processes play an important role. In the case
of heavily doped Si diodes, heavy doping leads to short minority carrier recombination
times and the current is controlled by recombination in the space charge layer so that
the η = 2 region extends all the way to the onset of bulk resistance limitation.

6.1.4 REVERSE BIAS
When a pn junction is reverse biased, as shown in Figure 6.8a, the applied voltage,
as before, drops mainly across the depletion region, that is, the space charge layer
(SCL), which becomes wider. The negative terminal will attract the holes in the
p-side to move away from the SCL, which results in more exposed negative acceptor ions and thus a wider SCL. Similarly, the positive terminal will attract electrons
away from the SCL, which exposes more positively charged donors. The depletion
width on the n-side also widens. The movement of electrons in the n-region toward
the positive battery terminal cannot be sustained because there is no electron supply
to this n-side. The p-side cannot supply electrons to the n-side because it has almost
none. However, there is a small reverse current due to two causes.

The applied voltage increases the built-in potential barrier, as depicted in Figure
6.8b. The electric field in the SCL is larger than the built-in internal field Eo. The
small number of holes on the n-side near the SCL become extracted and swept by
the field across the SCL over to the p-side. This small current can be maintained by
the diffusion of holes from the n-side bulk to the SCL boundary.
Assume that the reverse bias Vr > kT∕e = 25 mV. The hole concentration pn(0)
just outside the SCL is nearly zero by the law of the junction, Equation 6.9, whereas
the hole concentration in the bulk (or near the negative terminal) is the equilibrium
concentration pno, which is small. There is therefore a small concentration gradient
and hence a small hole diffusion current toward the SCL as shown in Figure 6.8a.
Similarly, there is a small electron diffusion current from bulk p-side to the SCL.
Within the SCL, these carriers are drifted by the field. This minority carrier diffusion
current is essentially the Shockley model. The reverse current is given by Equation
6.12a with a negative voltage which leads to a diode current density of −Jso called
the reverse saturation current density. The value of Jso depends only on the material via ni, μh, μe, dopant concentrations, but not on the voltage (Vr > kT∕e). Furthermore, as Jso depends on n2i , it is strongly temperature dependent. In some books it
is stated that the causes of reverse current are the thermal generation of minority
carriers in the neutral region within a diffusion length to the SCL, the diffusion of
these carriers to the SCL, and their subsequent drift through the SCL. This description,
in essence, is identical to the Shockley model we just described.
The thermal generation of electron–hole pairs (EHPs) in the SCL, as shown in
Figure 6.8a, can also contribute to the observed reverse current since the internal
field in this layer will separate the electron and hole and drift them toward the neutral regions. This drift will result in an external current in addition to the reverse
current due to the diffusion of minority carriers. The theoretical evaluation of SCL
generation current involves an in-depth knowledge of the charge carrier generation

that τg is the mean time to generate an EHP by virtue of the thermal vibrations of
the lattice; τg is also called the mean thermal generation time. Given τg, the rate
of thermal generation per unit volume must be ni∕τg because it takes on average τg
seconds to create ni number of EHPs per unit volume. Furthermore, since WA, where
A is the cross-sectional area, is the volume of the depletion region, the rate of EHP,
or charge carrier, generation is (AWni)∕τg. Both holes and electrons drift in the SCL
each contributing equally to the current. The observed current density must be
e(Wni)∕τg. Therefore, the reverse current density component due to thermal generation of EHPs within the SCL should be given by

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

The terms in the reverse current in Equation 6.19 are predominantly controlled
by n2i and ni. Their relative importance depends not only on the semiconductor
properties but also on the temperature since ni ∝ exp(−Eg∕2kT ). Figure 6.9b shows
the reverse current Irev in dark in a Ge pn junction (a photodiode) plotted as ln(Irev)
versus 1∕T to highlight the two different processes in Equation 6.19. The measurements in Figure 6.9b show that above 238 K, Irev is controlled by n2i because the
slope of ln(Irev) versus 1∕T yields an Eg of approximately 0.63 eV, close to the
expected Eg of about 0.66 eV in Ge. Below 238 K, Irev is controlled by ni because
the slope of ln (Irev) versus 1∕T is equivalent to Eg∕2 of approximately 0.33 eV. In
this range, the reverse current is due to EHP generation in the SCL via defects and
impurities (recombination centers).

EXAMPLE 6.4

An abrupt Si p+n junction diode has a crosssectional area of 1 mm , an acceptor concentration of 5 × 1018 boron atoms cm−3 on the
p-side, and a donor concentration of 1016 arsenic atoms cm−3 on the n-side. The lifetime of
holes in the n-region is 420 ns, whereas that of electrons in the p-region is 5 ns due to a
greater concentration of impurities (recombination centers) on that side. Mean thermal generation lifetime (τg) is about 1 μs. The lengths of the p- and n-regions are 5 and 100 microns,
respectively.

SOLUTION

The general expression for the diffusion length is L = √Dτ where D is the diffusion coefficient and τ is the carrier lifetime. D is related to the carrier mobility μ via the Einstein
relationship D∕μ = kT∕e. We therefore need to know μ to calculate D and hence L. Electrons
diffuse in the p-region and holes in the n-region, so we need μe in the presence of Na acceptors and μh in the presence of Nd donors. From the drift mobility, μ versus dopant concentration in Figure 5.19, we have the following:
With

Na = 5 × 1018 cm−3

μe ≈ 150 cm2 V−1 s−1

With

Nd = 1016 cm−3

μh ≈ 430 cm2 V−1 s−1

Thus, with kT∕e = 0.2585 V at 300 K, we have
De =

We note that when a forward bias of 0.6 V is applied, the built-in potential is reduced
from 0.875 V to 0.275 V, which encourages minority carrier injection, that is, diffusion of
holes from p- to n-side and electrons from n- to p-side. To find the current at 100 °C, first
we assume that Iso ∝ n2i. Then at T = 273 + 100 = 373 K, ni ≈ 1.0 × 1012 cm−3 (approximately from ni versus 1∕T graph in Figure 5.16), so

A DIRECT BANDGAP pn JUNCTION In direct bandgap semiconductors, an electron and a
hole can recombine directly, without needing a recombination center. Such a direct recombination leads to photon emission and is the basis of LEDs as discussed later in this chapter.
Consider holes injected into the n-side of a pn junction from a direct bandgap semiconductor
such as GaAs. Assume weak injection so that the excess hole concentration Δpn is much less
than the equilibrium majority carrier concentration nno. If τ′h is the mean lifetime due direct
recombination, then the probability per unit time 1∕τ′h that a hole directly recombines with
an electron depends on the concentration of electrons nno in the n-side, that is
τ′h =

where B is a constant called the direct recombination coefficient. In addition, there will
also be indirect recombination, which depends on the concentration of impurities and defects.

where τh is the effective lifetime. The quantities τ′h and τ″h are known as hole radiative and nonradiative lifetimes and are often written as τr and τnr. We can use the above expression for the
recombination of injected carriers in the neutral regions as well as the depletion region.6 Within
the depletion region, nn will be small and the hole lifetime will be due to indirect recombination.
Similar arguments can be applied to electrons on the p-side with similar expressions.
Consider a symmetrical GaAs pn junction in which the p-side doping Na is equal to the n-side
doping Nd and both are 1017 cm−3. The direct recombination coefficient B ≈ 2 × 10−16 m3 s−1,
cross sectional area A = 1 mm2. The indirect recombination lifetime is roughly 200 ns. At these
doping levels and at 300 K, the electron and hole drift mobilities are roughly μe ≈ 4500 cm2
V−1 s−1 in the p-side and μh ≈ 270 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the n-side. From the Einstein relation
(D = μkT∕e), the corresponding diffusion coefficients are Dh = 6.98 × 10−4 m2 s−1 and
De = 1.16 × 10−2 m2 s−1. Calculate the diffusion and recombination currents for this GaAs
pn junction when the forward bias is 0.8 V and 1.0 V. What is your conclusion?

There is also another recombination mechanism called Auger recombination, which occurs at high carrier
concentrations, but this is ignored in this introductory treatment.

We can calculate the direct recombination lifetimes τ′e and τ′h for electrons and holes recombining in the neutral p- and n-regions, respectively. In the n-side nn = nno = Nd = 1017 cm−3,

To find the Shockley current in Equation 6.12a we need the diffusion lengths,
Lh = (Dhτh)1∕2 = [6.98 × 10−4 m2 s−1)(40.0 × 10−9 s)]1∕2 = 5.28 × 10−6 m,

and
Le = (Deτe)1∕2 = [(1.16 × 10−2 m2 s−1)(40.0 × 10−9 s)]1∕2 = 2.16 × 10−5 m.

Notice that the electrons diffuse much further in the p-side due to their higher mobility.
From Table 5.1, ni = 2.1 × 1012 m−3, so that reverse saturation current due to diffusion in
the neutral regions is

In the depletion region both electron and hole concentrations are much less than nno and
pno respectively, which means that the direct recombination rate will be small. Put differently,
in the depletion region Bnn and Bpp are both small and, as first order, we can ignore radiative
recombination. Thus, τh = τe ≈ 200 ns.

The recombination current is more than the diffusion current. If we repeat the calculation
for a voltage of 1.0 V across the device, we would find Idiff = 0.30 mA and Irecom = 0.025 mA,
where Idiff dominates the current. Thus, as the voltage increases across a GaAs pn junction,
the ideality factor η is initially 2 but then becomes 1 as shown in Figure 6.7. It is apparent
that the I–V characteristics depend very much on the relative values of the radiative and
nonradiative lifetimes.

pn JUNCTION BAND DIAGRAM

6.2.1 OPEN CIRCUIT
Figure 6.10a shows the energy band diagrams for a p-type and an n-type semiconductor of the same material (same Eg) when the semiconductors are isolated from
each other. In the p-type material the Fermi level EFp is Φp below the vacuum level
and is close to Ev. In the n-type material the Fermi level EFn is Φn below the vacuum
level and is close to Ec. The separation Ec − EFn determines the electron concentration nno in the n-type and EFp − Ev determines the hole concentration ppo, in the
p-type semiconductor under thermal equilibrium conditions.
An important property of the Fermi energy EF is that in a system in equilibrium,
the Fermi level must be spatially continuous. A difference in Fermi levels ΔEF is
equivalent to electrical work eV, which is either done on the system or extracted
from the system. When the two semiconductors are brought together, as in Figure
6.10b, the Fermi level must be uniform through the two materials and the junction
at M, which marks the position of the metallurgical junction. Far away from M, in
the bulk of the n-type semiconductor, we should still have an n-type semiconductor
and Ec − EFn should be the same as before. Similarly, EFp − Ev far away from M
inside the p-type material should also be the same as before. These features are
sketched in Figure 6.10b keeping EFp and EFn the same through the whole system
and, of course, keeping the bandgap Ec − Ev the same. Clearly, to draw the energy

band diagram, we have to bend the bands Ec and Ev around the junction at M because
Ec on the n-side is close to EFn whereas on the p-side it is far away from EFp. How
do bands bend and what does it mean?
As soon as the two semiconductors are brought together to form the junction,
electrons diffuse from the n-side to the p-side and as they do so they deplete the
n-side near the junction. Thus Ec must move away from EFn toward M, which is
exactly what is sketched in Figure 6.10b. Holes diffuse from the p-side to the n-side
and the loss of holes in the p-type material near the junction means that Ev moves
away from EFp toward M, which is also in the figure.
Furthermore, as electrons and holes diffuse toward each other, most of them
recombine and disappear around M, which leads to the formation of a depletion
region or the space charge layer, as we saw in Figure 6.1. The electrostatic
potential energy (PE) of the electron decreases from 0 inside the p-region to −eVo
inside the n-region, as shown in Figure 6.1g. The total energy of the electron
must therefore decrease going from the p- to the n-region by an amount eVo. In
other words, the electron in the n-side at Ec must overcome a PE barrier to go
over to Ec in the p-side. This PE barrier is eVo, where Vo is the built-in potential
that we evaluated in Section 6.1. Band bending around M therefore accounts not
only for the variation of electron and hole concentrations in this region but also
for the effect of the built-in potential (and hence the built-in field as the two are
related).
In Figure 6.10b we have also schematically sketched in the positive donor (at
Ed) and the negative acceptor (at Ea) charges in the SCL around M to emphasize
that there are exposed charges near M. These charges are, of course, immobile and,
generally, they are not shown in band diagrams. It should be noted that in the SCL
region, marked as Wo, the Fermi level is close to neither Ec nor Ev, compared with
the bulk semiconductor regions. This means that both n and p in this zone are much
less than their bulk (majority carrier) values nno and ppo. The metallurgical junction

zone has been depleted of carriers compared with the bulk. Any applied voltage must
therefore drop across the SCL.

6.2.2 FORWARD AND REVERSE BIAS
The energy band diagram of the pn junction under open circuit conditions is shown
in Figure 6.11a. There is no net current, so the diffusion current of electrons from
the n- to p-side is balanced by the electron drift current from the p- to n-side driven
by the built-in field Eo. Similar arguments apply to holes. The probability that an
electron diffuses from Ec in the n-side to Ec in the p-side determines the diffusion

current density Jdiff. The probability of overcoming the PE barrier is proportional to
exp(−eVo∕kT ). Therefore, under zero bias,
Jdiff (0) = B exp(−

eVo
kT )

Jnet(0) = Jdiff (0) + Jdrift(0) = 0

[6.22]
[6.23]

where B is a proportionality constant and Jdrift(0) is the current due to the drift of
electrons by Eo. Clearly Jdrift(0) = −Jdiff (0); that is, drift is in the opposite direction
to diffusion.
When the pn junction is forward biased, the majority of the applied voltage
drops across the depletion region, so the applied voltage is in opposition to the
built-in potential Vo. Figure 6.11b shows the effect of forward bias, which is to
reduce the PE barrier from eVo to e(Vo − V ). The electrons at Ec in the n-side can
now readily overcome the PE barrier and diffuse to the p-side. The diffusing electrons from the n-side can be replenished easily by the negative terminal of the
battery connected to this side. Similarly holes can now diffuse from the p- to n-side.
The positive terminal of the battery can replenish those holes diffusing away from
the p-side. There is therefore a current flow through the junction and around
the circuit.
The probability that an electron at Ec in the n-side overcomes the new PE barrier and diffuses to Ec in the p-side is now proportional to exp[−e(Vo − V )∕kT]. The
latter increases enormously even for small forward voltages. The new diffusion current due to electrons diffusing from the n- to p-side is
Jdiff (V) = B exp[ −

e(Vo − V)
]
kT

There is still a drift current due to electrons being drifted by the new field
Eo − E (E is the applied field) in the SCL. This drift current now has the value
Jdrift(V). The net current is the diode current under forward bias
J = Jdiff(V) + Jdrift(V)

Jdrift(V ) is difficult to evaluate. As a first approximation we can assume that
although Eo has decreased to Eo − E, there is, however, an increase in the electron
concentration in the SCL due to diffusion so that we can approximately take Jdrift(V )
to remain the same as Jdrift(0). Thus,
J ≈ Jdiff (V) + Jdrift (0) = B exp[ −

We should also add to this the hole contribution, which has a similar form with

where Jo is a temperature-dependent constant.7
When a reverse bias, V = −Vr, is applied to the pn junction, the voltage again
drops across the SCL. In this case, however, Vr adds to the built-in potential Vo, so
the PE barrier becomes e(Vo + Vr), as shown in Figure 6.11c. The field in the SCL
at M increases to Eo + E, where E is the applied field.
The diffusion current due to electrons diffusing from Ec in the n-side to Ec in
the p-side is now almost negligible because it is proportional to exp[−e(Vo + Vr)∕kT],
which rapidly becomes very small with Vr. There is, however, a small reverse current arising from the drift component. When an EHP is thermally generated in the
SCL, as shown in Figure 6.11d, the field here separates the pair. The electron falls
down the PE hill, down to Ec, in the n-side to be collected by the battery. Similarly
the hole falls down its own PE hill (energy increases downward for holes) to make
it to the p-side. The process of falling down a PE hill is the same process as being
driven by a field, in this case by Eo + E. Under reverse bias conditions, there is
therefore a small reverse current that depends on the rate of thermal generation of
EHPs in the SCL. An electron in the p-side that is thermally generated within
a diffusion length Le to the SCL can diffuse to the SCL and consequently can
become drifted by the field, that is, roll down the PE hill in Figure 6.11d. Such
minority carrier thermal generation in neutral regions can also give rise to a small
reverse current.
THE BUILT-IN VOLTAGE Vo FROM THE ENERGY BAND DIAGRAM The energy band treatment allows a simple way to calculate Vo. When the junction is formed in Figure 6.10 from
a to b, EFp and EFn must shift and line up. Using the energy band diagrams in this figure and
semiconductor equations for n and p, derive an expression for the built-in voltage Vo in terms
of the material and doping properties Nd, Na, and ni.
SOLUTION

The shift in EFp and EFn to line up is clearly Φp − Φn, the work function difference. Thus
the PE barrier eVo is Φp − Φn. From Figure 6.10, we have
eVo = Φp − Φn = (Ec − EFp) − (Ec − EFn)

But on the p- and n-sides, the electron concentrations in thermal equilibrium are
given by

The derivation is similar to that for the Schottky diode, but there are more assumptions here.

From these equations, we can now substitute for (Ec − EFp) and (Ec − EFn) in the expression for eVo. The Nc cancel and we obtain

DEPLETION LAYER CAPACITANCE
OF THE pn JUNCTION

It is apparent that the depletion region of a pn junction has positive and negative
charges separated over a distance W similar to a parallel plate capacitor. The stored
charge in the depletion region, however, unlike the case of a parallel plate capacitor,
does not depend linearly on the voltage. It is useful to define an incremental capacitance
that relates the incremental charge stored to an incremental voltage change across
the pn junction.
With an applied voltage V, the width of the depletion region is given by Equation 6.7
2ε(Na + Nd )(Vo − V) 1∕2
W=
[6.25]
[
]
eNa Nd
where, for forward bias, V is positive, which reduces Vo, and, for reverse bias, V is
negative, so Vo is increased. We are interested in obtaining the capacitance of the
depletion region under dynamic conditions, that is, when V is a function of time.
When the applied voltage V changes by dV, to V + dV, then W also changes via
Equation 6.25, and as a result, the amount of charge in the depletion region becomes
Q + dQ, as shown in Figure 6.12a for the reverse bias case, that is, V = −Vr and
dV = −dVr. The depletion layer capacitance Cdep is defined by

with increasing reverse bias, which is expected since the separation of the charges
increases via W ∝ (Vo + Vr)1∕2. The capacitance Cdep is present under both forward
and reverse bias conditions.
The simple parallel plate capacitance expression Cdep = εA∕W in Equation 6.27
was derived for an abrupt junction in which both the p and n-sides have uniform
acceptor and donor concentration. It may seem unusual but it turns out that Cdep =
εA∕W is generally valid whatever the dopant concentration profiles are. Consider a
one-sided pn junction in which the p-side is much more heavily doped, denoted as
p+, than the n-side as shown in Figure 6.13a. The depletion width extends almost
entirely into the lightly doped n-side and we can take W ≈ Wn. Under a reverse bias
of Vr, the +Q charge in the n-side is within W. When we increase Vr to Vr + dVr,
the charge Q increases to Q + dQ as shown in Figure 6.13b. Take the net space
charge density ρnet = eNd (x) in the n-side depletion region. The total charge and the
maximum field Eo from Equation 6.2 are given by

so that Eo = −Q∕Aε and thus dEo = −dQ∕Aε. Further, the integration of ∣E(x)∣
over x upto W gives Vr which is the area under the curve of ∣E(x)∣ as indicated in
Figure 6.13c. When we increase Vr to Vr + dVr, this area increases by an amount
shown as dark grey, which is dVr . The additional dVr drops across W and gives rise
to −dEo so that8 dVr∕W = −dEo. Thus,
Cdep = dQ∕dVr = (−εAdEo)∕(−WdEo)
It seems intuitively correct that dVr∕W = ∣dEo∣, but a rigorous proof is by no means trivial. The field depends
on the integration of ρnet and Vr depends on the double integration of ρnet. We then have to differentiate the
latter integral to obtain dVr∕W = ∣dEo∣.

[6.28]

Equation 6.28 is generally valid even if we do not have a one-sided junction,
and is basically Equation 6.27 for a uniformly doped abrupt junction. Since W
depends on the voltage, so does the depletion capacitance.
Suppose that we assume that the donor concentration in the p+n junction follows
Nd (x) = Bxm as shown in Figure 6.13b; and d for three m values. Obviously, m = 0
is the abrupt junction case. If we integrate ρnet = eBxm across the depletion region
W, we would get the field and if we integrate it again, we would find the total voltage across the depletion region, Vo − V or Vo + Vr as a function of W, that is the
dependence of W on (Vo − V ). We can then substitute for W in Equation 6.28 and
find Cdep as
1∕(m+2)
eεm+1B
Cdep = A[
(m + 2)(Vo − V) ]

[6.29]

in which V = −Vr for reverse bias. Clearly under suitable reverse bias Vr > Vo, and
Cdep ∝ Vr−1∕(m+2) which implies that we should design a pn junction whose Cdep
dependence on the external Vr can be controlled. Notice that m = 1 gives Cdep ∝
Vr−1∕2 as expected from Equation 6.27. For many pn junctions, the dopant concentration

on both or on one side can be approximated as a linear variation (m = 1) so that

The voltage dependence of the depletion capacitance is utilized in varactor
diodes (varicaps), which are used as voltage-dependent capacitors in tuning circuits.
A varactor diode is reverse biased to prevent conduction, and its depletion capacitance is varied by the magnitude of the reverse bias. The resonant frequency of an
LC circuit with a varactor will be

so that substituting A = π(250 × 10−6 m)2 = 1.97 × 10−7 m2, ε = εoεr, εr = 11.9, we find
Nd = 7.0 × 1021 m−3 or Nd = 7.0 × 1015 cm−3.
We can also extract Na by using Vo = (kT∕e)ln(NaNd∕ni2), which gives Na = 4.0 × 1023 m−3
or 4.0 × 1017 cm−3; a reasonable value. While these are reasonable values, they do depend
on the stray capacitance, especially Na. If we repeat the above calculations for different Cs
we would find the results in Table 6.3. Notice that while Nd values are comparable between
different Cs values, Na is extremely sensitive to stray capacitance and varies by five orders
of magnitude. Clearly, stray capacitance correction is very important, assuming everything
else has been accounted (including the assumption of an abrupt junction).

The simplest way to fabricate a pn junction is to diffuse dopants into a Si wafer at a high temperature in a diffusion chamber. Consider an n-type
Si crystal and we expose one surface of the crystal to a boron gas at a high temperature in
a diffusion chamber. B-atoms from the gas enter and diffuse into the Si-crystal as depicted
in Figure 6.15. The boron (acceptor) concentration Na decays with x as shown in Figure 6.15
at two times t1 and t2 where t2 > t1. The whole acceptor concentration profile Na(x) widens

The B-gas provides a constant flux of B-atoms to the surface (an infinite source). The point
x = xj where Na = Nd defines the metallurgical junction. To the left, x < xj, Na > Nd, and this
side is p-type. To the right, x > xj, Nd > Na, and this side is n-type. A pn junction is formed
with its junction at x = xj and there is a depletion region of width Wo around this junction
as shown in Figure 6.15. The problem is similar to the one-sided junction and the depletion
layer capacitance is given by Equation 6.29 with m = 1. Figure 6.16a shows a plot of 1∕C 3dep
against Vr for a commercial diffused junction Si power diode and the data seem to confirm
a linearly graded junction behavior and the best line is y = (1.49 × 10−5)x + 5.47 × 10−6
which gives a built-in voltage Vo = 0.37 V or roughly 0.4 V on the Vr axis; the determination
of the intercept for Vo is quite sensitive to stray capacitances. We can further check the linearly

graded junction assumption by plotting Cdep against Vr + Vo on a log–log plot as in Figure
6.15b which shows a best power fit of Cdep ∝ (Vr + Vo)−0.337. Clearly, the assumption is well
supported for this diode and the junction is linearly graded.
Suppose we take xj as x = 0, then Nd − Na = Bx, where B is the gradient of the doping
profile. We can easily find the built-in potential Vo by noting that, as shown in Figure 6.15,
the hole concentration at positions 1 and 2 in equilibrium are ppo(1) = BWo∕2 and pno(2) =
ni2∕nno(2) = ni2∕(BWo∕2). If we apply Boltzmann statistics (i.e., assume a nondegenerate

Capacitance measurements under reverse bias in Figure 6.16a, in principle, provide Vo. We
then have two equations with two unknowns, B and Wo in Equations 6.31 and 6.32, and hence
we can find B and Wo. Thus, using Vo ≈ 0.4 V in Equations 6.31 and 6.32, we find,
B ≈ 5.5 × 1016 cm−4

and

Wo ≈ 8.3 × 10−6 m or 8.3 μm

which are quite sensitive to the exact value of Vo and hence to experimental uncertainties,
that is parasitic capacitances and whether the linear doping profile is linear over the whole
depletion width. As we move away from the junction, the linearity will be lost. If we
know the cross sectional area of the pn junction we can use the slope of the best line in
Figure 6.16a to find B.

6.4

DIFFUSION (STORAGE) CAPACITANCE
AND DYNAMIC RESISTANCE

The diffusion or storage capacitance arises under forward bias only. As shown in
Figure 6.2a, when the p+n junction is forward biased, we have stored a positive charge
on the n-side by the continuous injection and diffusion of minority carriers. Similarly,
a negative charge has been stored on the p+-side by electron injection, but the magnitude of this negative charge is small for the p+n junction. When the applied voltage
is increased from V to V + dV, as shown in Figure 6.17, then pn(0) changes from
pn(0) to p′n(0). If dQ is the additional minority carrier charge injected into the n-side,
as a result of a small increase dV in V, then the incremental storage or diffusion
capacitance Cdiff is defined as Cdiff = dQ∕dV. At voltage V, the injected positive
charge Q on the n-side is disappearing by recombination at a rate Q∕τh, where τh is
the minority carrier lifetime. The diode current I is therefore Q∕τh, from which
Q = τh I = τh Io[ exp(

where we used e∕kT ≈ 1∕0.025 at room temperature. (Note that 1∕0.026 is also
commonly used.) Generally the value of the diffusion capacitance, typically in the
nanofarads range, far exceeds that of the depletion layer capacitance.
Suppose that the voltage V across the diode is increased by an infinitesimally
small amount dV, as shown in an exaggerated way in Figure 6.18. This gives rise to
a small increase dI in the diode current. We define the dynamic or incremental
resistance rd of the diode as dV∕dI, so

DIFFUSION (STORAGE) CAPACITANCE AND DYNAMIC RESISTANCE

The dynamic resistance rd and diffusion capacitance Cdiff of a diode determine
its response to small ac signals under forward bias conditions. By small we usually
mean voltages smaller than the thermal voltage kT∕e or 25 mV at room temperature.
For small ac signals we can simply represent a forward-biased diode as a resistance
rd in parallel with a capacitance Cdiff.
Equation 6.36a applies to a long diode, and cannot be used for a short diode. The
reason is that the injected minority carriers simply diffuse and reach the collecting
electrodes. The minority carrier profile is a straight line whose gradient determines
the diffusion current as in Figure 6.5. The diode current I supplies the minority carriers that diffuse through the neutral regions and reach the electrodes. Consider a
p+n junction and the diffusion of holes on the n-side as in Figure 6.5. If τt is the
diffusion time of holes across ℓn, then we know from Chapter 1 that ℓn = (2Dhτt)1∕2.
If the total charge injected into the neutral n-side is Q (the grey area in Figure 6.17
under the pn(x) profile) then this charge takes τt seconds to diffuse across ℓn and the
current I must replace Q every τt seconds so that I = Q∕τt. Thus Q = Iτt, and following along the lines above for the long diode, we can easily show that
rd Cdiff = τt

Clearly the diffusion capacitance (83 nF) that arises during forward bias completely overwhelms the depletion capacitance (600 pF).
We note that there is also a diffusion capacitance due to electrons injected and stored in
the p-region. However, electron lifetime in the p-region is very short (here 5 ns), so the value
of this capacitance is much smaller than that due to holes in the n-region. In calculating the
diffusion capacitance, we normally consider the minority carriers that have the longest recombination lifetime, here τh. These are the carriers that take a long time to disappear by recombination when the bias is suddenly switched off.

REVERSE BREAKDOWN: AVALANCHE
AND ZENER BREAKDOWN

The reverse voltage across a pn junction cannot be increased without limit. Eventually the pn junction breaks down either by the Avalanche or Zener breakdown mechanisms, which lead to large reverse currents, as shown in Figure 6.19. In the V = −Vbr
region, the reverse current increases dramatically with the reverse bias. If unlimited,
the large reverse current will increase the power dissipated, which in turn raises the
temperature of the device, which leads to a further increase in the reverse current
and so on. If the temperature does not burn out the device, for example, by melting
the contacts, then the breakdown is recoverable. If the current is limited by an external resistance to a value within the power dissipation specifications, then there is no
reason why the device cannot operate under breakdown conditions.

6.5.1 AVALANCHE BREAKDOWN
As the reverse bias increases, the field in the SCL can become so large that an
electron drifting in this region can gain sufficient kinetic energy to impact on a Si
atom and ionize it, or rupture a Si–Si bond. The phenomenon by which a drifting
electron gains sufficient energy from the field to ionize a host crystal atom by

bombardment is termed impact ionization. The accelerated electron must gain at
least an energy equal to Eg as impact ionization breaks a Si–Si bond, which is tantamount to exciting an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Thus,
an additional EHP is created by this process. The actual energy needed by the accelerating electron to ionize the crystal turns out to be more than Eg because we need
to also obey the conservation of momentum principle.
Consider what happens when a thermally generated electron just inside the SCL
in the p-side is accelerated by the field. The electron accelerates and gains sufficient
energy to collide with a host Si atom and release an EHP by impact ionization, as
depicted in Figure 6.20. It will lose at least Eg amount of energy, but it can accelerate and head for another ionizing collision further along the depletion region until
it reaches the neutral n-region. The EHPs generated by impact ionization themselves
can now be accelerated by the field and will themselves give rise to further EHPs
by ionizing collisions and so on, leading to an avalanche effect. One initial carrier
can thus create many carriers in the SCL through an avalanche of impact ionizations.
If the reverse current in the SCL in the absence of impact ionization is Io, then
due to the avalanche of ionizing collisions in the SCL, the reverse current becomes
MIo where M is the multiplication. It is the net number of carriers generated by the
avalanche effect per carrier in the SCL. Impact ionization depends strongly on the
electric field. Small increases in the reverse bias can lead to dramatic increases in
the multiplication process. Typically
M=

where Vr is the reverse bias, Vbr is the breakdown voltage, and n is an index in the
range 3 to 5. It is clear that the reverse current MIo increases sharply with Vr near
Vbr, as depicted in Figure 6.19. Indeed, the voltage across a diode under reverse
breakdown remains around Vbr for very large current variations (several orders of
magnitude). If the reverse current under breakdown is limited by an appropriate
external resistor R, as shown in Figure 6.21, to prevent destructive power dissipation
in the diode, then the voltage across the diode remains approximately at Vbr. Thus,

as long as Vr > Vbr, the diode clamps the voltage between A and B to approximately
Vbr. The reverse current in the circuit is then (Vr − Vbr)∕R.
Since the electric field in the SCL depends on the width of the depletion region
W, which in turn depends on the doping parameters, Vbr also depends on the doping,
as discussed in Example 6.10. In addition, the avalanche breakdown voltage is higher
in wider bandgap semiconductors because the impact ionization depends on exciting
an electron across the bandgap.

6.5.2 ZENER BREAKDOWN
Heavily doped pn junctions have narrow depletion widths, which lead to large electric fields within this region. When a reverse bias is applied to a pn junction, the
energy band diagram of the n-side can be viewed as being lowered with respect to
the p-side, as depicted in Figure 6.22. For a sufficient reverse bias (typically less
than 10 V), Ec on the n-side may be lowered to be below Ev on the p-side. This
means that electrons at the top of the VB in the p-side are now at the same energy
level as the empty states in the CB in the n-side. As the separation between the VB
and CB narrows, shown as a (< W ), the electrons easily tunnel from the VB in the
p-side to the CB in the n-side, which leads to a current. This process is called the
Zener effect. As there are many electrons in the VB and many empty states in
the CB, the tunneling current can be substantial. The reverse voltage Vr, which starts
the tunneling current and hence the Zener breakdown, is clearly that which lowers
Ec on the n-side to be below Ev on the p-side and thereby gives a separation that
encourages tunneling. In nonquantum mechanical terms, one may intuitively view

SOLUTION

One can assume that all the applied reverse bias drops across the depletion layer so that the
new voltage across W is now Vo + Vr. We have to integrate dE∕dx = ρnet∕ε as before across
W to find the maximum field. The most important fact to remember here is that the pn junction equations relating W, Eo, Vo, No, Nd, and so on remain the same but with Vo replaced with
Vo + Vr since the applied reverse bias of Vr increases Vo to Vo + Vr. Then from Equation 6.4,
W2 =

since Na ≫ Nd. The maximum field that corresponds to the breakdown field Ebr is given by

Given Na ≫ Nd we have a p+n junction with Nd = 1016 cm−3. The depletion region
extends into the n-region, so the maximum field actually occurs in the n-region. Here the
breakdown field Ebr depends on the doping level as given in the graph of the critical field
at breakdown Ebr versus doping concentration Nd in Figure 6.23a. Taking Ebr ≈ 40 V∕μm or
4.0 × 105 V cm−1 at Nd = 1016 cm−3 and using the above equation for Vbr, we get Vbr = 53 V.
From Figure 6.23b, on the other hand, Vbr is close to 60 V (a difference of around 12%).
When Nd = 1017 cm−3, Ebr from the graph is about 6.2 × 105 V cm−1, which leads to
Vbr = 12.6 V. Figure 6.23b, on the other hand, gives Vbr that is close to 12 V. Both Ebr and
Vbr can be represented by straightforward empirical relationships as in Question 6.13, which
simplifies the calculations.

LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (LED)

6.6.1 LED PRINCIPLES
A light emitting diode (LED) is essentially a pn junction diode typically made from
a direct bandgap semiconductor, for example, GaAs, in which the EHP recombination
results in the emission of a photon. The emitted photon energy hf is approximately
equal to the bandgap energy Eg. Figure 6.24a shows the energy band diagram of an
unbiased pn+ junction device in which the n-side is more heavily doped than the p-side.
The Fermi level EF is uniform through the device, which is a requirement of equilibrium
with no applied bias. The depletion region extends mainly into the p-side. There is a
PE barrier eVo from Ec on the n-side to Ec on the p-side where Vo is the built-in voltage.
The PE barrier eVo prevents the diffusion of electrons from the n-side to the p-side.
When a forward bias V is applied, the built-in potential Vo is reduced to Vo − V,
which then allows the electrons from the n+-side to diffuse, that is, become injected,
into the p-side as depicted in Figure 6.24b. The hole injection component from p into
the n+-side is much smaller than the electron injection component from the n+-side to
the p-side. The recombination of injected electrons in the depletion region and within
a volume extending over the electron diffusion length Le in the p-side leads to photon

emission. The phenomenon of light emission from the EHP recombination as a result
of minority carrier injection is called injection electroluminescence. Due to the statistical nature of the recombination process between electrons and holes, the emitted
photons are in random directions; they result from spontaneous recombination processes between electrons and holes. Such spontaneous direct recombination processes
result in spontaneous photon emission. The emitted photon has an energy that is
roughly equal to the bandgap, that is hf ≈ Eg. The LED structure has to be such that
the emitted photons can escape the device without being reabsorbed by the semiconductor material. This means the p-side has to be sufficiently narrow or we have to use
heterostructure devices as discussed below.

Herbert Kroemer (left), along with Zhores Alferov, played a key
role in the development of semiconductor heterostructuctures
that are widely used in modern optoelectronics. Herbert
Kroemer was also well-recognized for his experimental work
on the fabrication of heterostructures by using an atomic

6.6.2 HETEROJUNCTION HIGH-INTENSITY LEDS
A pn junction between two differently doped semiconductors that are of the same
material, that is, the same bandgap Eg, is called a homojunction. A junction between
two different bandgap semiconductors is called a heterojunction. A semiconductor
device structure that has junctions between different bandgap materials is called a
heterostructure device.
LED constructions for increasing the intensity of the output light make use of
the double heterostructure. Figure 6.25a shows a double-heterostructure (DH)
device based on two junctions between different semiconductor materials with different bandgaps. In this case the semiconductors are AlGaAs with Eg ≈ 2 eV and
GaAs with Eg ≈ 1.4 eV. The double heterostructure in Figure 6.25a has an n+p
heterojunction between n+-AlGaAs and p-GaAs. There is another heterojunction
between p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs. The p-GaAs region is a thin layer, typically a fraction of a micron, and it is lightly doped.

LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (LED)

The simplified energy band diagram for the whole device in the absence of an
applied voltage is shown in Figure 6.25b. The Fermi level EF is continuous throughout the whole structure. There is a potential energy barrier eVo for electrons in the
CB of n+-AlGaAs against diffusion into p-GaAs. There is a bandgap change at the
junction between p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs which results in a step change ΔEc in Ec
between the two conduction bands of p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs. This ΔEc is effectively
a potential energy barrier that prevents any electrons in the CB in p-GaAs passing
to the CB of p-AlGaAs. (There is also a step change ΔEv in Ev, but this is small and
is not shown.)
When a forward bias is applied, most of this voltage drops between the n+AlGaAs and p-GaAs and reduces the potential energy barrier eVo, just as in the
normal pn junction. This allows electrons in the CB of n+-AlGaAs to be injected
into p-GaAs as shown in Figure 6.25c. These electrons, however, are confined to
the CB of p-GaAs since there is a barrier ΔEc between p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs.
The wide bandgap AlGaAs layer therefore acts as a confining layer that restrict
injected electrons to the p-GaAs layer. The recombination of injected electrons
and the holes in this p-GaAs layer results in spontaneous photon emission. The
radiative recombination and photon generation takes place in the p-GaAs layer,
which is called the active layer. Since the bandgap (2 eV) of AlGaAs is greater
than GaAs, the emitted photons do not get reabsorbed as they escape the active
region and can reach the surface of the device as depicted in Figure 6.25d. Since
light is also not absorbed in p-AlGaAs, it can be reflected to increase the light
output.
The holes lost by recombination with electrons in the p-GaAs layer are readily
replenished by p-AlGaAs, connected to the positive terminal. Further, notice that the
potential energy barrier against hole injection from p-GaAs into n+-AlGaAs is quite
large, compared to the homojunction case, which suppresses the flow of holes away
from p-GaAs into n+-AlGaAs.

6.6.3 QUANTUM WELL HIGH INTENSITY LEDS
A typical quantum well (QW) device has an ultra thin, typically less than 50 nm,
narrow bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap Eg1 sandwiched between two wider
bandgap semiconductors with a bandgap Eg2, as shown in Figure 6.26a. The quantum
well could be a thin GaAs (Eg1) layer sandwiched between two AlGaAs (Eg2) layers.
The wide bandgap layers are called confining layers. The two semiconductors are
always lattice matched, that is, they have the same crystal structure and lattice parameter a. This means that interface defects due to the mismatch of crystal dimensions
between the two semiconductor crystals are minimal. Since bandgap Eg changes at
the interface, there are discontinuities in Ec and Ev at the interfaces. These discontinuities, ΔEc and ΔEv, are shown in Figure 6.26b, and depend on the semiconductor
properties. The potential energy barrier ΔEc confines the conduction electrons in the
thin Eg1-layer in the x-direction, though they are free in the y- and z-directions. This
confinement length d, the width of the thin Eg1-semiconductor, is so small that we
can treat the electron as in a one-dimensional (1D) potential energy (PE) well in the
x-direction but as if it were free in the yz plane.

where n is a quantum number having the values 1, 2, 3, . . . , and ky and kz are the
wavevectors of the electron along y- and z-directions. The reason for including Ec in
Equation 6.38 is that the potential energy barriers are defined with respect to Ec as in
Figure 6.26b. The second term is the energy of an electron in an infinite PE well,
whereas we have a finite PE well of depth ΔEc. The second term is therefore only an
approximation. The minimum energy E1 corresponds to n = 1 and is above Ec of the
Eg1-semiconductor as shown in Figure 6.26b. For any given n value, we have a sub-band
of energies due to ky and kz terms in Equation 6.38; these sub-bands are also shown
in Figure 6.26b. The separation between the energy levels associated with motion in
the yz plane in a sub-band is so small that the electron is free to move in the yz plane
as if it were in the bulk semiconductor. We therefore have a two-dimensional electron
gas which is confined in the x-direction. The holes in the valence band are confined
by the potential energy barrier ΔEv (hole energy is in the opposite direction to electron
energy) and behave similarly as depicted in Figure 6.26b. They are characterized by
the quantum number n′ = 1, 2, etc. corresponding to the levels E1′, E2′, etc. Remember
that in a finite PE well, there may only be a few energy levels; in the present example,
three within ΔEc and two in ΔEv as in Figure 6.26b. The structure in Figure 6.26a has
only one QW and is called a single quantum well (SQW). However, it is also possible to include a number of QWs that are separated by a fixed distance, in which case
the structure is called a multiple quantum well (MQW).

We can easily sandwich the QW between a p-type and an n-type wider Egsemiconductors. If we apply a forward bias, then electrons and holes would be injected
into the QW as shown in Figure 6.26b. The electrons reaching the QW from the n-side
will fall down the energy levels, from E3 to E2 and then to E1 and will populate E1 where
the electron concentration can be large. Similarly, holes reaching the QW from the p-side
will drop from E2′ to E1′and populate the states at E1′. Radiative recombination occurs
between electrons and holes in the QW with photon emission. These photons can easily
escape the QW as the surrounding semiconductor has a wider bandgap.10 The sandwiched
QW is the active layer. There are two distinct advantages to a QW. First is that the electrons and holes are both confined in a very narrow space, and hence unable to avoid each
other, which encourages recombination. Secondly, there are a large number of states at
the lowest energies (at E1 and E1′) compared with what one would expect at Ec and Ev if
this were simply a bulk semiconductor. In a 3D bulk crystal, the density of states increases
as E1∕2 being zero at Ec but in a 2D solid, the density of states is constant at E1.
The main problem with the single quantum well (SQW) heterostructure LEDs
is that, under a sufficiently large current, the well can be flooded with charge carriers and can overflow. For example, electrons can flood the QW and the well will
overflow. The advantages of the QW action (such as confinement that increases the
electron concentration) would be lost. The light output will no longer increase proportionally to the current, and will fall behind the increase in the current. This
problem has been resolved by using multiple quantum wells in which electrons are
shared by a number of quantum wells. Modern high intensity UV, violet and blue
LEDs use MQW heterostructures. They use a thin InxGa1−xN (Eg1) QW layer that is
sandwiched between GaN (Eg2) layers. GaN has a large bandgap of 3.4 eV, and the
composition and hence the bandgap of InGaN is chosen for the application, e.g., for
blue, Eg1 = 2.7 eV. The heterostructure has a number of MQWs to improve the
efficiency but the number of QWs is not many; limited by the fabrication process.
AlN, InN, and GaN and their alloys are called III-Nitrides with wide bandgaps that
cover green, blue and UV emission.
10
The radiative transitions in a QW must obey a selection rule, which requires the initial and final quantum
numbers, n and n′ to be the same. The transition from n = 1 to n′ = 1 is allowed and emits a photon, as well
that from n = 2 to n′ = 2.

LED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES

There are various direct bandgap semiconductor materials that can be readily doped
to make commercial pn junction LEDs which emit radiation in the red and infrared
range of wavelengths. III–V ternary alloys based on alloying GaAs and GaP and
denoted as GaAs1−yPy represent an important class of commercial semiconductor
materials that covers the visible spectrum. In this compound, As and P atoms from
Group V are distributed randomly at normal As sites in the GaAs crystal structure.
When y < 0.45, the alloy GaAs1−yPy is a direct bandgap semiconductor and hence
the EHP recombination process is direct as shown in Figure 6.27a. The rate of
recombination is directly proportional to the product of electron and hole concentrations.
The emitted wavelengths range from about 630 nm, red, for y = 0.45 (GaAs0.55P0.45)
to 870 nm for y = 0 (GaAs).
GaAs1−yPy alloys (which include GaP) with y > 0.5 are indirect bandgap semiconductors. The EHP recombination processes occur through recombination centers
and involve lattice vibrations rather than photon emission. However, if we add
isoelectronic impurities or dopants such as nitrogen (in the same Group V as P)
into the semiconductor crystal, then these N atoms substitute for P atoms. Since N
and P have the same valency, N atoms substituting for P atoms form the same number of bonds and do not act as donors or acceptors. The electronic cores of N and
P, however, are different. The positive nucleus of N is less shielded by electrons
compared with that of the P atom. This means that a conduction electron in the
neighborhood of an N atom will be attracted and may become captured at this site.
N atoms therefore introduce localized energy levels, or electron traps, EN near the
conduction band (CB) edge as depicted in Figure 6.26b. When a conduction electron
is captured at EN, it can attract a hole (in the valence band) in its vicinity by Coulombic attraction and eventually recombine with it directly and emit a photon. The
emitted photon energy is only slightly less than Eg as EN is typically close to Ec,
e.g., Eg = 2.26 eV for GaP and EN is 0.05–0.15 eV below Ec. As the recombination
process depends on N doping, it is not as efficient as direct recombination. Thus,
the efficiency of LEDs from N-doped indirect bandgap GaAs1−yPy semiconductors
is less than those from direct bandgap compositions. Nitrogen-doped indirect bandgap GaAs1−yPy alloys are widely used in inexpensive green, yellow, and orange LEDs.

Ternary alloys based on Al1−xGaxAs where x < 0.43 are direct bandgap semiconductors. The composition can be varied to adjust the bandgap and hence the
emitted radiation, from about 640 to 870 nm, from deep red to infrared, corresponding to GaAs (Eg = 1.42 eV).
AlGaInP is a quarternary III–V alloy (In, Ga, Al from III and P from V) that
has a direct bandgap variation with composition over the visible range. This III–V
alloy material system can be lattice matched to GaAs substrates for compositions
(AlxGa1−x)0.5In0.5P where x < 0.53, that is, Ga0.50In0.50P (Eg = 1.89 eV, red) to
Al0.265Ga0.235 In0.50P (2.33 eV, green). Many commercial brands of high-intensity LEDs
have been based on this material system, which is likely to continue to be used in the
high-intensity visible LED range, especially for the red, amber and yellow.
AlN, InN, and GaN and their alloys are called III-Nitrides with wide bandgaps
that cover green, blue, and UV emission. GaN is a direct bandgap semiconductor
with an Eg of 3.4 eV. The blue GaN LEDs actually use the GaN alloy InGaN with
a bandgap of about 2.7 eV which corresponds to blue emission. One of the most
important technological advances in the last two decades has been the development
of various III-Nitride LEDs that can emit high intensity light from the UV to green.
GaN (Eg = 3.4 eV) and InN (Eg = 0.77 eV) alloys, InxGa1−xN, span wavelengths
from the UV up to the IR, though they are currently not used beyond the green
wavelength as other semiconductors such as AlGaInP provide better efficiencies.
The alloys of AlN (Eg = 6.2 eV) and GaN (Eg = 3.4 eV), AlGaN, have emission
wavelengths in the UV. GaN can be doped n-type (e.g., Si or Ge) and p-type (e.g.,
Mg), and the GaN LEDs are generally MQW heterostructures. Table 6.4 provides
a short summary of some LED materials, their wavelengths of emission and typical efficiencies.

Figure 6.28 A schematic illustration of two types of LEDs. (a) AlGaInP high intensity
heterostructure LED. (b) Multiple quantum well III-Nitride based LED.

A double heterostructure AlGaInP LED cross section is shown in Figure 6.28a,
which is a good illustrative example. There are at least four layers that need to be
grown on a substrate, which is n-GaAs. The substrate is essentially a sufficiently
thick crystal that serves as a mechanical support for the pn junction device (the doped
layers) and can be of different crystal. Starting with the first layer, the n-type confining layer (n-AlInP), the layers are grown epitaxially on the substrate. Epitaxy is the
growth of a layer of single crystal material on top of a single crystal substrate in
such a way that the new layer has the same structure as the substrate crystal. If the
epitaxial layer and the substrate crystals have different crystal lattice parameters, then
there is a lattice mismatch between the two crystal structures. This causes lattice
strain in the LED layer and hence leads to crystal defects. Such crystal defects
encourage radiationless EHP recombinations. That is, a defect acts as a recombination center. Such defects are reduced by lattice matching the LED epitaxial layer to
the substrate crystal. It is therefore important to lattice match the LED layers to the
substrate crystal.
The active layer is a thin AlGaInP (e.g., Al0.35Ga0.15In0.5P), which is only lightly
doped. This layer is sandwiched by confining layers that are p-type and n-type AlInP
(e.g., Al0.5In0.5P) on the positive and negative terminal sides, respectively. AlInP has
a wider bandgap than AlGaInP, and the band offsets confine the carriers to the active
region. Under forward bias, the p-AlInP injects holes and n-AlInP injects electrons
into the active layer. The top layer is p-GaP and serves to spread out the current to
regions outside the top contact. Thus, radiative recombinations are reduced right
under the top contact from which photons cannot be extracted. AlGaInP LEDs are
currently the best choice for high intensity LEDs in the red, orange, and yellow regions.
Figure 6.28b shows a simplified III-Nitride based MQW LED for blue or green
emission. With some modification to compositions, it can also emit in the UV. The
p-GaN (doped with Mg) is the p-layer that is used for the injection of holes. The
QWs are formed between the narrower Eg InGaN and wider Eg GaN, which are
undoped. There is a p-AlGaN layer that is called a buffer layer. The bandgap of
AlGaN is wider than InGaN, so it confines the injected electrons in the QW-region.
The n-GaN layer is the electron injecting n-type semiconductor from which electrons
are injected into the MQWs. A sapphire crystal is the most commonly used substrate

for GaN though the mismatch is roughly 12 percent (significant). Special growth
techniques have been developed to keep the defects (dislocations) to the initial GaN
growth region near the sapphire/GaN interface, away from actual LED heterostructure. Notice that the negative terminal is on high quality n-GaN, away from the
defective region in n-GaN, near the substrate (sapphire) interface in Figure 6.28b.
Not all light rays reaching the semiconductor–air interface, however, can escape
because of total internal reflection (TIR). Those rays with angles of incidence greater
than the critical angle θc become reflected as depicted in Figure 6.29a. For the GaAsair interface, for example, θc is only 17° which means that much of the light suffers
TIR. An inexpensive and common procedure that reduces TIR is the encapsulation
of the semiconductor junction within a transparent plastic medium (an epoxy) which
has a higher refractive index greater than air and, further, also has a domed surface
on the emission side of the LED chip as shown in Figure 6.29b. The epoxy is refractive index matched to the semiconductor to avoid TIR at the semiconductor∕plastic
interface. The rays reaching the dome’s surface have angles narrower than θc and do
not suffer TIR. Many individual LEDs are sold in similar types of plastic bodies.
Another example of a device structure that improves the light extraction ratio is
shown in Figure 6.29c. The surface has been textured or nanostructured. Such a
textured surface allows light to escape after one or two reflections. Light extraction
is critical to improving the optical power that can be extracted from an LED. We
also need to consider the light that is emitted backwards, towards the substrate, as
in Figure 6.29a. In some modern LEDs, layers of different refractive index semiconductors are used to construct a dielectric mirror that can reflect the backward traveling
light toward the surface.11

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

LED OUTPUT SPECTRUM

The emitted photon energy from an LED is not simply equal to the bandgap energy
Eg because electrons in the conduction band (CB) are distributed in energy and so
are the holes in the valence band (VB). Consider a p-type active region and the
injection of excess electrons into this layer by forward bias. Figure 6.30a and b
illustrate the energy band diagram and the energy distributions of electrons and holes
in the CB and VB, respectively for a p-type semiconductor. The electron concentration
as a function of energy in the CB is given by g(E)f(E) where g(E) is the density of
states in the CB and f(E) is the Fermi-Dirac function (probability of finding an electron in a state with energy E). The product g(E)f (E) represents the electron concentration per unit energy, nE(E). Suppose that we use the Boltzmann approximation
for f (E). The corresponding nE(E) is plotted along the horizontal axis in Figure 6.30b.
There is a similar energy distribution for holes, pE, in the VB but pE is much larger
than nE given that this is a p-type layer. The E−k or the energy versus electron’s
crystal momentum diagram for a typical direct bandgap semiconductor (such as
GaAs) is shown in Figure 6.30c. Since the hole concentration is very large, we can
assume that the rate of recombination will depend primarily on the concentration of
injected electrons, and the electron transition probability to an empty state in the VB.
The electron concentration in the CB as a function of energy is asymmetrical,
and has a peak at 12 kT above Ec. The energy spread of these electrons is typically
about 1.8kT from Ec as in Figure 6.30b. When an electron at Ec recombines with a
hole at Ev, shown as the transition 1 in Figure 6.30c, a photon is emitted with an
energy hf1 = Ec − Ev = Eg. Since there are not many electrons and holes at the band

edges, this type of recombination does not occur frequently, and the emitted light
intensity from a type 1 transition is small.
The transitions that involve the largest electron concentration, the peak in nE, are
shown as 2 in Figure 6.30a, and emit a photon with hf2 > hf1. Such transitions occur
frequently (large nE), and hence the emitted intensity is much larger than that from 1.
Similarly, the transition marked 3, corresponding to hf3 > hf2, involves an electron
quite high up in the CB where nE is very small. Such type 3 transitions are infrequent
and lead to a small emission intensity. The emission intensity rises to a maximum
and then falls with hf as depicted in Figure 6.30d.
One might guess that the highest emitted intensity should intuitively correspond
to the transition from the peak in nE to the peak in pE in Figure 6.30b that emits
hf = Eg + kT. However, we also need to consider the conservation of momentum,
and hence the E−k diagram in Figure 6.30c. The emitted photon has a negligible
momentum, which means that an electron must fall straight down in the E−k diagram
without changing its k-vector, that is, the electron momentum ħk is conserved. As
apparent from Figure 6.30c, the E−k curvatures are different in the CB and the VB.
The electron at Ec + 12 kT cannot just recombine with the hole at Ev − 12 kT because
that transition does not satisfy the ħk-conservation. As shown in Figure 6.30c, direct
recombination involves energetic electrons spreading over several kT in the CB, more
than the holes in the VB, because the E−k curvature is narrower in the CB and
broader in the VB. It is apparent that the emission spectrum in this case is determined by nE, the energy spread in the electrons in the CB, so that the emission has
a peak at roughly Eg + 12 kT . Further, the spread Δ(hf ) in the emitted photon energies
should roughly be the spread in nE, i.e., Δ(hf ) ≈ 1.8kT.
The intuitive relative light intensity versus photon energy characteristic of the
output spectrum based on nE and the E−k diagram is shown in Figure 6.30d; it
represents an important LED characteristic. Given the spectrum in Figure 6.30d, we
can easily derive the relative light intensity versus wavelength characteristic since
λ = c∕f, which would look like Figure 6.30d, but flipped horizontally. The linewidth
of the output spectrum, Δf or Δλ, is defined as the width between half-intensity
points as depicted in Figure 6.30d; it is also called the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) spectral width.
Typical observed output spectra, i.e., the relative intensity versus wavelength
characteristics, from an LED depend not only on the semiconductor material, including dopant concentrations, but also on the structure of the device. The spectrum in
Figure 6.30d represents a highly simplified theoretical spectrum without including
the effects of heavy doping on the energy bands nor the reabsorption of photons
before they leave the device. For a heavily doped n-type semiconductor there are so
many donors that the electron wavefunctions at these donors overlap to generate a
narrow impurity band centered at Ed but extending into the conduction band. Thus,
the donor impurity band overlaps the conduction band and hence effectively lowers
Ec as described in Chapter 5. The minimum emitted photon energy from heavily
doped semiconductors is therefore less than Eg and depends on the amount of doping.
Typical output spectrum from an AlGaAs infrared (IR) LED is shown in
Figure 6.31a. It is clear that the spectrum exhibits significantly less asymmetry than
the idealized spectrum in Figure 6.30d. The width of the spectrum is about 40 nm

which corresponds to a width of about 2.9kT in the energy distribution of the emitted photons, more than the expected 1.8kT. The reasons for not observing the highly
asymmetrical theoretical spectrum are essentially two fold. First, higher energy photons become reabsorbed in the material and photogenerate electrons and holes. These
electrons and holes thermalize and end up recombining to emit photons with lower
energies, closer to Eg, thus photons become redistributed. Secondly, the band edges
Ec and Ev are not sharp in heavily doped semiconductors, which leads to the smearing
of the well-defined Eg for the emission onset.
Based on the Boltzmann distribution of electrons in the CB in Figure 6.30b, the
peak emission frequency fo and the spectral width Δf in photon energy in LEDs with
a direct bandgap active region can be written as

depends on this ΔE, and is significantly wider than 3kT that is involved in direct
recombination process in Figure 6.30c.
As the temperature increases, the change in hfo in Equation 6.39 is due primarily to the decrease in the bandgap Eg with temperature. The peak emission wavelength λo, corresponding to fo, therefore increases with temperature as shown in
Figure 6.31b. Further, the linewidth Δλ becomes longer at higher temperatures as
electrons are distributed further into the CB. Thus, a wider spectrum of photon energies are emitted as electrons and hole recombine. The dependence of the bandgap
Eg on the temperature is often described by the Varshni equation,
Eg = Ego −

AT 2
B+T

[6.41]

where Ego is the bandgap at T = 0 K, and A and B are constants that are specific to
a given material and are listed in various semiconductor handbooks.
The description of the output spectrum above essentially assumes that injected
electrons thermalize and reach an equilibrium distribution in the p-type active layer
as soon as they are injected as in Figure 6.30b. These arguments would apply to
nondegenerate semiconductors under weak injection. For degenerately doped junctions, the Fermi level EFn on the n-side and EFp on the p-side will be in the CB and
VB, respectively. Under a large forward bias, the active region can have EFn in the
CB, EFp in the VB around the junction as shown in Figure 6.32a. The bandgap Eg′
is narrower than Eg in the bulk. As shown in the E−k diagram in Figure 6.32b,
electrons occupy states from the CB edge E′c up to about ∼1.5kT above EFn. The
emission spectrum will extend from hf ≈ E′g to about E′g + ΔEFn + 1.5kT so the
spectral width in photon energy is ΔEFn + 1.5kT. This will increase with the bias
voltage as well since EFn − EFp = eV.
Figure 6.33 is a log–log plot of the spectral with Δλ of a collection of commercial LEDs as a function of the peak emission wavelength. The two lines are the
expected spectral widths from Equation 6.40 with m = 1.8 and 3. The vast majority
of direct bandgap LEDs that are not based on QWs indeed fall between the two lines.

the graph in Figure 6.34. The best line that is forced through zero to follow Equation 6.42
gives a slope of 1.95 × 10−7 nm−1 K−1 or 195 m−1 K−1. Thus,

SOLUTION

At 25 °C, T = 298 K, using the Varshni equation,
Eg = Ego − AT 2∕(B + T )
= 1.519 eV − (5.41 × 10−4 eV K−1)(298 K)2∕(204 K + 298 K) = 1.4233 eV.

The peak emission is at hfo ≈ Eg + (1∕2)kT. Using fo = c∕λo, we get

At −45 °C, T = 233 K, repeating the above calculation,
Eg = 1.519 eV − (5.41 × 10−4 eV K−1)(233 K)2∕(204 K + 233 K) = 1.4518 eV,

and the new peak emission wavelength λ′o is
λ′o =

(3 × 108 m s−1 ) (6.626 × 10−34 J s)
(1.4518 eV + 0.01004 eV) (1.602 × 10−19 J eV−1 )

= 848.8 nm

The change Δλ = λo − λ′o = 864.0 − 848.8 = 15.2 nm over 65 °C, or 0.23 nm/°C. The
examination of Figure 6.31b shows that the change in the peak wavelength per unit temperature in the range −40 °C to 85 °C is roughly the same. Because of the small change, we kept
sufficient significant figures in Eg and λo calculations.

BRIGHTNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF LEDS

The visual brightness of a light source as observed by an average person is proportional to the radiation (optical) power emitted, called the radiant flux, and also the
efficiency of the eye over the spectrum of the source. While the eye can see a red
color source, it cannot see an infrared source and the brightness of the infrared source
would be zero. It is clear that we need to define some kind of a standard sensitivity
curve for the eye as a function of wavelength. This function is the relative luminous
efficiency (or the relative sensitivity) ηeye(λ) of an average light-adapted (photopic)
eye, which depends on the wavelength and hence λ. This function is also called the
luminosity function and the visibility function. ηeye(λ) is a Gaussian-like function
with a peak of unity at 555 nm as shown in Figure 6.35. Suppose that Po is the
radiation (optical) power emitted by an LED; Po is in watts. The luminous flux Φv
is a measure of visual brightness, in lumens (lm), and is defined by
Luminous
flux

Φv = Po × (683 lm W−1) × ηeye(λ)

[6.43]

One lumen of luminous flux, or brightness, is obtained from a 1.46 mW light source
emitting at a single wavelength of 555 nm (green). A typical 60 W incandescent
lamp provides roughly 900 lm (or 15 lm W−1). When we buy a light bulb, we are
buying lumens.
The luminous efficacy12 of a light source (such as a lamp) as widely used in
lighting applications is the efficiency with which an electrical light source converts
12
Some authors use the term luminous efficiency but the latter, strictly, needs the output and input quantities to
have the same units so that the efficiency can be expressed as a percentage, which is not the case here.
Efficacy would be a better term.

A 100 W light bulb producing 1700 lumens has an efficacy of 17 lm W−1.
Recent technological advances has led to LEDs with efficacies that are comparable
to standard fluorescent tubes; efficacies around 100 lm W−1. LEDs as solid state
lamps have much longer lifetimes and much higher reliability, and hence are expected
to be more economical than incandescent and fluorescent lamps.
The power conversion efficiency (PCE), ηPCE, or simply the power efficiency,

Consider the DH LED in Figure 6.25. The current brings in the electrons into
the p-GaAs layer where they recombine with holes and emit photons. The electrons
recombine in p-GaAs through direct (radiative) and indirect (nonradiative) recombination. The latter involves recombination through defects and impurities and generates lattice waves (phonons). Suppose that τr is the mean lifetime of an electron
before it recombines radiatively and τnr is the mean lifetime before it recombines
nonradiatively via a recombination center without emitting a photon. Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is defined as

The current I is proportional to the total rate of recombination 1∕τr + 1∕τnr, the
denominator in Equation 6.47. The rate of photon generation internally is proportional to 1∕τr. Before the photons can be observed externally, they have to be
extracted. The fraction of photons that escape the device and become emitted is
called the extraction efficiency (EE),
Extraction

ηEE =

Photons emitted externally from the device

[6.48]

The rate of electron injection into the p-GaAs is I∕e. Rate of internal photon
emission is ηIQE(I∕e). Of these ηEE become extracted so the output photon flux is
ηEEηIQE(I∕e). The output optical power is
Output
radiant power

Po = hf × Photon flux = hfηEEηIQE(I∕e)

[6.49]

According to Equation 6.49, the output power is proportional to the current.
However, the IQE can also depend on the current because τr and τnr are not necessarily constant; they may depend on the injected carrier concentration and hence on
the current. Typical optical output power Po versus current I LED characteristics are
shown in Figure 6.36 on a log–log plot for three cases. For comparison, the expected
linear relationship, Po ∝ I, has been also shown for each device. In general, at high
currents, Po−I relationship curves down from the expected Po ∝ I (linear) behavior.
The worst case is for InGaN MQW LEDs in which there is significant deviation
from the expected linear relationship almost from the start, that is, Po cannot keep
up linearly with the current and droops as the current increases. The Po−I characteristics for standard AlGaInP and AlGaAs heterojunction LEDs deviate from linearity mainly at high currents, exhibiting an extensive range of reasonable linearity.
While a non-linear Po−I behavior is not a serious problem in digital communications,
it can create distortion in analog modulation, especially under large signals.
We can view the LED as converting quanta of charge (electrons) brought in by
the current to emitted quanta of radiation energy (photons). External quantum

EXAMPLE 6.14

SOLUTION

For the red LED, at λ = 650 nm, Figure 6.35 gives ηeye ≈ 0.10 so that from Equation 6.43
Φv = Po × (683 lm W−1) × ηeye = (20 × 10−3 W)(683 lm W−1)(0.10) = 1.37 lm

For the green LED, at λ = 530 nm, Figure 6.35 gives ηeye ≈ 0.85 so that from Equation 6.43
Φv = Po × (683 lm W−1) × ηeye = (5 × 10−3 W)(683 lm W−1)(0.85) = 2.9 lm

Clearly the green LED at a quarter of the power is more than twice as bright as the red LED.

and has an acceptor concentration Na of 2 × 1017 cm−3. The nonradiative lifetime is about

optical power is 7.5 mW. Calculate the IQE, EQE, PCE, and estimate the light extraction
efficiency. For GaAs, the radiative lifetime in the p-GaAs layer can be written as τr = 1∕BNa

SOLAR CELLS

6.10.1 PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICE PRINCIPLES
A simplified schematic diagram of a typical solar cell is shown in Figure 6.37.
Consider a pn junction with a very narrow and more heavily doped n-region. The
illumination is through the thin n-side. The depletion region (W) or the space charge
layer (SCL) extends primarily into the p-side. There is a built-in field Eo in this
depletion layer. The electrodes attached to the n-side must allow illumination to enter
the device and at the same time result in a small series resistance. They are deposited on the n-side to form an array of finger electrodes on the surface as depicted
in Figure 6.38. A thin antireflection coating on the surface (not shown in the figure)
reduces reflections and allows more light to enter the device.

As the n-side is very narrow, most of the photons are absorbed within the depletion region (W) and within the neutral p-side (ℓp) and photogenerate EHPs in these
regions. EHPs photogenerated in the depletion region are immediately separated by
the built-in field Eo which drifts them apart. The electron drifts and reaches the
neutral n-side whereupon it makes this region negative by an amount of charge −e.
The actual reason the n-side becomes negative is that the excess electron that drifts
into the n-side shields a positive donor charge at the depletion region edge. This
changes the built-in field Eo and hence the built-in voltage, and it is this change that
is observed externally. Remember that in the dark, the voltage across the terminals
of the pn junction is zero because the built-in voltage Vo is canceled by contact
potentials between the metal and the semiconductor at the two contacts. If we upset
this equilibrium by changing Vo, we can register an external voltage. Similarly, the
hole drifts and reaches the neutral p-side and thereby makes this side positive.
Consequently a net open circuit voltage develops between the terminals of the device
with the p-side positive with respect to the n-side. If an external load is connected,
then the excess electron in the n-side can travel around the external circuit, do work,
and reach the p-side to recombine with the excess hole there. It is important to realize that without the internal field Eo it is not possible to drift apart the photogenerated
EHPs and bring excess electrons to the n-side and excess holes to the p-side.

588

CHAPTER 6

∙

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

The EHPs photogenerated by long-wavelength photons that are absorbed in the
neutral p-side diffuse around in this region as there is no electric field. If the recombination lifetime of the electron is τe, it diffuses a mean distance Le = √2Deτe where
De is its diffusion coefficient in the p-side. Those electrons within a distance Le to
the depletion region can readily diffuse and reach this region whereupon they become
drifted by Eo to the n-side as shown in Figure 6.37. Consequently only those EHPs
photogenerated within the minority carrier diffusion length Le to the depletion layer
can contribute to the photovoltaic effect. Again the importance of the built-in field
Eo is apparent. Once an electron diffuses to the depletion region, it is swept over to
the n-side by Eo to give an additional negative charge there. Holes left behind in the
p-side contribute a net positive charge to this region. Those photogenerated EHPs
further away from the depletion region than Le are lost by recombination. It is therefore
important to have the minority carrier diffusion length Le be as long as possible.
This is the reason for choosing this side of a Si pn junction to be p-type which makes
electrons the minority carriers; the electron diffusion length in Si is longer than the
hole diffusion length. The same ideas also apply to EHPs photogenerated by shortwavelength photons absorbed in the n-side. Those holes photogenerated within a
diffusion length Lh can reach the depletion layer and become swept across to the
p-side. The photogeneration of EHPs that contributes to the photovoltaic effect therefore occurs in a volume covering Lh + W + Le. If the terminals of the device are
shorted, as in Figure 6.39, then the photogenerated electrons that are drifted into the
n-side can flow through the external circuit to neutralize the photogenerated holes
that have drifted into the p-side. This current due to the flow of the photogenerated
carriers is called the photocurrent.
Under a steady-state operation, there can be no net current through an open
circuit solar cell. This means the photocurrent inside the device due to the flow of
photogenerated carriers must be exactly balanced by a flow of carriers in the opposite direction. The latter carriers are minority carriers that become injected by the
appearance of the photovoltaic voltage across the pn junction as in a normal diode.
This is not shown in Figure 6.37.

EHPs photogenerated by energetic photons absorbed in the n-side near the surface region or outside the diffusion length Lh to the depletion layer are lost by
recombination as the lifetime in the n-side is generally very short (due to heavy
doping). The n-side is therefore made very thin, typically less than 0.2 μm. Indeed,
the length ℓn of the n-side may be shorter than the hole diffusion length Lh. The
EHPs photogenerated very near the surface of the n-side, however, disappear by
recombination due to various surface defects acting as recombination centers as
discussed below.
At long wavelengths, around 1–1.2 μm, the absorption coefficient α of Si is
small and the absorption depth (1∕α) is typically greater than 100 μm. To capture
these long-wavelength photons, we therefore need a thick p-side and at the same
time a long minority carrier diffusion length Le. Typically the p-side is 200–500 μm
and Le tends to be shorter than this.
Crystalline silicon has a bandgap of 1.1 eV which corresponds to a threshold
wavelength of 1.1 μm. The incident energy in the wavelength region greater than
1.1 μm is then wasted; this is not a negligible amount (∼25 percent). The worst part
of the efficiency limitation however comes from the high-energy photons becoming
absorbed near the crystal surface and being lost by recombination in the surface
region. Crystal surfaces and interfaces contain a high concentration of recombination
centers which facilitate the recombination of photogenerated EHPs near the surface.
Losses due to EHP recombinations near or at the surface can be as high as 40 percent.
These combined effects bring the efficiency down to about 45 percent. In addition,
the antireflection coating is not perfect, which reduces the total collected photons by
a factor of about 0.8–0.9. When we also include the limitations of the photovoltaic
action itself (discussed below), the upper limit to a photovoltaic device that uses a
single crystal of Si is about 24–26 percent at room temperature.
Consider an ideal pn junction photovoltaic device connected to a resistive load
R as shown in Figure 6.40a. Note that I and V in the figure define the convention
for the direction of positive current and positive voltage. If the load is a short circuit,
then the only current in the circuit is that generated by the incident light. This is the

photogenerated within the volume enclosing the depletion region (W) and the diffusion lengths to the depletion region (Figure 6.39). The greater is the light intensity,
the higher is the photogeneration rate and the larger is Iph. If I is the light intensity,
then the short circuit current is
Isc = −Iph = −KI

[6.51]

where K is a constant that depends on the particular device. The photocurrent does
not depend on the voltage across the pn junction because there is always some internal field to drift the photogenerated EHP. We exclude the secondary effect of the
voltage modulating the width of the depletion region. The photocurrent Iph therefore
flows even when there is not a voltage across the device.
If R is not a short circuit, then a positive voltage V appears across the pn junction as a result of the current passing through it as shown in Figure 6.40c. This
voltage reduces the built-in potential of the pn junction and hence leads to minority
carrier injection and diffusion just as it would in a normal diode. Thus, in addition
to Iph there is also a forward diode current Id in the circuit as shown in Figure 6.40c
which arises from the voltage developed across R. Since Id is due to the normal pn
junction behavior, it is given by the diode characteristics,
Id = Io[ exp(

eV
− 1]
ηkT )

where Io is the “reverse saturation current” and η is the ideality factor (η = 1−2).
In an open circuit, the net current is zero. This means that the photocurrent Iph
develops just enough photovoltaic voltage Voc to generate a diode current Id = Iph.
Thus the total current through the solar cell, as shown in Figure 6.40c, is

I = −Iph + Io[ exp(

[6.52]

The overall I–V characteristics of a typical Si solar cell are shown in Figure 6.41.
It can be seen that it corresponds to the normal dark characteristics being shifted
down by the photocurrent Iph, which depends on the light intensity I. The open
circuit output voltage Voc, of the solar cell is given by the point where the I–V curve
cuts the V axis (I = 0). It is apparent that although it depends on the light intensity,
its value typically lies in the range 0.5–0.7 V.
Equation 6.52 gives the I–V characteristics of the solar cell. When the solar cell
is connected to a load as in Figure 6.42a, the load has the same voltage as the solar
cell and carries the same current. But the current I through R is now in the opposite
direction to the convention that current flows from high to low potential. Thus, as
shown in Figure 6.42a,

The actual current I′ and voltage V′ in the circuit must satisfy both the I–V
characteristics of the solar cell, Equation 6.52, and that of the load, Equation 6.53.
We can find I′ and V′ by solving these two equations simultaneously or using a

graphical solution. I′ and V′ in the solar cell circuit are most easily found by using
a load line construction. The I–V characteristics of the load in Equation 6.53 is a
straight line with a negative slope −1∕R. This is called the load line and is shown
in Figure 6.42b along with the I–V characteristics of the solar cell under a given
intensity of illumination. The load line cuts the solar cell characteristic at P where
the load and the solar cell have the same current and voltage I′ and V′. Point P
therefore satisfies both Equations 6.52 and 6.53 and thus represents the operating
point of the circuit.
The power delivered to the load is Pout = I′V′, which is the area of the rectangle bound by the I and V axes and the dashed lines shown in Figure 6.42b.

Maximum power is delivered to the load when this rectangular area is maximized
(by changing R or the intensity of illumination), when I′ = Im and V′ = Vm. Since
the maximum possible current is Isc and the maximum possible voltage is Voc, IscVoc
represents the desirable goal in power delivery for a given solar cell. Therefore, it
makes sense to compare the maximum power output ImVm with IscVoc. The fill factor
FF, which is a figure of merit for the solar cell, is defined as

[6.54]

The FF is a measure of the closeness of the solar cell I–V curve to the rectangular shape (the ideal shape). It is clearly advantageous to have the FF as close to
unity as possible, but the exponential pn junction properties prevent this. Typically
FF values are in the range 70–85 percent and depend on the device material and
structure.
EXAMPLE 6.16

A SOLAR CELL DRIVING A RESISTIVE LOAD Consider the solar cell in Figure 6.42 that

is driving a load of 3 Ω. This cell has an area of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm and is illuminated with
light of intensity 700 W m−2. Find the current and voltage in the circuit. Find the power delivered
to the load, the efficiency of the solar cell in this circuit, and the fill factor of the solar cell.

SOLUTION

The I–V characteristic of the load in Figure 6.42a, is the load line in Equation 6.53; that is,
I = −V∕(3 Ω). The line is drawn in Figure 6.42b with a slope 1∕(3 Ω). It cuts the I–V characteristics of the solar cell at I′ = 157 mA and V′ = 0.475 V as apparent in Figure 6.42b,
which are the current and voltage, respectively, in the photovoltaic circuit of Figure 6.42a.
The power delivered to the load is
Pout = I′V′ = (157 × 10−3)(0.475 V) = 0.0746 W

or

74.6 mW

The input of sunlight power is

The efficiency is

This will increase if the load is adjusted to extract the maximum power from the solar
cell, but the increase will be small as the rectangular area I′V′ in Figure 6.42b is already
quite close to the maximum.
The fill factor can also be calculated since point P in Figure 6.42b is close to the optimum operation, maximum output power, in which the rectangular area I′V′ is maximum:

6.10.2 SERIES AND SHUNT RESISTANCE
Practical solar cells can deviate substantially from the ideal pn junction solar cell
behavior depicted in Figure 6.41 due to a number of reasons. Consider an illuminated
pn junction driving a load resistance RL and assume that photogeneration takes place
in the depletion region. As shown in Figure 6.43, the photogenerated electrons have

to traverse a surface semiconductor region to reach the nearest finger electrode. All
these electron paths in the n-layer surface region to finger electrodes introduce an
effective series resistance Rs into the photovoltaic circuit. If the finger electrodes
are thin, then the resistance of the electrodes themselves will further increase Rs.
There is also a series resistance due to the neutral p-region, but this is generally
small compared with the resistance of the electron paths to the finger electrodes.
Figure 6.44a shows the equivalent circuit of an ideal pn junction solar cell. The
photogeneration process is represented by a constant current generator Iph, which generates a current that is proportional to the light intensity. The flow of photogenerated
carriers across the junction gives rise to a photovoltaic voltage difference V across the
junction, and this voltage leads to the normal diode current Id = Io[exp(eV∕ηkT) − 1].
This diode current Id is represented by an ideal pn junction diode in the circuit as
shown in Figure 6.44a. As apparent, Iph and Id are in opposite directions (Iph is “up”
and Id is “down”), so in an open circuit the photovoltaic voltage is such that Iph and
Id have the same magnitude and cancel each other. By convention, positive current
I at the output terminal is normally taken to flow into the terminal and is given by
Equation 6.52. (In reality, of course, the solar cell current is negative, as in Figure
6.41, which represents a current that is flowing out into the load.)
Figure 6.44b shows the equivalent circuit of a more practical solar cell. The
series resistance Rs in Figure 6.44b gives rise to a voltage drop and therefore prevents the ideal photovoltaic voltage from developing at the output between A and B
when a current is drawn. A fraction (usually small) of the photogenerated carriers
can also flow through the crystal surfaces (edges of the device) or through grain
boundaries in polycrystalline devices instead of flowing though the external load RL.
These effects that prevent photogenerated carriers from flowing in the external circuit
can be represented by an effective internal shunt or parallel resistance Rp that
diverts the photocurrent away from the load RL. Typically Rp is less important than
Rs in overall device behavior, unless the device is highly polycrystalline and the
current component flowing through grain boundaries is not negligible.
The series resistance Rs can significantly deteriorate the solar cell performance
as illustrated in Figure 6.45 where Rs = 0 is the best solar cell case. It is apparent

that the available maximum output power decreases with the series resistance which
therefore reduces the cell efficiency. Notice also that when Rs is sufficiently large,
it limits the short circuit current. Similarly, low shunt resistance values, due to extensive defects in the material, also reduce the efficiency. The difference is that although
Rs does not affect the open circuit voltage Voc, low Rp leads to a reduced Voc.

6.10.3

SOLAR CELL MATERIALS, DEVICES, AND EFFICIENCIES

Most solar cells use crystalline silicon because silicon-based semiconductor fabrication is now a mature technology that enables cost-effective devices to be manufactured. Typical Si-based solar cell efficiencies range from about 18 percent for
polycrystalline to 22–25 percent in high-efficiency single-crystal devices that have
special structures to absorb as many of the incident photons as possible. Solar cells
fabricated by making a pn junction in the same crystal are called homojunctions. The
best Si homojunction solar cell efficiencies are about 25 percent for single-crystal
passivated emitter, rear locally diffused (PERL) cells.13 The PERL and similar cells
have a textured surface that is an array of “inverted pyramids” etched into the surface
to capture as much of the incoming light as possible as depicted in Figure 6.46.

Normal reflections from a flat crystal surface lead to a loss of light, whereas reflections inside the pyramid allow a second or even a third chance for absorption. Further,
after refraction, photons would be entering the semiconductor at oblique angles which
means that they will be absorbed in the useful photogeneration volume, that is, within
the electron diffusion length of the depletion layer as shown in Figure 6.46.
Table 6.5 summarizes some typical characteristics of various solar cells. GaAs
and Si solar cells have comparable efficiencies though theoretically GaAs with a
higher bandgap is supposed to have a better efficiency. The largest factors reducing
the efficiency of a Si solar cell are the unabsorbed photons with hf < Eg and short
wavelength photons absorbed near the surface. Both these factors are improved if
tandem cell structures or heterojunctions are used.
There are a number of III–V semiconductor alloys that can be prepared with different bandgaps but with the same lattice constant. Heterojunctions (junctions between
different materials) from these semiconductors have negligible interface defects. AlGaAs
has a wider bandgap than GaAs and would allow most solar photons to pass through.
If we use a thin AlGaAs layer on a GaAs pn junction then this layer passivates the
surface defects normally present in a homojunction GaAs cell. The AlGaAs window
layer therefore overcomes the surface recombination limitation and improves the cell
efficiency (such cells have efficiencies of about 24 percent).
Tandem solar cells, which are also called multijunction solar cells, are high
efficiency heterostructure based devices, which use two or more cells in tandem, or
in cascade. Figure 6.47a shows a typical two-cell tandem solar cell. The first cell is

made from a wider bandgap material and only absorbs photons with hf > Eg1. A
good example is the III–V alloy GaInP2 (or Ga0.5In0.5P), which has Eg1 ≈ 1.9 eV.
The second cell absorbs photons (hf < Eg1) that pass through the first cell and have
hf > Eg2. This could be GaAs with Eg2 ≈ 1.4 eV. The whole structure can be grown
by using lattice matched crystalline layers on a suitable substrate, leading to a monolithic tandem cell. The two cells have to be connected, that is, allow the carriers
(electrons and holes) to pass. This is done by using a highly doped very thin p+n+
junction between the two cells that serves as a tunneling junction. Since both p+ and
n+ sides are very heavily doped (degenerate), the depletion layer width is very narrow and the carriers simply tunnel through it.14 All the layers are grown by special
techniques on a single substrate.
One of the best efficiencies is achieved by using a three junction solar cell,
which is illustrated in Figure 6.47b. The layers are all grown epitaxially on a Ge
substrate. Each cell is an np junction and functions as a solar cell. There are two
very thin p+n+ tunnel junctions that connect the cells in tandem as shown in Figure
6.47b, to allow the drifting carriers tunnel (pass) through. The top cell is GaInP2
with Eg ≈ 1.9 eV (corresponding bandgap wavelength λg = 0.65 μm), the second is
GaAs with Eg ≈ 1.42 eV (λg = 0.87 μm) and the third is Ge with Eg ≈ 0.66 eV (λg =
0.19 μm). The three cells have a wide spectral range and are able to capture a very
high percentage of the incident solar radiation. The multijunction solar cell in Figure
6.47b is commercially available with an efficiency of 32 percent. Even higher efficiencies have been reported in research labs using such multijunction heterostructures. If, in addition, light concentrators are also used, the efficiency can be further
increased.
Tandem cells are also used in inexpensive thin film a-Si:H (hydrogenated amorphous silicon) pin solar cells to obtain efficiencies up to about 11−12 percent. These
tandem cells have a-Si:H and a-SiGe:H cells and are readily fabricated in large areas
14
In a tunnel diode, which is a degenerately doped p+n+ junction, even a tiny voltage allows electrons to tunnel
through the depletion region in both forward and reverse bias conditions. The current flows through quite
easily. It is like carriers tunneling in Zener breakdown in Figure 6.22 with zero reverse bias or forward bias.

as discussed in Chapter 1. Amorphous Si:H has an Eg of about 1.8 eV. The alloying
of a-Si:H with Ge to produce a-SiGe:H decreases Eg. Further, Eg of a-SiGe:H can
be graded by controlling the Ge content.

BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR (BJT)

6.11.1 COMMON BASE (CB) DC CHARACTERISTICS
As an example, we will consider the pnp bipolar junction transistor (BJT) whose
basic structure is shown in Figure 6.48a. The pnp transistor has three differently
doped semiconductor regions. These regions of different doping occur within the
same single crystal by the variation of acceptor and donor concentrations resulting
from the fabrication process. The most heavily doped p-region (p+) is called the
emitter. In contact with this region is the lightly doped n-region, which is called the
base. The next region is the p-type doped collector. The base region has the most
narrow width for reasons discussed below. Although the three regions in Figure 6.48a
have identical cross-sectional areas, in practice, due to the fabrication process, the
cross-sectional area increases from the emitter to the collector and the collector
region has an extended width. For simplicity, we will assume that the cross-sectional
area is uniform, as in Figure 6.48a.

CHAPTER 6

∙

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

The pnp BJT connected as shown in Figure 6.48b is said to be operating under
normal and active conditions, which means that the base–emitter (BE) junction is
forward biased and the base–collector (BC) junction is reverse biased. The circuit in
Figure 6.48b, in which the base is common to both the collector and emitter bias
voltages, is known as the common base (CB) configuration.15 Figure 6.48c shows
the CB transistor circuit with the BJT represented by its circuit symbol. The arrow
identifies the emitter junction and points in the direction of current flow when the
EB junction is forward biased. Figure 6.48c also identifies the emitter circuit, where
VEB is connected, as the input circuit. The collector circuit, where VCB is connected,
is the output circuit.
The base–emitter junction is simply called the emitter junction and the basecollector junction is called the collector junction. As the emitter is heavily doped,
the base–emitter depletion region WEB extends almost entirely into the base. Generally, the base and collector regions have comparable doping, so the base–collector
depletion region WBC extends to both sides. The width of the neutral base region
outside the depletion regions is labeled as WB. All these parameters are shown and
defined in Figure 6.48b.
We should note that all the applied voltages drop across the depletion widths.
The applied collector–base voltage VCB reverse biases the BC junction and hence
increases the field in the depletion region at the collector junction.
Since the EB junction is forward biased, minority carriers are then injected into
the emitter and base exactly as they are in the forward-biased diode. Holes are
injected into the base and electrons into the emitter, as depicted in Figure 6.48d.
Hole injection into the base, however, far exceeds the electron injection into the
emitter because the emitter is heavily doped. We can then assume that the emitter
current is almost entirely due to holes injected from the emitter into the base. Thus,
when forward biased, the emitter “emits,” that is, injects holes into the base.
Injected holes into the base must diffuse toward the collector junction because
there is a hole concentration gradient in the base. Hole concentration pn(WB) just
outside the depletion region at the collector junction is negligibly small because the
increased field sweeps nearly all the holes here across the junction into the collector
(the collector junction is reverse biased).
The hole concentration pn(0) in the base just outside the emitter junction depletion region is given by the law of the junction. Measuring x from this point
(Figure 6.48b),
eVEB
[6.55]
pn (0) = pno exp(
kT )
whereas at the collector end, x = WB, pn(WB) ≈ 0.
If no holes are lost by recombination in the base, then all the injected holes
diffuse to the collector junction. There is no field in the base to drift the holes. Their
motion is by diffusion. When they reach the collector junction, they are quickly swept
across into the collector by the internal field E in WBC. It is apparent that all the
injected holes from the emitter become collected by the collector. The collector
15

CB should not be confused with the conduction band abbreviation.

6 .1 1

current is then the same as the emitter current. The only difference is that the emitter
current flows across a smaller voltage difference VEB, whereas the collector current
flows through a larger voltage difference VCB. This means a net gain in power from
the emitter (input) circuit to the collector (output) circuit.
Since the current in the base is by diffusion, to evaluate the emitter and collector currents we must know the hole concentration gradient at x = 0 and x = WB
and therefore we must know the hole concentration profile pn(x) across the base.16
In the first instance, we can approximate the pn(x) profile in the base as a straight
line from pn(0) to pn(WB) = 0, as shown in Figure 6.48b. This is only true in the
absence of any recombination in the base as in the short diode case. The emitter

It is apparent that IE is determined by VEB, the forward bias applied across the
EB junction, and the base width WB. In the absence of recombination, the collector
current is the same as the emitter current, IC = IE. The control of the collector current IC in the output (collector) circuit by VEB in the input (emitter) circuit is what
constitutes the transistor action. The common base circuit has a power gain because
IC in the output in Figure 6.48c flows around a larger voltage difference VCB compared with IE in the input, which flows across VEB (about 0.6 V).
The ratio of the collector current IC to the emitter current IE is defined as the
CB current gain or current transfer ratio α of the transistor,
α=

[6.57]

Definition of
CB current
gain

Typically, α is less than unity, in the range 0.990–0.999, due to two reasons. First
is the limitation due to the emitter injection efficiency. When the BE junction is
forward biased, holes are injected from the emitter into the base, giving an emitter
current IE(hole), and electrons are injected from the base into the emitter, giving an
emitter current IE(electron). The total emitter current is, therefore,
IE = IE(hole) + IE(electron)

Only the holes injected into the base are useful in giving a collector current because
only they can reach the collector. The emitter injection efficiency is defined as

Consequently, the collector current, which depends on IE(hole) only, is less than the
emitter current. We would like γ to be as close to unity as possible; IE(hole) ≫ IE(electron).
γ can be readily calculated for the forward-biased pn junction current equations as
shown in Example 6.19.
Secondly, a small number of the diffusing holes in the narrow base inevitably
become lost by recombination with the large number of electrons present in this
region as depicted in Figure 6.48d. Thus, a fraction of IE(hole) is lost in the base due
to recombination, which further reduces the collector current. We define the base
transport factor αT as

αT =

IE(hole) γIE

[6.59]

If the emitter were a perfect injector, IE = IE(hole), then the current gain α would
be αT. If τh is the hole (minority carrier) lifetime in the base, then 1∕τh is the probability per unit time that a hole will recombine and disappear. We also know that in
time t, a particle diffuses a distance x, given by x = √2Dt where D is the diffusion
coefficient. The time τt it takes for a hole to diffuse across WB is then given by
Base minority

time

τt =

[6.60]

This diffusion time is called the transit time of the minority carriers across the base.
The probability of recombination in time τt is then τt∕τh. The probability of not
recombining and therefore diffusing across is (1 − τt∕τh). Since IE(hole) represents the
holes entering the base per unit time, IE(hole)(1 − τt∕τh) represents the number of holes
leaving the base per unit time (without recombining) which is the collector current
IC. Substituting for IC and IE(hole) in Equation 6.59 gives the base transport factor αT,

The recombination of holes with electrons in the base means that the base must
be replenished with electrons, which are supplied by the external battery in the form
of a small base current IB, as shown in Figure 6.48d. In addition, the base current
also has to supply the electrons injected from the base into the emitter, that is,
IE(electron), and shown as electron diffusion in the emitter in Figure 6.48d. The number
of holes entering the base per unit time is represented by IE(hole), and the number
recombining per unit time is then IE(hole)(τt∕τh). Thus, IB is

which further simplifies to IE − IC; the difference between the emitter current and

current law.)

The base–collector junction in Figure 6.48b is reverse biased, which leads to a
leakage current into the collector terminal even in the absence of an emitter current.
This leakage current is due to thermally generated EHPs in the depletion region WBC
being drifted by the internal field, as schematically illustrated in Figure 6.48d. Suppose that we open circuit the emitter (IE = 0). Then the collector current is simply
the leakage current, denoted by ICBO. The base current is then −ICBO (flowing out
from the base terminal). In the presence of an emitter current IE, we have
IC = αIE + ICBO

[6.65]

IB = (1 − α)IE − ICBO

[6.66]

Equations 6.65 and 6.66 give the collector and base currents in terms of the
input current IE, which in turn depends on VEB. They only hold when the collector
junction is reverse biased and the emitter junction is forward biased, which is defined
as the active region of the BJT. It should be emphasized that what constitutes the
transistor action is the control of IE, and hence IC, by VEB.
The dc characteristics of the CB-connected BJT as in Figure 6.48b are normally
represented by plotting the collector current IC as a function of VCB for various fixed
values of the emitter current. A typical example of such dc characteristics for a pnp
transistor is illustrated in Figure 6.49. The following characteristics are apparent. The
collector current when IE = 0 is the CB junction leakage current ICBO, typically a
fraction of a microampere. As long as the collector is negatively biased with respect
to the base, the CB junction is reverse biased and the collector current is given by

IC = αIE + ICBO, which is close to the emitter current when IE ≫ ICBO. When the
polarity of VCB is changed, the CB junction becomes forward biased. The collector
junction is then like a forward-biased diode and the collector current is the difference
between the forward-biased CB junction current and the forward-biased EB junction
current. As they are in opposite directions, they subtract.
We note that IC increases slightly with the magnitude of VCB even when IE is
constant. In our treatment above IC did not directly depend on VCB, which simply
reverse biased the collector junction to collect the diffusing holes. In our discussions
we assumed that the base width WB does not depend on VCB. This is only approximately true. Suppose that we increase the reverse bias VCB (for example, from −5 to
−10 V). Then the base–collector depletion width WBC also increases, as schematically
depicted in Figure 6.50. Consequently the base width WB gets slightly narrower,
which leads to a slightly shorter base transit time τt. The base transport factor αT in
Equation 6.61 and hence α are then slightly larger, which leads to a small increase
in IC. The modulation of the base width WB by VCB is not very strong, which means
that the slopes of the IC versus VCB lines at a fixed IE are very small in Figure 6.49.
The base width modulation by VCB is called the Early effect.

drift mobility in the base is 400 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron drift mobility in the emitter
is 200 cm2 V−1 s−1. The transistor emitter and base neutral region widths are about 2 μm
each when the transistor is under normal operating conditions, that is, when the EB junction
is forward biased and the BC junction is reverse biased. The effective cross-sectional area of
the device is 0.02 mm2. The hole lifetime in the base is approximately 400 ns. Assume that
the emitter has 100 percent injection efficiency, γ = 1. Calculate the CB current transfer ratio

The major assumption is γ = 1, which is generally not true, as shown in Example 6.19.
The actual α and hence β will be smaller due to less than 100 percent emitter injection. Note
also that WB is the neutral region width, that is, the region of base outside the depletion
regions. It is not difficult to calculate the depletion layer widths within the base, which are
about 0.2 μm on the emitter side and roughly about 0.7 μm on the collector side, so that the
total base width junction to junction is 2 + 0.2 + 0.7 = 2.9 μm.
The transit time of minority carriers across the base is τt. If the input signal changes
before the minority carriers have diffused across the base, then the collector current cannot
respond to the changes in the input. Thus, if the frequency of the input signal is greater than
1∕τt, the minority carriers will not have time to transit the base and the collector current will
remain unmodulated by the input signal. One can set the upper frequency limit at ∼1∕τt which
is 518 MHz.

How would you modify the CB current gain α to include the emitter injection efficiency?
Calculate the emitter injection efficiency for the pnp transistor in Example 6.18, which
has an acceptor doping of 2 × 1018 cm−3 in the emitter, donor doping of 1 × 1016 cm−3
in the base, emitter and base neutral region widths of 2 μm, and a minority carrier lifetime of 400 ns in the base. What are its α and β taking into account the emitter injection
efficiency?

SOLUTION

When the BE junction is forward biased, holes are injected into the base, giving an emitter
current IE(hole), and electrons are injected into the emitter, giving an emitter current IE(electron).
The total emitter current is therefore
IE = IE(hole) + IE(electron)

Only the holes injected into the base are useful in giving a collector current because only
they can reach the collector. Injection efficiency is defined as

and the overall β is

The same transistor with 100 percent emitter injection in Example 6.18 had a β of 206.
It is clear that the emitter injection efficiency γ and the base transport factor αT have comparable
impacts in controlling the overall gain in this example. We neglected the recombination of
electrons and holes in the EB depletion region. In fact, if we were to also consider this
recombination component of the emitter current, IE(hole) would have to be even smaller compared with the total IE, which would make γ and hence β even lower.

6.11.2 COMMON BASE AMPLIFIER
According to Equation 6.56 the emitter current depends exponentially on VEB,
eVEB
IE = IEO exp
( kT )

[6.67]

It is therefore apparent that small changes in VEB lead to large changes in IE. Since
IC ≈ IE, we see that small variations in VEB cause large changes in IC in the collector circuit. This can be fruitfully used to obtain voltage amplification as shown in
Figure 6.51. The battery VCC, through RC, provides a reverse bias for the base–
collector junction. The dc voltage VEE forward biases the EB junction, which means
that it provides a dc current IE. The input signal is the ac voltage veb applied in series
with the dc bias voltage VEE to the EB junction. The applied signal veb modulates
the total voltage VEB across the EB junction and hence, by virtue of Equation 6.55,
modulates the injected hole concentration pn(0) up and down about the dc value
determined by VEE as depicted in Figure 6.51. This variation in pn(0) alters the concentration gradient and therefore gives rise to a change in IE, and hence a nearly
identical change in IC. The change in the collector current can be converted to a
voltage change by using a resistor RC in the collector circuit as shown in Figure 6.51.
However, the output is commonly taken between the collector, and the base and this
voltage VCB is
VCB = −VCC + RC IC
Increasing the emitter–base voltage VEB (by increasing veb) increases IC, which
increases VCB. Since we are interested in ac signals, that voltage variation across CB
is tapped out through a dc blocking capacitor in Figure 6.51.

pn(0). The solid line shows pn(x) when only the dc bias VEE is present. The dashed lines
show how pn(x) is modulated up and down by the signal veb superimposed on VEE.

For simplicity we will assume that changes δVEB and δIE in the dc values of VEB
and IE are small, which means that δVEB and δIE can be related by differentiating
Equation 6.67. We are hence tacitly assuming an operation under small signals.
Further, we will take the changes to represent the ac signal magnitudes, veb = δVEB,
ie = δIE, ic = δIC ≈ δIE ≈ ie, vcb = δVCB.
The output signal voltage vcb corresponds to the change in VCB,
vcb = δVCB = RC δIC = RC δIE

The variation in the emitter current δIE depends on the variation δVEB in VEB,
which can be determined by differentiating Equation 6.67,
δIE

By definition, δVEB is the input signal veb. The change δIE in IE is the input

To obtain a voltage gain we obviously need RC > re, which is invariably the case by
the appropriate choice of IE, hence re, and RC. For example, when the BJT is biased so
that IE is 10 mA and re is 2.5 Ω, and if RC is chosen to be 50 Ω, then the gain is 20.
Consider a pnp Si BJT that has been connected as in Figure 6.51. The BJT has a β = 135 and has been biased to operate with a 10 mA collector
current. What is the small-signal input resistance? What is the required RC that will provide
a voltage gain of 100? What is the base current? What should be the VCC in Figure 6.51?
Suppose VCC = −6 V, what is the largest swing in the output voltage VCB in Figure 6.51 as
the input signal is increased and decreased about the bias point VEE, taken as 0.65 V?

A COMMON BASE AMPLIFIER

SOLUTION

The emitter and collector currents are approximately the same. From Equation 6.68,
re =

The voltage gain AV from Equation 6.69 is

so a gain of 100 requires RC = 250 Ω.

or

74 μA

There is a dc voltage across RC given by IC RC = (0.010 A)(250 Ω) = 2.5 V. VCC has to
provide the latter voltage across RC and also a sufficient voltage to keep the BC junction
reverse biased at all times under normal operation. Let us set VCC = −6 V. Thus, in the
absence of any input signal veb, VCB is set to −6 V + 2.5 V = −3.5 V. As we increase the
signal veb, VEB and hence IC increase until the collector point C becomes nearly zero,18 that
is, VCB = 0, which occurs when IC is maximum at ICmax = ∣VCC∣∕RC or 24 mA. As veb
decreases, so does VEB and hence IC. Eventually IC will simply become zero, and point C will
be at −6 V, so VCB = VCC. Thus, VCB can only swing from −3.5 V to 0 V (for increasing
input until IC = ICmax), or from −3.5 to −6 V (for decreasing input until IC = 0).

6.11.3 COMMON EMITTER (CE) DC CHARACTERISTICS
An npn bipolar transistor when connected in the common emitter (CE) configuration
has the emitter common to both the input and output circuits, as shown in Figure
6.52a. The dc voltage VBE forward biases the BE junction and thereby injects electrons as minority carriers into the base. These electrons diffuse to the collector
junction where the field E sweeps them into the collector to constitute the collector
current IC. VBE controls the current IE and hence IB and IC. The advantage of the CE
configuration is that the input current is the current flowing between the ac source
and the base, which is the base current IB. This current is much smaller than the
18

Various saturation effects are ignored in this approximate discussion.

between VCE and the collector, which is IC. In the CE configuration, the dc voltage
VCE must be greater than VBE to reverse bias the collector junction and collect the
diffusing electrons in the base.
The dc characteristics of the BJT in the CE configuration are normally given as
IC versus VCE for various values of fixed base currents IB, as shown in Figure 6.52b.
The characteristics can be readily understood by Equations 6.65 and 6.66. We should
note that, in practice, we are essentially adjusting VBE to obtain the desired IB because,
by Equation 6.66,
IB = (1 − α)IE − ICBO
and IE depends on VBE via Equation 6.67.
Increasing IB requires increasing VBE, which increases IC. Using Equations 6.65

is the leakage current into the collector when the base is open circuited. This is much
larger in the CE circuit than in the CB configuration.
Even when IB is kept constant, IC still exhibits a small increase with VCE, which,
according to Equation 6.70 indicates an increase in the current gain β with VCE. This

6 .1 1

BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR (BJT)

611

is due to the Early effect or modulation of the base width by VCB, shown in Figure 6.50.
Increasing VCE increases VCB, which increases WBC, reduces WB, and hence shortens
τt. The resulting effect is a larger β (≈ τh∕τt).
When VCE is less than VBE, the collector junction becomes forward biased and
Equation 6.70 is not valid. The collector current is then the difference between forward currents of emitter and collector junctions. The transistor operating in this
region is said to be saturated.

6.11.4 LOW-FREQUENCY SMALL-SIGNAL MODEL
The npn bipolar transistor in the CE (common emitter) amplifier configuration is
shown in Figure 6.53. The input circuit has a dc bias VBB to forward bias the base–
emitter (BE) junction and the output circuit has a dc voltage VCC (larger than VBB)
to reverse bias the base–collector (BC) junction through a collector resistor RC.
The actual reverse bias voltage across the BC junction is VCE − VBE, where VCE is
VCE = VCC − ICRC

An input signal in the form of a small ac signal vbe is applied in series with the
bias voltage VBB and modulates the voltage VBE across the BE junction about its dc
value VBB. The varying voltage across the BE modulates np(0) up and down about
its dc value, which leads to a varying emitter current and hence to an almost identically varying collector current in the output circuit. The variation in the collector
current is converted to an output voltage signal by the collector resistance RC. Note
that increasing VBE increases IC, which leads to a decrease in VCE. Thus, the output
voltage is 180° out of phase with the input voltage.
Since the BE junction is forward biased, the relationship between IE and VBE is

For small signals, we have vbe = δVBE, ib = δIB, ie = δIE, ic = δIC. Then from Equation 6.70 we see that δIC = β δIB, so ic = βib. Since α ≈ 1, ie ≈ ic.
What is the advantage of the CE circuit over the common base (CB) configuration? First, the input current is the base current, which is about a factor of β smaller
than the emitter current. The ac input resistance of the CE circuit is therefore a
factor of β higher than that of the CB circuit. This means that the amplifier does not
load the ac source; the input resistance of the amplifier is much greater than the
internal (or output) resistance of the ac source at the input. The small-signal input
resistance rbe is

where we differentiated Equation 6.71.
The output ac signal vce develops across the CE and is tapped out through a

which is the same as that in the CB configuration. However, in the CE configuration
the output to input current ratio ic ∕ib = β, whereas this is almost unity in the CB
configuration. Consequently, the CE configuration provides a greater power amplification, which is the second advantage of the CE circuit.
The input signal vbe gives rise to an output current ic. This input voltage to
output current conversion is defined in a parameter called the mutual conductance,

We generally find it convenient to use a small-signal equivalent circuit for the
low-frequency behavior of a BJT in the CE configuration. Between the base and
emitter, the applied ac source voltage vs sees only an input resistance of rbe, as shown
in Figure 6.54. To underline the importance of the transistor input resistance, the
output (or the internal) resistance Rs of the ac source is also shown. In the output
circuit there is a voltage-controlled current source ic which generates a current of
gmvbe. The current ic passes through the load (or collector) resistance RC across which
the voltage signal develops. As we are only interested in ac signals, the batteries
are taken as a short-circuit path for the ac current, which means that the internal

resistances of the batteries are taken as zero. This model, of course, is valid only
under normal and active operating conditions and small signals about dc values, and
at low frequencies.
The bipolar transistor general dc current equation IC = βIB, where β ≈ τh∕τt is
a material-dependent constant, implies that the ac small-signal collector current is
δIC = βδIB

or

ic = βib

Thus the CE dc and ac small-signal current gains are the same. This is a reasonable approximation in the low-frequency range, typically at frequencies below 1∕τh.
It is useful to have a relationship between β, gm, and rbe. Using Equations 6.72 and
6.74, we have

The loading effect makes the output less than 100 mV. To reduce the loading of the ac
source, we need to increase rbe, i.e., reduce the collector current, but that also reduces the
gain. So to keep the gain the same, we need to reduce IC and increase RC. However, RC cannot be increased indefinitely because RC itself is loaded by the input of the next stage and,
in addition, there is an incremental resistance between the collector and emitter terminals
(typically ~100 kΩ) that shunts RC (not shown in Figure 6.54).

JUNCTION FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR (JFET)

6.12.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The basic structure of the junction field effect transistor (JFET) with an n-type channel
(n-channel) is depicted in Figure 6.55a. An n-type semiconductor slab is provided with
contacts at its ends to pass current through it. These terminals are called source (S) and
drain (D). Two of the opposite faces of the n-type semiconductor are heavily p-type
doped to some small depth so that an n-type channel is formed between the source and
drain terminals, as shown in Figure 6.55a. The two p+ regions are normally electrically
connected and are called the gate (G). As the gate is heavily doped, the depletion
layers extend almost entirely into the n-channel, as shown in Figure 6.55a. For simplicity we will assume that the two gate regions are identical (both p+ type) and that the
doping in the n-type semiconductor is uniform. We will define the n-channel to be the
region of conducting n-type material contained between the two depletion layers.
The basic and idealized symmetric structure in Figure 6.55a is useful in explaining the principle of operation as discussed later but does not truly represent the

structure of a typical practical device. A simplified schematic sketch of the cross
section of a more practical device (as, for example, fabricated by the planar technology) is shown in Figure 6.55b where it is apparent that the two gate regions do not
have identical doping and that, except for one of the gates, all contacts are on
one surface.
We first consider the behavior of the JFET with the gate and source shorted
(VGS = 0), as shown in Figure 6.56a. The resistance between S and D is essentially
the resistance of the conducting n-channel between A and B, RAB. When a positive
voltage is applied to D with respect to S (VDS > 0), then a current flows from D to
S, which is called the drain current ID. There is a voltage drop along the channel,
between A and B, as indicated in Figure 6.56a. The voltage in the n-channel is zero
at A and VDS at B. As the voltage along the n-channel is positive, the p+n junctions
between the gates and the n-channel become progressively more reverse-biased from
A to B. Consequently the depletion layers extend more into the channel and thereby
decrease the thickness of the conducting channel from A to B.
Increasing VDS increases the widths of the depletion layers, which penetrate more
into the channel and hence result in more channel narrowing toward the drain. The
resistance of the n-channel RAB therefore increases with VDS. The drain current therefore
does not increase linearly with VDS but falls below it because

and RAB increases with VDS. Thus ID versus VDS exhibits a sublinear behavior, as
shown in the VDS < 5 V region in Figure 6.57.
As VDS increases further, the depletion layers extend more into the channel and
eventually, when VDS = VP (= 5 V), the two depletion layers around B meet at
point P at the drain end of the channel, as depicted in Figure 6.56b. The channel
is then said to be “pinched off” by the two depletion layers. The voltage VP is called
the pinch-off voltage. It is equal to the magnitude of reverse bias needed across
the p+n junctions to make them just touch at the drain end. Since the actual bias

voltage across the p+n junctions at the drain end (B) is VGD, the pinch-off occurs
whenever
VGD = −VP

[6.77]

In the present case, gate to source is shorted, VGS = 0, so VGD = −VDS and pinchoff occurs when VDS = VP (5 V). The drain current from pinch-off onwards, as shown
in Figure 6.57, does not increase significantly with VDS for reasons given below.
Beyond VDS = VP, there is a short pinched-off channel of length ℓpo.
The pinched-off channel is a reverse-biased depletion region that separates the
drain from the n-channel, as depicted in Figure 6.58. There is a very strong electric
field E in this pinched-off region in the D to S direction. This field is the vector sum
of the fields from positive donors to negative acceptors in the depletion regions of
the channel and the gate on the drain side. Electrons in the n-channel drift toward
P, and when they arrive at P, they are swept across the pinched-off channel by E.
This process is similar to minority carriers in the base of a BJT reaching the collector junction depletion region, where the internal field there sweeps them across the
depletion layer into the collector. Consequently the drain current is actually determined by the resistance of the conducting n-channel over Lch from A to P in Figure 6.58
and not by the pinched-off channel.
As VDS increases, most of the additional voltage simply drops across ℓpo as this
region is depleted of carriers and hence highly resistive. Point P, where the depletion
layers first meet, moves slightly toward A, thereby slightly reducing the channel
length Lch. Point P must still be at a potential VP because it is this potential that just
makes the depletion layers touch. Thus the voltage drop across Lch remains as VP.
Beyond pinch-off then
ID =

VP
RAP

(VDS > VP )

Since RAP is determined by Lch, which decreases slightly with VDS, ID increases
slightly with VDS. In many cases, ID is conveniently taken to be saturated at a value
IDSS for VDS > VP. Typical ID versus VDS behavior is shown in Figure 6.57.

We now consider what happens when a negative voltage, say VGS = −2 V, is
applied to the gate with respect to the source, as shown in Figure 6.59a with VDS = 0.
The p+n junctions are now reverse biased from the start, the channel is narrower,
and the channel resistance is now larger than in the VGS = 0 case. The drain current
that flows when a small VDS is applied, as in Figure 6.59b, is now smaller than in
the VGS = 0 case as apparent in Figure 6.57. The p+n junctions are now progressively
more reverse biased from VGS at the source end to VGD = VGS − VDS at the drain end.
We therefore need a smaller VDS (= 3 V) to pinch off the channel, as shown in
Figure 6.59c. When VDS = 3 V, the G to D voltage VGD across the p+n junctions at
the drain end is −5 V, which is −VP, so the channel becomes pinched off. Beyond
pinch-off, ID is nearly saturated just as in the VGS = 0 case, but its magnitude is
obviously smaller as the thickness of the channel at A is smaller; compare Figures 6.56
and 6.59. In the presence of VGS, as apparent from Figure 6.57, the pinch-off occurs
at VDS = VDS(sat), and from Equation 6.77.
Pinch-off
condition

VDS(sat) = VP + VGS

[6.78]

where VGS is a negative voltage (reducing VP). Beyond pinch-off when VDS > VDS(sat),
the point P where the channel is just pinched still remains at potential VDS(sat), given
by Equation 6.78.
For VDS > VDS(sat), ID becomes nearly saturated at a value denoted as IDS, which
is indicated in Figure 6.57. When G and S are shorted (VGS = 0), IDS is called IDSS
(which stands for IDS with shorted gate to source). Beyond pinch-off, with negative

VDS(sat)
RAP (VGS )

VDS > VDS(sat)

[6.79]

where RAP(VGS) is the effective resistance of the conducting n-channel from A to P
(Figure 6.59b), which depends on the channel thickness and hence on VGS. The
resistance increases with more negative gate voltage as this increases the reverse bias
across the p+n junctions, which leads to the narrowing of the channel. For example,
when VGS = −4 V, the channel thickness at A becomes narrower than in the case
with VGS = −2 V, thereby increasing the resistance, RAP, of the conducting channel
and therefore decreasing IDS. Further, there is also a reduction in the drain current
by virtue of VDS(sat) decreasing with negative VGS, as apparent in Equation 6.79.
Figure 6.57 shows the effect of the gate voltage on the ID versus VDS behavior. The
two effects, that from VDS(sat) and that from RAP(VGS) in Equation 6.79, lead to IDS
almost decreasing parabolically with −VGS.
When the gate voltage is such that VGS = −VP (= −5 V) with the source and
drain shorted (VDS = 0), then the two depletion layers touch over the entire channel
length and the whole channel is closed, as illustrated in Figure 6.60. The channel is
said to be off. The only drain current that flows when a VDS is applied is due to the
thermally generated carriers in the depletion layers. This current is very small.
Figure 6.57 summarizes the full ID versus VDS characteristics of the n-channel
JFET at various gate voltages VGS. It is apparent that IDS is relatively independent of
VDS and that it is controlled by the gate voltage VGS, as expected by Equation 6.79.
This is analogous to the BJT in which the collector current IC is controlled by the
base–emitter bias voltage VBE. Figure 6.61a shows the dependence of IDS on the gate
voltage VGS. The transistor action is the control of the drain current IDS, in the drain–
source (output) circuit by the voltage VGS in the gate–source (input circuit), as shown
in Figure 6.61b. This control is only possible if VDS > VDS(sat). When VGS = −Vp, the
drain current is nearly zero because the channel has been totally pinched off. This
gate–source voltage is denoted by VGS(off) as the drain current has been switched off.
Furthermore, we should note that as VGS reverse biases the p+n junction, the current
into the gate IG is the reverse leakage current of these junctions. It is usually very
small. In some JFETs, IG is as low as a fraction of a nanoampere. We should also
note that the circuit symbol for the JFET, as shown in Figure 6.55a, has an arrow
to identify the gate and the pn junction direction.

Is there a convenient relationship between IDS and VGS? If we calculate the effective resistance RAP of the n-channel between A and P, we can obtain its dependence
on the channel thickness, and thus on the widths of the depletion layers and hence
on VGS. We can then find IDS from Equation 6.79. It turns out that a simple parabolic
dependence seems to represent the data reasonably well,
IDS = IDSS[ 1 − (

VGS(off) )]
VGS

2

[6.80]

where IDSS is the drain current when VGS = 0 (Figure 6.61) and VGS(off) is defined as
−VP, that is, that gate–source voltage that just pinches off the channel. The pinch-off
voltage VP here is a positive quantity because it was introduced through VDS(sat).
VGS(off) however is negative, −VP. We should note two important facts about the JFET.
Its name originates from the effect that modulating the electric field in the reversebiased depletion layers (by changing VGS) varies the depletion layer penetration into
the channel and hence the resistance of the channel. The transistor action hence can
be thought of as being based on a field effect. Since there is a p+n junction between
the gate and the channel, the name has become JFET. This junction in reverse bias
provides the isolation between the gate and channel.
Secondly, the region beyond pinch-off, where Equations 6.79 and 6.80 hold, is
commonly called the current saturation region, as well as constant current
region and pentode region. The term saturation should not be confused with
similar terms used for saturation effects in bipolar transistors. A saturated BJT cannot be used as an amplifier, but JFETs are invariably used as amplifiers in the
saturated current region.

6.12.2 JFET AMPLIFIER
The transistor action in the JFET is the control of IDS by VGS, as shown in Figure 6.61.
The input circuit is therefore the gate–source circuit containing VGS and the output
circuit is the drain–source circuit in which the drain current IDS flows. The JFET is
almost never used with the pn junction between the gate and channel forward biased
(VGS > 0) as this would lead to a very large gate current and near shorting of the

gate to source voltage. With VGS limited to negative voltages, the maximum current
in the output circuit can only be IDSS, as shown in Figure 6.61a. The maximum input
voltage VGS should therefore give an IDS less than IDSS.
Figure 6.62a shows a simplified illustration of a typical JFET voltage amplifier.
As the source is common to both the input and output circuits, this is called a
common source (CS) amplifier. The input signal is the ac source vgs connected in
series with a negative dc bias voltage VGG of −1.5 V in the GS circuit. First we will
find out what happens when there is no ac signal in the circuit (vgs = 0). The dc
supply (−1.5 V) in the input provides a negative dc voltage to the gate and therefore
gives a dc current IDS in the output circuit (less than IDSS). Figure 6.62b shows that
when VGS = −1.5 V, point Q on the IDS versus VGS characteristics gives IDS = 4.9 mA.
Point Q, which determines the dc operation, is called the quiescent point.
The ac source vgs is connected in series with the negative dc bias voltage VGS. It
therefore modulates VGS up and down about −1.5 V with time, as shown in Figure 6.62b.
Suppose that vgs varies sinusoidally between −0.5 V and +0.5 V. Then, as shown in
Figure 6.62b when vgs is −0.5 V (point A), VGS = −2.0 V and the drain current is
given by point A on the IDS–VGS curve and is about 3.6 mA. When vgs is +0.5 V
(point B), then VGS = −1.0 V and the drain current is given by point B on the IDS–VGS
curve and is about 6.4 mA. The input variation from −0.5 V to +0.5 V has thus been
converted to a drain current variation from 3.6 mA to 6.4 mA as indicated in Figure 6.62b. We could have just as easily calculated the drain current from Equation 6.80.

NOTE: VDD = 18 V and RD = 2000 Ω.

Table 6.6 summarizes what happens to the drain current as the ac input voltage is
varied about zero.
The change in the drain current with respect to its dc value is the output signal
current denoted as id. Thus at A,
id = 3.6 − 4.9 = −1.3 mA

and at B,
id = 6.4 − 4.9 = 1.5 mA

The variation in the output current is not quite symmetric as that in the input signal
vgs because the IDS–VGS relationship, Equation 6.80, is not linear.
The drain current variations in the DS circuit are converted to voltage variations
by the resistance RD. The voltage across DS is
VDS = VDD − IDS RD

[6.81]

where VDD is the bias battery voltage in the DS circuit. Thus, variations in IDS result
in variations in VDS that are in the opposite direction or 180° out of phase. The ac
output voltage between D and S is tapped out through a capacitor C, as shown in
Figure 6.62a. The capacitor C simply blocks the dc. Suppose that RD = 2000 Ω and
VDD = 18 V, then using Equation 6.81 we can calculate the dc value of VDS and also
the minimum and maximum values of VDS, as shown in Table 6.6.
It is apparent that as vgs varies from −0.5 V, at A, to +0.5 V, at B, VDS varies
from 10.8 V to 5.2 V, respectively. The change in VDS with respect to dc is what
constitutes the output signal vds, as only the ac is tapped out. From Equation 6.81,
the change in VDS is related to the change in IDS by
vds = −RDid

[6.82]

Thus, the output, vds, changes from −3.0 V to 2.6 V. The peak-to-peak voltage amplification is

The negative sign represents the fact that the output and input voltages are out
of phase by 180°. This can also be seen from Table 6.6 where a negative vgs results
in a positive vds. Even though the ac input signal vgs is symmetric about zero, ±0.5 V,

the ac output signal vds is not symmetric, which is due to the IDS versus VGS curve
being nonlinear, and thus varies between −3.0 V and 2.6 V. If we were to calculate
the voltage amplification for the most negative input signal, we would find −5.2,
whereas for the most positive input signal, it would be −6. The peak-to-peak voltage
amplification, which was −5.6, represents a mean gain taking both negative and
positive input signals into account.
The amplification can of course be increased by increasing RD, but we must
maintain VDS at all times above VDS(sat) (beyond pinch-off) to ensure that the drain
current IDS in the output circuit is only controlled by VGS in the input circuit.
When the signals are small about dc values, we can use differentials to represent
small signals. For example, vgs = δVGS, id = δIDS, vds = δVDS, and so on. The variation δIDS due to δVGS about the dc value may be used to define a mutual transconductance gm (sometimes denoted as gfs) for the JFET,

Figure 6.62b. Suppose that the gate dc bias voltage supply VGG = −1.5 V, the drain circuit
supply VDD = 18 V, and RD = 2000 Ω. What is the voltage amplification for small signals?
How does this compare with the peak-to-peak amplification of −5.6 found for an input signal

We first calculate the operating conditions at the bias point with no ac signals. This corresponds to point Q in Figure 6.62b. The dc bias voltage VGS across the gate to source is
−1.5 V. The resulting dc drain current IDS can be calculated from Equation 6.80 with

This turns out to be the same as the peak-to-peak voltage amplification we calculated in
Table 6.6. When the input ac signal vgs varies between −0.5 and +0.5 V, as in Table 6.6, the
output signal is not symmetric. It varies between −3 V and 2.8 V, so the voltage gain depends
on the input signal. The amplifier is then said to exhibit nonlinearity.

METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD EFFECT
TRANSISTOR (MOSFET)

6.13.1 FIELD EFFECT AND INVERSION
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor is based on the effect of a field
penetrating into a semiconductor. Its operation can be understood by first considering
a parallel plate capacitor with metal electrodes and a vacuum as insulation in between,
as shown in Figure 6.63a. When a voltage V is applied between the plates, charges
+Q and −Q (where Q = CV) appear on the plates and there is an electric field given
by E = V∕L. The origins of these charges are the conduction electrons for −Q and
exposed positively charged metal ions for +Q. Metallic bonding is based on all the
valence electrons forming a sea of conduction electrons and permeating the space between
metal ions that are fixed at crystal lattice sites. Since the electrons are mobile, they are
readily displaced by the field. Thus, in the lower plate E displaces some of the conduction electrons to the surface to form −Q. In the top plate E displaces some of the electrons
from the surface into the bulk to expose positively charged metal ions to form +Q.
Suppose that the plate area is 1 cm2 and spacing is 0.1 μm and that we apply 2 V
across it. The capacitance C is 8.85 nF and the magnitude of charge Q on each plate
is 1.77 × 10−8 C, which corresponds to 1.1 × 1011 electrons. A typical metal such
as copper has something like 2 × 1015 atoms per cm2 on the surface. Thus, there
will be that number of positive metal ions and electrons on the surface (assuming
one conduction electron per atom). The charges +Q and −Q can therefore be generated by the electrons and metal ions at the surface alone. For example, if one in
every 1.7 × 104 electrons on the surface moves one atomic spacing (∼0.3 nm) into
the bulk, then the surface will have a charge of +Q due to exposed positive metal
ions. It is clear that, for all practical purposes, the electric field does not penetrate
into the metal and terminates at the metal surface.
The same is not true when one of the electrodes is a semiconductor, as shown
in Figure 6.63b where the “capacitor” now is of a metal-insulator-semiconductor
(MOS) device. Suppose that we replace the lower metal in Figure 6.63a with a p-type
semiconductor with an acceptor concentration of 1015 cm−3. The number of acceptor
atoms on the surface19 is 1 × 1010 cm−2. We may assume that at room temperature

Surface concentration of atoms (atoms per unit area) can be found from nsurf ≈ (nbulk)2∕3.

all the acceptors are ionized and thus negatively charged. It is immediately apparent
that we do not have a sufficient number of negative acceptors at the surface to generate the charge −Q. We must therefore also expose negative acceptors in the bulk,
which means that the field must penetrate into the semiconductor. Holes in the
surface region of the semiconductor become repelled toward the bulk and thereby

625

626

CHAPTER 6

∙

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

expose more negative acceptors. We can estimate the width W into which the field
penetrates since the total negative charge exposed eAWNa must be Q. We find that
W is of the order of 1 μm, which is something like 4000 atomic layers. Our conclusion is that the field penetrates into a semiconductor by an amount that depends on
the doping concentration.
The penetrating field into the semiconductor drifts away most of the holes in
this region and thereby exposes negatively charged acceptors to make up the charge
−Q. The region into which the field penetrates has lost holes and is therefore depleted
of its equilibrium concentration of holes. We refer to this region as a depletion layer.
As long as p > n even though p ≪ Na, this region still has p-type characteristics as
holes are in the majority.
If the voltage increases further, −Q also increases in magnitude, as the field
becomes stronger and penetrates more into the semiconductor but eventually it
becomes more difficult to make up the charge −Q by simply extending the depletion layer width W into the bulk. It becomes possible (and more favorable) to attract
conduction electrons into the depletion layer and form a thin electron layer of width
Wn near the surface. The charge −Q is now made up of the fixed negative charge
of acceptors in Wa and of conduction electrons in Wn, as shown in Figure 6.63c.
Further increases in the voltage do not change the width Wa of the depletion layer
but simply increase the electron concentration in Wn. Where do these electrons come
from as the semiconductor is doped p-type? Some are attracted into the depletion
layer from the bulk, where they were minority carriers. But most are thermally
generated by the breaking of Si–Si bonds (i.e., across the bandgap) in the depleted
layer. Thermal generation in the depletion layer generates EHPs that become separated by the field. The holes are then drifted by the field into the bulk and the
electrons toward the surface. Recombination of the thermally generated electrons
and holes with other carriers is greatly reduced because the depletion layer has so
few carriers. Since the electron concentration in the electron layer exceeds the hole
concentration and this layer is within a normally p-type semiconductor, we call this
an inversion layer.
It is now apparent that increasing the field in the metal-insulator-semiconductor
device first creates a depletion layer and then an inversion layer at the surface when
the voltage exceeds some threshold value Vth. This is the basic principle of the field
effect device. As long as V > Vth, any increase in the field and hence ∣−Q∣ leads to
more electrons in the inversion layer, whereas the width of the depletion layer Wa
and hence the quantity of fixed negative charge remain constant. The insulator
between the metal and the semiconductor, that is, a vacuum in Figure 6.63, is typically SiO2 in many devices.

6.13.2 ENHANCEMENT MOSFET
Figure 6.64 shows the basic structure of an enhancement n-channel MOSFET device
(NMOSFET). A metal-insulator-semiconductor structure is formed between a p-type
Si substrate and a metal electrode, which is called the gate (G). The insulator is the
SiO2 oxide grown during fabrication. There are two n+ doped regions at the ends of
the MOS device that form the source (S) and drain (D). A metal contact is also made

to the p-type Si substrate (or the bulk), which in many devices is connected to the
source terminal as shown in Figure 6.64. Further, many MOSFETs have a degenerately doped polycrystalline Si material as the gate that serves the same function as
the metal electrode.
With no voltage applied to the gate, S to D is an n+pn+ structure that is always
reverse biased whatever the polarity of the source to drain voltage. However, if
the substrate (bulk) is connected to the source, a negative VDS will forward
bias the n+p junction between the drain and the substrate. As the n-channel
MOSFET device is not normally used with a negative VDS, we will not consider
this polarity.
When a positive voltage less than Vth is applied to the gate, VGS < Vth, as shown
in Figure 6.65a, the p-type semiconductor under the gate develops a depletion layer
as a result of the expulsion of holes into the bulk, just as in Figure 6.63b. Since S
and D are isolated by a low-conductivity p-doped region that has a depletion layer
from S to D, no current can flow for any positive VDS.
With VDS = 0, as soon as VGS is increased beyond the threshold voltage Vth,
an n-channel inversion layer is formed within the depletion layer under the gate
and immediately below the surface, as shown in Figure 6.65b. This n-channel
links the two n+ regions of source and drain. We then have a continuous n-type
material with electrons as mobile carriers between the source and drain. When a
small VDS is applied, a drain current ID flows that is limited by the resistance of
the n-channel Rn-ch:
ID =

VDS
Rn-ch

[6.85]

Thus, ID initially increases with VDS almost linearly, as shown in Figure 6.65b.
The voltage variation along the channel is from zero at A (source end) to VDS at
B (drain end). The gate to the n-channel voltage is then VGS at A and VGD = VGS −
VDS at B. Thus point A depends only on VGS and remains undisturbed by VDS. As
VDS increases, the voltage at B (VGD) decreases and thereby causes less inversion.
This means that the channel gets narrower from A to B and its resistance Rn-ch,
increases with VDS. ID versus VDS then falls increasingly below the ID ∝ VDS line.
Eventually when the gate to n-channel voltage at B decreases to just below Vth, the
inversion layer at B disappears and a depletion layer is exposed, as illustrated in

Figure 6.65c. The n-channel becomes pinched off at this point P. This occurs when
VDS = VDS(sat), satisfying
VGD = VGS − VDS(sat) = Vth

[6.86]

It is apparent that the whole process of the narrowing of the n-channel and its
eventual pinch-off is similar to the operation of the n-channel JFET. When the drifting electrons in the n-channel reach P, the large electric field within the very narrow
depletion layer at P sweeps the electrons across into the n+ drain. The current is
limited by the supply of electrons from the n-channel to the depletion layer at P,
which means that it is limited by the effective resistance of the n-channel between
A and P.
When VDS exceeds VDS(sat), the additional VDS drops mainly across the highly
resistive depletion layer at P, which extends slightly to P′ toward A, as shown in
Figure 6.65d. At P′, the gate to channel voltage must still be just Vth as this is the
voltage required to just pinch off the channel and just eliminate inversion. The widening of the depletion layer (from B to P′) at the drain end with VDS, however, is
small compared with the channel length AB. The resistance of the channel from A
to P′ does not change significantly with increasing VDS, which means that the drain
current ID is then nearly saturated at IDS,
ID ≈ IDS ≈

[6.87]

As VDS(sat) depends on VGS, so does IDS. The overall IDS versus VDS characteristics
for various fixed gate voltages VGS of a typical enhancement MOSFET is shown in
Figure 6.66a. It can be seen that there is only a slight increase in IDS with VDS
beyond VDS(sat). The IDS versus VGS when VDS > VDS(sat) characteristics are shown in
Figure 6.66b. It is apparent that as long as VDS > VDS(sat), the saturated drain current
IDS in the source–drain (or output) circuit is almost totally controlled by the gate
voltage VGS in the source–gate (or input) circuit. This is what constitutes the MOSFET

action. Variations in VGS then lead to variations in the drain current IDS ( just as in
the JFET), which forms the basis of the MOSFET amplifier. The term enhancement
refers to the fact that a gate voltage exceeding Vth is required to enhance a conducting channel between the source and drain. This contrasts with the JFET where the
gate voltage depletes the channel and decreases the drain current.
The experimental relationship between IDS and VGS (when VDS > VDS(sat)) has
been found to be best described by a parabolic equation similar to that for the JFET,
except that now VGS enhances the channel when VGS > Vth so IDS exists only when
VGS > Vth,

IDS is independent of VDS. The shallow slopes of the ID versus VDS lines beyond
VDS(sat) in Figure 6.66a can be accounted for by writing Equation 6.88 as

where λ is a constant that is typically 0.01 V−1. If we extend the IDS versus VDS lines,
they intersect the −VDS axis at 1∕λ, which is called the Early voltage. It should be
apparent that IDSS, which is IDS with the gate and source shorted (VGS = 0), is zero
and is not a useful quantity in describing the behavior of the enhancement MOSFET.
The drift mobility μe in Equation 6.89 represents the drift of electrons in the
channel near the surface of the semiconductor. This region also has the field from
the gate penetrating into it as well as a longitudinal field along the channel. μe is
not the same as the drift mobility in the bulk of p-Si but depends on the field
penetrating into the channel, and defects and dopants in this region, especially near
the semiconductor–oxide interface. μe is therefore a field effect mobility and should
be viewed as an effective mobility in the channel.

a gate with a width (Z) of 50 μm, length (L) of 10 μm, and SiO2 thickness of 450 Å. The
relative permittivity of SiO2 is 3.9. Its threshold voltage is 4 V. Estimate the drain current
when VGS = 8 V and VDS = 20 V, given λ = 0.01. The effective electron drift mobility μe is
roughly 700 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Since VDS > Vth, we can assume that the drain current is saturated and we can use the IDS

6.13.3 THRESHOLD VOLTAGE
The threshold voltage is an important parameter in MOSFET devices. Its control in
device fabrication is therefore essential. Figure 6.67a shows an idealized MOS structure where all the electric field lines from the metal pass through the oxide and
penetrate the p-type semiconductor. The charge −Q is made up of fixed negative
acceptors in a surface region of Wa and of conduction electrons in the inversion layer
at the surface, as shown in Figure 6.67a. The voltage drop across the MOS structure,
however, is not uniform. As the field penetrates the semiconductor, there is a voltage
drop Vsc across the field penetration region of the semiconductor by virtue of
E = −dV∕dx, as shown in Figure 6.67a. The field terminates on both electrons in the

inversion layer and acceptors in Wa, so within the semiconductor E is not uniform
and therefore the voltage drop is not constant. But the field in the oxide is uniform,
as we assumed there were no charges inside the oxide. The voltage drop across the
oxide is constant and is Vox, as shown in Figure 6.67a. If the applied voltage is V1,
we must have Vsc + Vox = V1. The actual voltage drop Vsc across the semiconductor
determines the condition for inversion. We can show this as follows. If the acceptor
doping concentration is 1016 cm−3, then the Fermi level EF in the bulk of the p-type
semiconductor must be 0.347 eV below EFi in intrinsic Si. To make the surface
n-type we need to shift EF at the surface to go just above EFi. Thus we need to shift
EF from bulk to surface by at least 0.347 eV. We have to bend the energy band by
0.347 eV at the surface. Since the voltage drop across the semiconductor is Vsc and
the corresponding electrostatic PE change is eVsc, this must be 0.347 eV or Vsc =
0.347 V. The gate voltage for the start of inversion will then be Vox + 0.347 V. By
inversion, however, we generally infer that the electron concentration at the surface
is comparable to the hole concentration in the bulk. This means that we actually
have to shift EF above EFi by another 0.347 eV, so the gate threshold voltage Vth
must be Vox + 0.694 V.
In practice there are a number of other important effects that must be considered
in evaluating the threshold voltage. Invariably there are charges both within the oxide
and at the oxide–semiconductor interface that alter the field penetration into the
semiconductor and hence the threshold voltage needed at the gate to cause inversion.
Some of these are depicted in Figure 6.67b and can be qualitatively summarized as
follows.
There may be some mobile ions within the SiO2, such as alkaline ions (Na+,
+
K ), which are denoted as Qmi in Figure 6.67b. These may be introduced unintentionally, for example, during cleaning and etching processes in the fabrication. In addition there may be various trapped (immobile) charges within the oxide Qot due to
structural defects, for example, an interstitial Si+. Frequently these oxide trapped
charges are created as a result of radiation damage (irradiation by X-rays or other
high-energy beams). They can be reduced by annealing the device.
A significant number of fixed positive charges (Qf) exist in the oxide region
close to the interface. They are believed to originate from the nonstoichiometry of
the oxide near the oxide–semiconductor interface. They are generally attributed to
positively charged Si+ ions. During the oxidation process, a Si atom is removed from
the Si surface to react with the oxygen diffusing in through the oxide. When the
oxidation process is stopped suddenly, there are unfulfilled Si ions in this region. Qf
depends on the crystal orientation and on the oxidation and annealing processes. The
semiconductor to oxide interface itself is a sudden change in the structure from
crystalline Si to amorphous oxide. The semiconductor surface itself will have various
defects, as discussed in Chapter 1. There is some inevitable mismatch between the
two structures at the interface, and consequently there are broken bonds, dangling
bonds, point defects such as vacancies and Si+, and other defects at this interface
that trap charges (e.g., holes). All these interface-trapped charges are represented as
Qit in Figure 6.67b. Qit depends not only on the crystal orientation but also on the
chemical composition of the interface. Both Qf and Qit overall represent a positive
charge that effectively reduces the gate voltage needed for inversion. They are smaller

6 .1 3

METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR (MOSFET)

for the (100) surface than the (111) surface, so (100) is the preferred surface for the
Si MOS device.
In addition to various charges in the oxide and at the interface shown in Figure 6.67b, there will also be a voltage difference, denoted as VFB, between the semiconductor surface and the metal surface, even in the absence of an applied voltage.
VFB arises from the work function difference between the metal and the p-type semiconductor, as discussed in Chapter 4. The metal work function is generally smaller
than the semiconductor work function, which means that the semiconductor surface
will have an accumulation of electrons and the metal surface will have positive
charges (exposed metal ions). The gate voltage needed for inversion will therefore
also depend on VFB. Since VFB is normally positive and Qf and Qit are also positive,
there may already be an inversion layer formed at the semiconductor surface even
without a positive gate voltage. The fabrication of an enhancement MOSFET then
requires special fabrication procedures, such as ion implantation, to obtain a positive
and predictable Vth.
The simplest way to control the threshold gate voltage is to provide a separate
electrode to the bulk of an enhancement MOSFET, as shown in Figure 6.64, and to
apply a bias voltage to the bulk with respect to the source to obtain the desired Vth
between the gate and source. This technique has the disadvantage of requiring an
additional bias supply for the bulk and also adjusting the bulk to source voltage
almost individually for each MOSFET.

6.13.4 ION IMPLANTED MOS TRANSISTORS AND POLY-SI GATES
The most accurate method of controlling the threshold voltage is by ion implantation,
as the number of ions that are implanted into a device and their location can be
closely controlled. Furthermore, ion implantation can also provide a self-alignment
of the edges of the gate electrode with the source and drain regions. In the case of
an n-channel enhancement MOSFET, it is generally desirable to keep the p-type
doping in the bulk low to avoid small VDS for reverse breakdown between the drain
and the bulk (see Figure 6.64). Consequently, the surface, in practice, already has
an inversion layer (without any gate voltage) due to various fixed positive charges
residing in the oxide and at the interface, as shown in Figure 6.67b (positive Qf and
Qit and VFB). It then becomes necessary to implant the surface region under the gate
with boron acceptors to remove the electrons and restore this region to a p-type
behavior.
The ion implantation process is carried out in a vacuum chamber where the required
impurity ions are generated and then accelerated toward the device. The energy of
the arriving ions and hence their penetration into the device can be readily controlled.
Typically, the device is implanted with B acceptors under the gate oxide, as shown
in Figure 6.68. The distribution of implanted acceptors as a function of distance into
the device from the surface of the oxide is also shown in the figure. The position of
the peak depends on the energy of the ions and hence on the accelerating voltage. The
peak of the concentration of implanted acceptors is made to occur just below the
surface of the semiconductor. Since ion implantation involves the impact of energetic
ions with the crystal structure, it results in the inevitable generation of various defects

within the implanted region. The defects are almost totally eliminated by annealing
the device at an elevated temperature. Annealing also broadens the acceptor implanted
region as a result of increased diffusion of implanted acceptors.
Ion implantation also has the advantage of providing self-alignment of the drain
and source with the edges of the gate electrode. In a MOS transistor, it is important
that the gate electrode extends all the way from the source to the drain regions so
that the channel formed under the gate can link the two regions; otherwise, an
incomplete channel will be formed. To avoid the possibility of forming an incomplete
channel, it is necessary to allow for some overlap, as shown in Figure 6.69a, between
the gate and source and drain regions because of various tolerances and variations
involved in the fabrication of a MOSFET by conventional masking and diffusional
techniques. The overlap, however, results in additional capacitances between the gate
and source and the gate and drain and adversely affects the high-frequency (or transient) response of the device. It is therefore desirable to align the edges of the gate
electrode with the source and drain regions. Suppose that the gate electrode is made
narrower so that it does not extend all the way between the source and drain regions,
as shown in Figure 6.69b. If the device is now ion implanted with donors, then donor
ions passing through the thin oxide will extend the n+ regions up to the edges of the
gate and thereby align the drain and source with the edges of the gate. The thick
metal gate is practically impervious to the arriving donor ions.
Another method of controlling Vth is to use silicon instead of a metal for the
gate electrode. This technique is called silicon gate technology. Typically, the silicon
for the gate is vacuum deposited (e.g., by chemical vapor deposition using silane

gas) onto the oxide, as shown in Figure 6.70. As the oxide is noncrystalline, the
Si gate is polycrystalline (rather than a single crystal) and is therefore called a poly-Si
gate. Normally it is heavily doped to ensure that it has sufficiently low resistivity to
avoid RC time constant limitations in charging and discharging the gate capacitance
during transient or ac operations. The advantage of the poly-Si gate is that its work
function depends on the doping (type and concentration) and can be controlled so
that VFB and hence Vth can also be controlled. There are also additional advantages
in using the poly-Si gate. For example, it can be raised to high temperatures during
fabrication whereas a metal such as Al would melt at 660 °C. It can be used as a
mask over the gate region of the semiconductor during the formation of the source
and drain regions. If ion implantation is used to deposit donors into the semiconductor, then the n+ source and drain regions are self-aligned with the poly-Si gate, as
shown in Figure 6.70.

The pin Si diode is a device that has a structure with three distinct layers: a heavily
doped thin p+-type layer, a relatively thick intrinsic (i-Si) layer, and a heavily doped
thin n+-type layer, as shown in Figure 6.71a. For simplicity we will assume that the
i-layer is truly intrinsic, or at least doped so lightly compared with p+ and n+ layers
that it behaves almost as if intrinsic. The intrinsic layer is much wider than the p+
and n+ regions, typically 5–50 μm depending on the particular application. When
the structure is first formed, holes diffuse from the p+-side and electrons from the
n+-side into the i-Si layer where they recombine and disappear. This leaves behind
a thin layer of exposed negatively charged acceptor ions in the p+-side and a thin

layer of exposed positively charged donor ions in the n+-side as shown in Figure 6.71b.
The two charges are separated by the i-Si layer of thickness W. There is a uniform
built-in field Eo in the i-Si layer from the exposed positive ions to the exposed
negative ions as illustrated in Figure 6.71c. (Since there is no net space charge in
the i-layer, from dE∕dx = ρ∕εoεr = 0, the field must be uniform.) In contrast, the
built-in field in the depletion layer of a pn junction is not uniform. With no applied

6 .1 4

bias, the equilibrium is maintained by the built-in field Eo which prevents further
diffusion of majority carriers from the p+ and n+ layers into the i-Si layer. A hole
that manages to diffuse from the p+-side into the i-layer is drifted back by Eo, so the
net current is zero. As in the pn junction, there is also a built-in potential Vo from
the edge of the p+-side depletion region to the edge of the n+-side depletion region.
Vo (like Eo) provides a potential barrier against further net diffusion of holes from
the p+-side and electrons from the n+-side into the i-layer and maintains the equilibrium in the open circuit (net current being zero) as in the pn junction. It is apparent
from Figure 6.71c that, in the absence of an applied voltage, Eo ≈ Vo∕W.
One of the distinct advantages of pin diodes is that the depletion layer capacitance is very small and independent of the voltage. The separation of two very thin
layers of negative and positive charges by a fixed distance, width W of the i-Si layer,
is the same as that in a parallel plate capacitor. The junction or depletion layer
capacitance of the pin diode is simply given by
Cdep =

εoεr A
W

[6.91]

Junction
capacitance
of pin

where A is the cross-sectional area and εoεr is the permittivity of the semiconductor
(Si), respectively. Further, since the width W of the i-Si layer is fixed by the structure,
the junction capacitance does not depend on the applied voltage in contrast to that
of the pn junction. Cdep is typically of the order of a picofarad in fast pin photodiodes,
so with a 50 Ω resistor, the RCdep time constant is about 50 ps.
When a reverse bias voltage Vr is applied across the pin device, it drops almost
entirely across the width of the i-Si layer. The depletion layer widths of the thin
sheets of acceptor and donor charges in the p+ and n+ sides are negligible compared
with W. The reverse bias Vr increases the built-in voltage to Vo + Vr as shown in
Figure 6.71d. The field E in the i-Si layer is still uniform and increases to
E≈

Vr
W

(Vr ≫ Vo )

[6.92]

Since the width of the i-layer in a pin device is typically much larger than the depletion layer width in an ordinary pn junction, the pin devices usually have higher
breakdown voltages, which makes them useful where high breakdown voltages are
required.
In pin photodetectors, the pin structure is designed so that photon absorption
occurs primarily over the i-Si layer. The photogenerated EHPs in the i-Si layer are
then separated by the field E and drifted toward the n+ and p+ sides, respectively,
as illustrated in Figure 6.71d. While the photogenerated carriers are drifting through
the i-Si layer, they give rise to an external photocurrent which is easily detected as
a voltage across a small sampling resistor R in Figure 6.71d (or detected by a currentto-voltage converter). The response time of the pin photodiode is determined by the
transit times of the photogenerated carriers across the width W of the i-Si layer.
Increasing W allows more photons to be absorbed, which increases the output signal
per input light intensity, but it slows down the speed of response because carrier
transit times become longer.

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

The simple pn junction photodiode has two major drawbacks. Its junction or
depletion layer capacitance is not sufficiently small to allow photodetection at high
modulation frequencies. This is an RC time constant limitation. Secondly, its depletion layer is at most a few microns. This means that at long wavelengths where the
penetration depth of light is greater than the depletion layer width, the majority of
photons are absorbed outside the depletion layer where there is no field to separate
the EHPs and drift them. The photodetector efficiency is correspondingly low at
these long wavelengths. These problems are substantially reduced in the pin photodiode.20 The pin photovoltaic devices, such as a-Si:H solar cells, are designed to have
the photogeneration occur in the i-layer as in the case of photodetectors. Obviously,
there is no external applied bias, and the built-in field Eo separates the EHPs and
drives the photocurrent.

SEMICONDUCTOR OPTICAL AMPLIFIERS
AND LASERS

All practical semiconductor laser diodes are double heterostructures (DH) whose
energy band diagrams are similar to the LED diagram in Figure 6.25. The energy
band diagram of a forward biased DH laser diode is shown in Figure 6.72a and b.
In this case the semiconductors are AlGaAs with Eg ≈ 2.0 eV and GaAs with Eg ≈
1.4 eV. The p-GaAs region is a thin layer, typically 0.1–0.2 μm, and constitutes the
active layer in which stimulated emissions take place. Both p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs
are heavily p-type doped and are degenerate with the Fermi level EFp in the valence
band. When a sufficiently large forward bias is applied, Ec of n-AlGaAs moves very
close to the Ec of p-GaAs which leads to a large injection of electrons from the CB
Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish at Bell
Labs (1971) were able to design the first
semiconductor laser that operated continuously
at room temperature. (Notice the similarity of
the energy band diagram on the chalkboard

of n-AlGaAs into p-GaAs as shown in Figure 6.72b. In fact, with a sufficient large
forward bias, Ec of AlGaAs can be moved above the Ec of GaAs, which causes an
enormous electron injection from n-AlGaAs into the CB of p-GaAs. These injected
electrons, however, are confined to the CB of p-GaAs since there is a barrier ΔEc
between p-GaAs and p-AlGaAs due to the change in the bandgap.
The p-GaAs layer is degenerately doped. Thus, the top of its valence band (VB)
is full of holes, or it has all the electronic states empty above the Fermi level EFp in
this layer. The large forward bias injects a very large concentration of electrons from
n-AlGaAs into the conduction band of p-GaAs. Consequently, as shown in Figure 6.72c,
there is a large concentration of electrons in the CB and totally empty states at the top
of the VB, which means that there is a population inversion. An incoming photon with
an energy hfo just above Eg can stimulate a conduction electron in the p-GaAs layer
to fall down from the CB to the VB and emit a photon by stimulated emission as
depicted in Figure 6.72c. Such a transition is a photon-stimulated electron–hole recombination, or a lasing recombination. Thus, an avalanche of stimulated emissions in the

active layer provides an optical amplification of photons with hfo in this layer. The
amplification depends on the extent of population inversion and hence on the diode
forward current. The device operates as a semiconductor optical amplifier which
amplifies an optical signal that is passed through the active layer. There is a threshold
current below which there is no stimulated emission and no optical amplification.
To construct a semiconductor laser with a self-sustained lasing emission we
have to incorporate the active layer into an optical cavity just as in the case of the
HeNe laser in Chapter 3. The optical cavity with reflecting ends, reflects the coherent photons back and forward and encourages their constructive interference within
the cavity as depicted in Figure 6.73. This leads to a buildup of high-energy electromagnetic oscillations in the cavity. Some of this electromagnetic energy in the
cavity is tapped out as output radiation by having one end of the cavity as partially
reflecting. For example, one type of optical cavity, as shown in Figure 6.73, has a
special reflector, called a Bragg distributed reflector (BDR), at one end to reflect
only certain wavelengths back into the cavity.21 A BDR is a periodic corrugated
structure, like a reflection grating, etched in a semiconductor that reflects only certain wavelengths that are related to the corrugation periodicity. This Bragg reflector
has a corrugation periodicity such that it reflects only one desirable wavelength that
falls within the optical gain of the active region. This wavelength selective reflection
leads to only one possible electromagnetic radiation mode existing in the cavity,
which leads to a very narrow output spectrum: a single-mode output, that is, only
one peak in the output spectrum shown in Figure 3.47. Semiconductor lasers that
operate with only one mode in the radiation output are called single-mode or singlefrequency lasers; the spectral linewidth of a single-mode laser output is typically
∼0.1 nm, which should be compared with an LED spectral width of 120 nm operating at a 1550 nm emission.
21
Partial reflections of waves from the corrugations in the DBR can interfere constructively and constitute a
reflected wave only for certain wavelengths, called Bragg wavelengths, that are related to the periodicity of the
corrugations. A DBR acts like a reflection grating in optics.

The double heterostructure has further advantages. Wider bandgap semiconductors generally have lower refractive indices, which means AlGaAs has a lower refractive index than that of GaAs. The change in the refractive index defines an optical
dielectric waveguide that confines the photons to the active region of the optical
cavity and thereby reduces photon losses and increases the photon concentration.
This increase in the photon concentration increases the rate of stimulated emissions
and the efficiency of the laser.
To achieve the necessary stimulated emissions from a laser diode and build up
the necessary optical oscillations in the cavity (to overcome all the optical losses) the
current must exceed a certain threshold current Ith as shown in Figure 6.74a. The
optical power output at a current I is then very roughly proportional to I − Ith. There
is still some weak optical power output below Ith, but this is simply due to spontaneous recombinations of injected electrons and holes in the active layer; the laser diode
behaves like a “poor” LED below Ith. The output light from an LED however increases
almost in proportion to the diode current. Figure 6.74b compares the output spectrum
from the two devices. Remember that the output light from the laser diode is coherent
radiation, whereas that from an LED is a stream of incoherent photons.

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

Base width modulation (the Early effect) is the
modulation of the base width by the voltage appearing
across the base–collector junction. An increase in the
base to collector voltage increases the collector junction depletion layer width, which results in the narrowing of the base width.
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a transistor
whose normal operation is based on the injection of
carriers from the emitter into the base region, where
they become minority carriers, and their subsequent
diffusion to the collector, where they give rise to a collector current. The voltage between the base and the
emitter controls the collector current.
Built-in field is the internal electric field in the depletion region of a pn junction that is maximum at the
metallurgical junction. It is due to exposed negative
acceptors on the p-side and positive donors on the
n-side of the junction.
Built-in voltage (Vo) is the voltage across a pn junction, going from a p- to n-type semiconductor, in an
open circuit.

components to implement a circuit.
Collector junction is the metallurgical junction between the base and the collector of a bipolar transistor.
Confining (or confinement) layer in a heterostructure is next to the active layer in which electrons are to
be confined; the confining layer introduces a step
increase in Ec to prevent the electrons passing from the
active layer into the confining layer.
Critical electric field is the field in the space charge
(or depletion) region at reverse breakdown (avalanche
or Zener).
Depletion layer (or space charge layer, SCL) is a

of its large number of equilibrium majority carriers.
Depletion (space charge) layer capacitance is the

resistance: gd = 1∕rd.
Emitter junction is the metallurgical junction between
the emitter and the base.
Enhancement MOSFET is a MOSFET device that
needs a gate to source voltage above the threshold voltage to form a conducting channel between the source
and the drain. In the absence of a gate voltage, there is
no conduction between the source and drain. In its
usual mode of operation, the gate voltage enhances the
conductance of the source to drain inversion layer and
increases the drain current.
Epitaxial layer is a thin layer of crystal that has been
grown on the surface of another crystal which is usually a substrate, a mechanical support for the new crystal layer. The atoms of the new layer bond to follow the
crystal pattern of the substrate, so the crystal structure
of the epitaxial layer is matched with the crystal structure of the substrate.
Epitaxy is the growth of a layer of single crystal material on top of a single crystal substrate in such a way
that the new layer has the same structure as the substrate crystal.

outside.

Field effect transistor (FET) is a transistor whose
normal operation is based on controlling the conductance of a channel between two electrodes by the application of an external field. The effect of the applied
field is to control the current flow. The current is due to
majority carrier drift from the source to the drain and
is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate.

Inversion occurs when an applied voltage to the gate
(or metal electrode) of a MOS device causes the semiconductor under the oxide to develop a conducting
layer (or a channel) at the surface of the semiconductor.
The conducting layer has opposite polarity carriers to
the bulk semiconductor and hence is termed an inversion layer.

impinge on a sample to be doped. The sample is
grounded to neutralize the implanted ions.

Forward bias is the application of an external voltage

AlGaAs ternary alloy. There may or may not be a
change in the doping.
Homojunction is a junction between differently
doped regions of the same semiconducting material,
for example, a pn junction in the same silicon crystal;
there is no change in the bandgap energy Eg.
Hyperabrupt pn junction typically has one side
heavily doped and the dopant concentration Nd on the
other side is large near the metallurgical junction
M and decays as Nd ∝ xm where x is the distance from
M and m is between −1 and −3∕2.
Impact ionization is the process by which a high
electric field accelerates a free charge carrier (electron
in the CB), which then impacts with a Si–Si bond to
generate a free EHP. The impact excites an electron
from Ev to Ec.

SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

Metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor (MOST) is a
field effect transistor in which the conductance between the source and drain is controlled by the voltage
supplied to the gate electrode, which is insulated from
the channel by an oxide layer.
Minority carrier injection is the flow of electrons
into the p-side and holes into the n-side of a pn junction
when a voltage is applied to reduce the built-in voltage
across the junction.
MOS is short for a metal-insulator-semiconductor
structure in which the insulator is typically silicon oxide. It can also be a different type of dielectric; for example, it can be the nitride Si3N4.
NMOS is an enhancement type n-channel MOSFET.
Nonradiative lifetime (τnr) is the recombination time
of a minority carrier with a majority carrier in which
there is no emission of a photon; 1∕τr is the probability
of indirect recombination per unit time.
One-sided pn junction has one side heavily doped
and the other side lightly doped as in the p+n junction
where the p-side is much more heavily doped than the
n-side; the depletion region is nearly all in the n-side.
Passive device or component is a device that exhibits
no gain and no directional function. Resistors, capacitors, and inductors are passive components.
Photocurrent is the current generated by a lightreceiving device when it is illuminated.
Pinch-off voltage is the gate to source voltage needed
to just pinch off the conducting channel between the
source and drain with no source to drain voltage applied. It is also the source to drain voltage that just
pinches off the channel when the gate and source are
shorted. Beyond pinch-off, the drain current is almost
constant and controlled by VGS.
PMOS is an enhancement type p-channel MOSFET.
Poly-Si gate is short for a polycrystalline and highly
doped Si gate.
Quantum well is a very thin layer of lower bandgap
semiconductor that is sandwiched by two wider bandgap semiconductors.
Radiant flux is the optical power (W), that is, the
flow of electromagnetic (radiation) energy per unit

Radiative lifetime (τr) is the recombination time of a
minority carrier with a majority carrier in which a photon is emitted; a direct recombination lifetime. 1∕τr is
the probability of direct recombination per unit time.
Recombination current flows under forward bias
to replenish the carriers recombining in the space
charge (depletion) layer. Typically, it is described by
I = Iro[exp(eV∕2kT) − 1].
Reverse bias is the application of an external voltage
to a pn junction such that the positive terminal is connected to the n-side and the negative to the p-side. The
applied voltage increases the built-in potential.
Reverse saturation current is the reverse current that
would flow in a reverse-biased ideal pn junction obeying the Shockley equation.
Shockley diode equation relates the diode current to
the diode voltage through I = Io[exp(eV∕kT) − 1]. It is
based on the injection and diffusion of injected minority carriers by the application of a forward bias.
Short diode is a pn junction in which the neutral regions are shorter than the minority carrier diffusion
lengths.
Small-signal equivalent circuit of a transistor replaces the transistor with an equivalent circuit that consists of resistances, capacitances, and dependent
sources (current or voltage). The equivalent circuit represents the transistor behavior under small-signal ac
conditions. The batteries are replaced with short circuits (or their internal resistances). Small signals imply
small variations about dc values.
Substrate is a single mechanical support that carries
active and passive devices. For example, in integrated
circuit technology, typically, many integrated circuits
are fabricated on a single silicon crystal wafer that
serves as the substrate.
Thermal generation current is the current that
flows in a reverse-biased pn junction as a result of the
thermal generation of EHPs in the depletion layer that
become separated and swept across by the built-in
field.
Threshold voltage is the gate voltage needed to establish a conducting channel between the source and drain
of an enhancement MOST (metal-oxide-semiconductor
transistor).

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Transistor is a three-terminal solid-state device in
which a current flowing between two electrodes is controlled by the voltage between the third and one of the
other terminals or by a current flowing into the third

Turn-on, or cut-in, voltage of a diode is the voltage
beyond which there is a substantial increase in the current. The turn-on voltage of a Si diode is about 0.6 V
whereas it is about 1 V for a GaAs LED. The turn-on

a forward bias leads to the injection of electrons into the base where they diffuse
toward the collector. The current is proportional to the gradient of the electron
concentration and hence to the reciprocal of the base width W. Why is the hole current

this diagram draw the energy band diagram when the BJT has a forward bias of 0.6 V across the
EB junction and a reverse bias (perhaps 12 V) across the BC junction. How does the collector
current depend on the base width W and how does the current due to holes injected into the emitter (hole contribution to the emitter current) depend on the conductivity of the emitter and the
diffusion coefficient of holes in the emitter? Does your diagram change for common emitter

Dielectric Materials and Insulation

The familiar parallel plate capacitor equation with free space as an insulator is
given by
εo A
C=
d
where εo is the absolute permittivity, A is the plate area, and d is the separation
between the plates. If there is a material medium between the plates, then the capacitance, the charge storage ability per unit voltage, increases by a factor of εr, where
εr is called the dielectric constant of the medium or its relative permittivity. The
increase in the capacitance is due to the polarization of the medium in which
positive and negative charges are displaced with respect to their equilibrium positions. The opposite surfaces of the dielectric medium acquire opposite surface charge
densities that are related to the amount of polarization in the material. An important
concept in dielectric theory is that of an electric dipole moment p, which is a
measure of the electrostatic effects of a pair of opposite charges +Q and −Q separated by a finite distance a, and so is defined by
p = Qa

Although the net charge is zero, this entity still gives rise to an electric field in space
and also interacts with an electric field from other sources. The relative permittivity
is a material property that is frequency dependent. Some capacitors are designed to
work at low frequencies, whereas others have a wide frequency range. Furthermore,
even though they are regarded as energy storage devices, all practical capacitors
exhibit some losses when used in an electric circuit. These losses are no different
than I2R losses in a resistor carrying a current. The power dissipation in a practical
capacitor depends on the frequency, and for some applications it can be an important
factor. A defining property of a dielectric medium is not only its ability to increase
capacitance but also, and equally important, its insulating behavior or low conductivity

so that the charges are not conducted from one plate of the capacitor to the other
through the dielectric. Dielectric materials often serve to insulate current-carrying
conductors or conductors at different voltages. Why can we not simply use air as
insulation between high-voltage conductors? When the electric field inside an insulator exceeds a critical field called the dielectric strength, the medium suffers
dielectric breakdown and a large discharge current flows through the dielectric. Some
40 percent of utility generator failures are linked to insulation failures in the generator. Dielectric breakdown is probably one of the oldest electrical engineering
problems and that which has been most widely studied and never fully explained.

7.1

MATTER POLARIZATION AND RELATIVE
PERMITTIVITY

7.1.1 RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY: DEFINITION
We first consider a parallel plate capacitor with vacuum as the dielectric medium
between the plates, as shown in Figure 7.1a. The plates are connected to a constant
voltage supply V. Let Qo be the charge on the plates. This charge can be easily
measured. The capacitance Co of the parallel plate capacitor in free space, as in
Figure 7.1a, is defined by
Definition of
Capacitance

Co =

Qo
V

[7.1]

The electric field, directed from high to low potential, is defined by the gradient
of the potential E = −dV∕dx. Thus, the electric field E between the plates is just
V∕d where d is the separation of the plates.

the insertion of a medium between the plates.

7 .1

MATTER POLARIZATION AND RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY

661

Consider now what happens when a dielectric slab (a slab of any nonconducting
material) is inserted into this parallel plate capacitor, as shown in Figure 7.1b and c
with V kept the same. During the insertion of the dielectric slab, there is an external
current flow that indicates that there is additional charge being stored on the plates.
The charge on the electrodes increases from Qo to Q. We can easily measure the extra
charge Q − Qo flowing from the battery to the plates by integrating the observed current in the circuit during the process of insertion, as shown in Figure 7.1b. Because
there is now a greater amount of charge stored on the plates, the capacitance of the
system in Figure 7.1c is larger than that in Figure 7.1a by the ratio Q to Qo. The
relative permittivity, or the dielectric constant, εr is defined to reflect this increase
in the capacitance or the charge storage ability by virtue of having a dielectric medium.
If C is the capacitance with the dielectric medium as in Figure 7.1c, then by definition
Q
C

εr =
Qo Co

[7.2]

Definition of

permittivity

The increase in the stored charge is due to the polarization of the dielectric by
the applied field, as explained below. It is important to remember that when the
dielectric medium is inserted, the electric field remains unchanged, provided that the
insulator fills the whole space between the plates as shown in Figure 7.1c. The voltage V remains the same and therefore so does the gradient V∕d, which means that
E remains constant.

7.1.2 DIPOLE MOMENT AND ELECTRONIC POLARIZATION
An electrical dipole moment is simply a separation between a negative and positive
charge of equal magnitude Q as shown in Figure 7.2. If a is the vector from the
negative to the positive charge, the electric dipole moment is defined as a vector by
p = Qa

[7.3]

The region that contains the +Q and −Q charges has zero net charge. Unless
the two charge centers coincide, this region will nonetheless, by virtue of the definition in Equation 7.3, contain a dipole moment.
The net charge within a neutral atom is zero. Furthermore, on average, the center of negative charge of the electrons coincides with the positive nuclear charge,
which means that the atom has no net dipole moment, as indicated in Figure 7.3a.
However, when this atom is placed in an external electric field, it will develop an
induced dipole moment. The electrons, being much lighter than the positive nucleus,
become easily displaced by the field, which results in the separation of the negative
charge center from the positive charge center, as shown in Figure 7.3b. This separation
of negative and positive charges and the resulting induced dipole moment are termed

polarization. An atom is said to be polarized if it possesses an effective dipole
moment, that is, if there is a separation between the centers of negative and positive
charge distributions.
The induced dipole moment depends on the electric field causing it. We define
a quantity called the polarizability α to relate the induced dipole moment pinduced to
the field E causing it,
Definition of
polarizability

pinduced = αE

[7.4]

where α is a coefficient called the polarizability of the atom. It depends on the
polarization mechanism. Since the polarization of a neutral atom involves the displacement of electrons, α is called electronic polarization and denoted as αe. Inasmuch as the electrons in an atom are not rigidly fixed, all atoms possess a certain
amount of electronic polarizability.
In the absence of an electric field, the center of mass C of the orbital motions
of the electrons coincides with the positively charged nucleus O and the electronic
dipole moment is zero as in Figure 7.3a. Suppose that the atom has Z number of
electrons orbiting the nucleus and all the electrons are contained within a certain
sphere region of radius ro. When an electric field E is applied, the light electrons
become displaced in the opposite direction to E so that their center of mass C is
shifted by some distance x with respect to the nucleus at O, which we take to be the
origin as shown in Figure 7.3b. As the electrons are “pushed” away by the applied
field, the Coulombic attraction between the electrons and nuclear charge “pulls in”
the electrons; tries to restore the electron cloud back to its original position. The
force on the electrons, due to E, trying to separate them away from the nuclear charge
is ZeE as shown in Figure 7.3b. The restoring force Fr, which is the Coulombic
attractive force between the electrons and the nucleus, can be taken to be proportional
to the displacement x.1 The restoring force is obviously zero when C coincides with
O(x = 0). We can write Fr = −βx where β is a constant and the negative sign indicates that Fr is always directed toward the nucleus O. In equilibrium, the net force
on the negative charge center is zero as shown in Figure 7.3b,
ZeE = βx

See Example 7.1

from which x is known. Therefore, the magnitude of the induced electronic dipole
moment pe is given by
pe = (Ze)x = (

Z 2e2
E
β )

[7.5]

As expected pe is proportional to the applied field. The electronic dipole moment
in Equation 7.5 is valid under static conditions, that is, when the electric field is a
dc field. The term in the parentheses in Equation 7.5 is the electronic polarizability.
We can use elementary electrostatics to find β by assuming that the negative charge
Ze is uniformly distributed within the atomic radius ro. We can then calculate the
electric field Er at x from center of negative charge C. The force ZeEr on the nucleus
would be pulling the nucleus toward C, which is the same force that pulls the negative charge center C toward O as indicated in Figure 7.3b. We can therefore find β
as shown in Example 7.1, and then substitute for β in Equation 7.5 with the final
result that αe is given by
αe ≈ 4πεor3o

[7.6]

Notice that polarizability depends on the atomic size only in this simple classical
view. Suppose that we suddenly remove the applied electric field polarizing the atom.
There is then only the restoring force −βx, which always acts to pull the electrons
toward the nucleus O. The equation of motion of the negative charge center is then
−βx = Zme

Thus, the displacement at any time is sinusoidal and given by

where

ωo = (

is the oscillation frequency of the center of mass of the electron cloud about the
nucleus and xo is the displacement before the removal of the field. After the removal
of the field, the electronic charge cloud executes simple harmonic motion about the
nucleus with a frequency determined by ωo; called electronic polarization resonance
frequency.2 It is analogous to a mass on a spring being pulled and let go. The system then executes simple harmonic motion. The oscillations of course die out with
time. In the atomic case, a sinusoidal displacement x(t) above implies that the electronic charge cloud has an acceleration that is also sinusoidal with cos(ωot). It is
well known from classical electromagnetism that an accelerating charge radiates
2

The term natural frequency refers to a system’s characteristic frequency of oscillation when it is excited.
A mass attached to a spring and then let go will execute simple harmonic motion with a certain natural frequency
ωo. If we then decide to oscillate this mass with an applied force, the maximum energy transfer will occur when
the applied force has the same frequency as ωo; the system will be put in resonance. ωo is also a resonant
frequency. Strictly, ω = 2πf is the angular frequency and f is the frequency. It is quite common to simply refer
to ω as a frequency because the literature is dominated by ω; the meaning should be obvious within context.

cloud loses energy, and thus its amplitude of oscillations decreases. (Recall that the
average energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the displacement.)

obtain

net negative space charge density ρe is
ρe ≈

−Ze
(4π∕3)r3o

The negative space charge density ρe gives rise to a “restoring” field Er at distance x, as shown
in Figure 7.3b, whose magnitude increases linearly with distance x from the center C of the
negative charge as derived in elementary electrostatics, that is,
Er =

4πεor3o

We had to use −x because x here is measured from O to C whereas in electrostatics x is from
C to O. Er is directed toward C (along x). The force on the nucleus +Ze at x due to this field
is ZeEr, which pulls the nucleus toward C and conversely C toward O; this is the restoring
force Fr. Thus,

the elements in Period 3 from Na to Ar. The dashed

classical theory is Equation 7.6.

and hence the definition of ro in above equations cannot be exact. Nonetheless, Table 7.1 lists
calculated ro values from well-established techniques and available in most tables of periodic
elements. We can plot ae versus r3o as in Figure 7.4. The best line going through the origin
has the functional form,
αe = (3.97 × 10−10 F m−1)r3o

and has a reasonable R2 fit coefficient that confirms the prediction of Equation 7.6. The value
of 4πεo in Equation 7.6 is 1.11 × 10−10 F m−1, which is also shown in Figure 7.4. It is obvious that the classical theory predicts the right functional form but fails to predict the magnitude by a factor of about 3.5 for these elements.3

fo is of the order of 1015 Hz and increases along the period.
While the classical theory falls short on the magnitude of αe, it does help one understand
trends in the Periodic Table, along a period, and down a group for example as explored
further in Question 7.1.

7.1.3 POLARIZATION VECTOR P
When a material is placed in an electric field, the atoms and the molecules of the
material become polarized, so we have a distribution of dipole moments in the material. We can visualize this effect with the insertion of the dielectric slab into the
parallel plate capacitor, as depicted in Figure 7.5a. The placement of the dielectric
slab into an electric field polarizes the molecules in the material. The induced dipole
moments all point in the direction of the field. Consider the polarized medium alone,

The disagreement is sometimes much less egregious and even quite tolerable. The reader, for example, can
try some rare-earth atoms with many electrons. By the way, there are now very sophisticated numerical quantum

tail. Every positive charge has a negative charge next to it and vice versa. There is
therefore no net charge within the bulk. But the positive charges of the dipoles
appearing at the right-hand face are not canceled by negative charges of any dipoles
at this face. There is therefore a surface charge +QP on the right-hand face that
results from the polarization of the medium. Similarly, there is a negative charge
−QP with the same magnitude appearing on the left-hand face due to the negative
charges of the dipoles at this face. We see that charges +QP and −QP appear on the
opposite surfaces of a material when it becomes polarized in an electric field, as
shown in Figure 7.5c. These charges are bound and are a direct result of the polarization of the molecules. They are termed surface polarization charges. Figure 7.5c
emphasizes this aspect of dielectric behavior in an electric field by showing the
dielectric and its polarization charges only.
We represent the polarization of a medium by a quantity called polarization P,
which is defined as the total dipole moment per unit volume,

where p1, p2, . . . , pN are the dipole moments induced at N molecules in the volume.
If pav is the average dipole moment per molecule, then an equivalent definition of
P is
P = Npav

[7.8b]

where N is the number of molecules per unit volume. There is an important relationship, given below, between P and the polarization charges QP on the surfaces of the
dielectric. It should be emphasized for future discussions that if polarization arises
from the effect of the applied field, as shown in Figure 7.5a, which is usually the

case, pav must be the average dipole moment per atom in the direction of the applied
field. In that case we often also denote pav as the induced average dipole moment
per molecule pinduced.
To calculate the polarization P for the polarized dielectric in Figure 7.5b, we need
to sum all the dipoles in the medium and divide by the volume Ad, as in Equation 7.8a.
However, the polarized medium can be simply represented as in Figure 7.5c in terms
of surface charge +QP and −QP, which are separated by the thickness distance d. We
can view this arrangement as one big dipole moment ptotal from −QP to +QP . Thus
ptotal = QPd

Since the polarization is defined as the total dipole moment per unit volume, the
magnitude of P is

But QP∕A is the surface polarization charge density σP, so

[7.9a]

Polarization is a vector and Equation 7.9a only gives its magnitude. For the
rectangular slab in Figure 7.5c, the direction of P is normal to the surface. For +σp
(right face), it comes out from the surface and for −σP (left face), it is directed into
the surface. Although Equation 7.9a is derived for one specific geometry, the rectangular slab, it can be generalized as follows. The charge per unit area appearing
on the surface of a polarized medium is equal to the component of the polarization
vector normal to this surface. If Pnormal is the component of P normal to the surface
where the polarization charge density is σP, as shown in Figure 7.6, then,
Pnormal = σp

[7.9b]

The polarization P induced in a dielectric medium when it is placed in an electric
field depends on the field itself. The induced dipole moment per molecule within the
medium depends on the electric field by virtue of Equation 7.4. To express the dependence of P on the field E, we define a quantity called the electric susceptibility χe by
P = χeεoE

Equation 7.10 shows an effect P due to a cause E and the quantity χe relates the

It is important to recognize the difference between free and polarization (or
bound) charges. The charges stored on the metal plates in Figure 7.5a are free
because they result from the motion of free electrons in the metal. For example both
Qo and Q, before and after the dielectric insertion in Figure 7.1, are free charges that
arrive on the plates from the battery. The polarization charges +QP and −QP, on the
other hand, are bound to the molecules. They cannot move within the dielectric or
on its surface.
The field E before the dielectric was inserted (Figure 7.1a) is given by

[7.12]

where σo = Qo∕A is the free surface charge density without any dielectric medium
between the plates, as in Figure 7.1a.
After the insertion of the dielectric, this field remains the same V∕d, but the free
charges on the plates are different. The free surface charge on the plates is now Q.
In addition there are bound polarization charges on the dielectric surfaces next to
the plates, as shown in Figure 7.5a. It is apparent that the flow of current during the
insertion of the dielectric, Figure 7.1b, is due to the additional free charges Q − Qo
needed on the capacitor plates to neutralize the opposite polarity polarization charges
QP appearing on the dielectric surfaces. The total charge (see Figure 7.5a) due to
that on the plate plus that appearing on the dielectric surface, Q − QP , must be the
same as before, Qo, so that the field, as given by Equation 7.12, does not change
inside the dielectric, that is,
Q − QP = Qo

or
Q = Qo + QP

Dividing by A, defining σ = Q∕A as the free surface charge density on the plates
with the dielectric inserted, and using Equation 7.12, we obtain
σ = εoE + σP

7 .1

MATTER POLARIZATION AND RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY

669

Since σP = P and P = χeεoE, Equations 7.9 and 7.10, we can eliminate σP to
obtain
σ = εo(1 + χe)E

From the definition of the relative permittivity in Equation 7.2 we have
εr =

so substituting for σ and using Equation 7.12 we obtain

[7.14]

The significance of Equation 7.14 is that it relates the microscopic polarization
mechanism that determines αe to the macroscopic property εr.

7.1.4 LOCAL FIELD Eloc AND CLAUSIUS–MOSSOTTI EQUATION
Equation 7.14, which relates εr to electronic polarizability αe is only approximate
because it assumes that the field acting on an individual atom or molecule is the field
E, which is assumed to be uniform within the dielectric. In other words, the induced
polarization, pinduced ∝ E. However, the induced polarization depends on the actual
field experienced by the molecule. It is apparent from Figure 7.5a that there are
polarized molecules within the dielectric with their negative and positive charges
separated so that the field is not constant on the atomic scale as we move through
the dielectric. This is depicted in Figure 7.7. The field experienced by an individual
molecule is actually different than E, which represents the average field in the dielectric. As soon as the dielectric becomes polarized, the field at some arbitrary point
depends not only on the charges on the plates (Q) but also on the orientations of all
Figure 7.7 The electric field inside a polarized
dielectric at the atomic scale is not uniform.
The local field is the actual field that acts on a
molecule. It can be calculated by removing that
molecule and evaluating the field at that point

surrounding the point.

the other dipoles around this point in the dielectric. When averaged over some distance, say a few thousand molecules, this field becomes E, as shown in Figure 7.7.
The actual field experienced by a molecule in a dielectric is defined as the
local field and denoted by Eloc. It depends not only on the free charges on the
plates but also on the arrangement of all the polarized molecules around this point.
In evaluating Eloc we simply remove the molecule from this point and calculate the
field at this point coming from all sources, including neighboring polarized molecules, as visualized in Figure 7.7. Eloc will depend on the amount of polarization
the material has experienced. The greater the polarization, the greater is the local
field because there are bigger dipoles around this point. Eloc depends on the
arrangement of polarized molecules around the point of interest and hence depends
on the crystal structure. In the simplest case of a material with a cubic crystal
structure, or a liquid (no crystal structure), the local field Eloc acting on a molecule
increases with polarization as4

Equation 7.15 is called the Lorentz field. The induced polarization in the molecule now depends on this local field Eloc rather than the average field E. Thus
pinduced = αeEloc

The fundamental definition of electric susceptibility by the equation
P = χeεoE

is unchanged, which means that εr = 1 + χe, Equation 7.13, remains intact. The
polarization is defined by P = Npinduced, and pinduced can be related to Eloc and hence
to E and P. Then
P = (εr − 1)εoE

can be used to eliminate E and P and obtain a relationship between εr and αe. This
is the Clausius–Mossotti equation,

7.2

ELECTRONIC POLARIZATION: COVALENT SOLIDS

When a field is applied to a solid substance, the constituent atoms or molecules
become polarized, as we visualized in Figure 7.5a. The electron clouds within each
atom become shifted by the field, and this gives rise to electronic polarization. This
type of electronic polarization within an atom, however, is quite small compared
with the polarization due to the valence electrons in the covalent bonds within the
solid. For example, in crystalline silicon, there are electrons shared with neighboring
Si atoms in covalent bonds, as shown in Figure 7.8a. These valence electrons form
bonds (i.e., become shared) between the Si atoms because they are already loosely
bound to their parent atoms. If this were not the case, the solid would be a van der
Waals solid with atoms held together by secondary bonds (e.g., solid Ar below 83.8 K).

becomes polarized due to the collective shift in
the negative charge distribution of the valence
electrons.

672

CHAPTER 7

∙

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

In the covalent solid, the valence electrons therefore are not rigidly tied to the ionic
cores left in the Si atoms. Although intuitively we often view these valence electrons
as living in covalent bonds between the ionic Si cores, they nonetheless belong to
the whole crystal because they can tunnel from bond to bond and exchange places
with each other. We refer to their wavefunctions as delocalized, that is, not localized
to any particular Si atom. When an electric field is applied, the negative charge
distribution associated with these valence electrons becomes readily shifted with
respect to the positive charges of the ionic Si cores, as depicted in Figure 7.8b and
the crystal exhibits polarization, or develops a polarization vector. One can appreciate the greater flexibility of electrons in covalent bonds compared with those in
individual ionic cores by comparing the energy involved in freeing each. It takes
perhaps 1–2 eV to break a covalent bond to free the valence electron, but it takes
more than 10 eV to free an electron from an individual ionic Si core. Thus, the
valence electrons in the bonds readily respond to an applied field and become displaced. This type of electronic polarization, due to the displacement of electrons in
covalent bonds, is responsible for the large dielectric constants of covalent crystals.
For example εr = 11.9 for the Si crystal and εr = 16 for the Ge crystal.

This is larger, for example, than the electronic polarizability of an isolated Ar atom,
which has more electrons. If we were to take the inner electrons in each Si atom as very
roughly representing Ne, we would expect their contribution to the overall electronic
polarizability to be roughly the same as the Ne atom, which is 0.45 × 10−40 F m2.

associated with electromagnetic waves of wavelength in the ultraviolet region.

7.3

POLARIZATION MECHANISMS

In addition to electronic polarization, we can identify a number of other polarization
mechanisms that may also contribute to the relative permittivity.

7.3.1 IONIC POLARIZATION
This type of polarization occurs in ionic crystals such as NaCl, KCl, and LiBr. The
ionic crystal has distinctly identifiable ions, for example, Na+ and Cl−, located at
well-defined lattice sites, so each pair of oppositely charged neighboring ions has a
dipole moment. As an example, we consider the one-dimensional NaCl crystal
depicted as a chain of alternating Na+ and Cl− ions in Figure 7.9a. In the absence
of an applied field, the solid has no net polarization because the dipole moments of
equal magnitude are lined up head to head and tail to tail so that the net dipole
moment is zero. The dipole moment p+ in the positive x direction has the same

magnitude as p− in the negative x direction, so the net dipole moment
pnet = p+ − p− = 0

In the presence of a field E along the x direction, however, the Cl− ions are pushed
in the −x direction and the Na+ ions in the +x direction about their equilibrium
positions. Consequently, the dipole moment p+ in the +x direction increases to p′+
and the dipole moment p− decreases to p′−, as shown in Figure 7.9b. The net dipole
moment is now no longer zero. The net dipole moment, or the average dipole
moment, per ion pair is now (p′+ − p′−), which depends on the electric field E. Thus
the induced average dipole moment per ion pair pav depends on the field E. The ionic
polarizability αi is defined in terms of the local field experienced by the ions,
Ionic
polarizability

pav = αiEloc

[7.17]

The larger the αi, the greater the induced dipole moment. Generally, αi is larger
than the electronic polarizability αe by a factor of 10 or more, which leads to ionic
solids having large dielectric constants. The polarization P exhibited by the ionic
solid is therefore given by
P = Ni pav = Ni αi Eloc

where Ni is the number of ion pairs per unit volume. By relating the local field to
E and using

[7.18]

Each ion also has a core of electrons that become displaced in the presence of
an applied field with respect to their positive nuclei and therefore also contribute to
the polarization of the solid. This electronic polarization simply adds to the ionic
polarization. Its magnitude is invariably much smaller than the ionic contribution in
these solids.

7.3.2 ORIENTATIONAL (DIPOLAR) POLARIZATION
Certain molecules possess permanent dipole moments. For example, the HCl molecule shown in Figure 7.10a has a permanent dipole moment po from the Cl− ion to
the H+ ion. In the liquid or gas phases, these molecules, in the absence of an electric
field, are randomly oriented as a result of thermal agitation, as shown in Figure 7.10b.
When an electric field E is applied, E tries to align the dipoles parallel to itself, as
depicted in Figure 7.10c. The Cl− and H+ charges experience forces in opposite
directions. But the nearly rigid bond between Cl− and H+ holds them together, which
means that the molecule experiences a torque τ about its center of mass.5 This torque
acts to rotate the molecule to align po with E. If all the molecules were to simply

The oppositely directed forces also slightly stretch the Cl−–H+ bond, but we neglect this effect.

average dipole moment per molecule along the field.

rotate and align with the field, the polarization of the solid would be
P = Npo

where N is the number of molecules per unit volume. However, due to their thermal
energy, the molecules move around randomly and collide with each other and with
the walls of the container. These collisions destroy the dipole alignments. Thus the
thermal energy tries to randomize the orientations of the dipole moments. A snapshot of
the dipoles in the material in the presence of a field can be pictured as in Figure 7.10d
in which the dipoles have different orientations. There is, nonetheless, a net average
dipole moment per molecule pav that is finite and directed along the field. Thus the
material exhibits net polarization, which leads to a dielectric constant that is determined
by this orientational polarization.
To find the induced average dipole moment pav along E, we need to know the
average potential energy Edip of a dipole placed in a field E and how this compares
with the average thermal energy 52 kT per molecule as in the present case of five
degrees of freedom. Edip represents the average external work done by the field in
aligning the dipoles with the field. If 52 kT is much greater than Edip, then the average
thermal energy of collisions will prevent any dipole alignment with the field. If,
however, Edip is much greater than 52 kT , then the thermal energy is insufficient to
destroy the dipole alignments.
A dipole at an angle θ to the field experiences a torque τ that tries to rotate it,
as shown in Figure 7.10c. Work done dW by the field in rotating the dipole by dθ
is τ dθ (as in F dx). This work dW represents a small change dE in the potential
energy of the dipole. No work is done if the dipole is already aligned with E, when
θ = 0, which corresponds to the minimum in PE. On the other hand, maximum work
is done when the torque has to rotate the dipole from θ = 180° to θ = 0° (either

dipole, according to Figure 7.10c, is given by

The average dipole potential energy is then 12 Emax or poE. For orientational polarization to be effective, this energy must be greater than the average thermal energy.
The average dipole moment pav along E is directly proportional to the magnitude of
po itself and also proportional to the average dipole energy to average thermal energy
ratio, that is,

If we were to do the calculation properly using Boltzmann statistics for the

dipole has an energy E is proportional to exp(−E∕kT ), then we would find that when
poE < kT (generally the case),
2
1 po E
pav =

3 kT
It turns out that the intuitively derived expression for pav is roughly the same as
Equation 7.19. Strictly, of course, we should use the local field acting on each molecule, in which case E is simply replaced by Eloc. From Equation 7.19 we can define
a dipolar orientational polarizability αd per molecule by
2

αd =

1 po
3 kT

[7.20]

It is apparent that, in contrast to the electronic and ionic polarization, dipolar
orientational polarization is strongly temperature dependent. αd decreases with temperature, which means that the relative permittivity εr also decreases with temperature. Dipolar orientational polarization is normally exhibited by polar liquids (e.g.,
water, alcohol, acetone, and various electrolytes) and polar gases (e.g., gaseous HCl
and steam). It can also occur in solids if there are permanent dipoles within the solid
structure, even if dipolar rotation involves a discrete jump of an ion from one site
to another, such as in various glasses.

7.3.3 INTERFACIAL POLARIZATION
Interfacial polarization occurs whenever there is an accumulation of charge at an
interface between two materials or between two regions within a material. The simplest
example is interfacial polarization due to the accumulation of charges in the dielectric

presence of an applied field, the mobile positive ions migrate toward the negative electrode and accumulate
there. There is now an overall separation between the negative charges and positive charges in the dielectric.
The dielectric therefore exhibits interfacial polarization. (c) Grain boundaries and interfaces between different
materials frequently give rise to interfacial polarization. In this simple example, electrons and holes within
grains drift and become trapped at the grain boundaries. (d) Positive and negative ions within a grain boundary
can jump to neighboring vacant sites, aided by the field, and thereby form dipoles within the grain boundary.

near one of the electrodes, as depicted in Figure 7.11a and b. Invariably materials,
however perfect, contain crystal defects, impurities, and various mobile charge carriers such as electrons (e.g., from donor-type impurities), holes, or ionized host or
impurity ions. In the particular example in Figure 7.11a, the material has an equal
number of positive ions and negative ions, but the positive ions are assumed to be
far more mobile. For example, if present, the H+ ion (which is a proton) and the Li+
ion in ceramics and glasses are more mobile than negative ions in the structure
because they are relatively small. Under the presence of an applied field, these
positive ions migrate to the negative electrode. The positive ions, however, cannot
leave the dielectric and enter the crystal structure of the metal electrode. They therefore simply pile up at the interface and give rise to a positive space charge near the
electrode. These positive charges at the interface attract more electrons to the negative electrode. This additional charge on the electrode, of course, appears as an
increase in the dielectric constant. The term interfacial polarization arises because
the positive charges accumulating at the interface and the remainder of negative
charges in the bulk together constitute dipole moments that appear in the polarization
vector P (P sums all the dipoles within the material per unit volume).
Another typical interfacial polarization mechanism is the trapping of electrons or
holes at defects at the crystal surface, at the interface between the crystal and the
electrode. In this case we can view the positive charges in Figure 7.11a as holes and
negative charges as immobile ionized acceptors. We assume that the contacts are
blocking and do not allow electrons or holes to be injected, that is, exchanged between
the electrodes and the dielectric. In the presence of a field, the holes drift to the
negative electrode and become trapped in defects at the interface, as in Figure 7.11b.
Grain boundaries frequently lead to interfacial polarization as they can trap
charges migrating under the influence of an applied field, as indicated in Figure 7.11c.
In this example, free electrons and holes within the grains have drifted and then
become trapped at grain boundaries. The result is the development of charges on

grain surfaces and hence polarization charges on the dielectric surfaces next to the
electrodes as in Figure 7.11c. If there are no free carriers to drift within the grains,
there may be trapped charges, even charged impurities, within the grain boundaries.
Aided by the field, the charges can jump to neighboring vacant sites to form dipoles
within the grain boundaries as depicted in Figure 7.11d. In both Figure 7.11c and
d, interfacial polarization leads to polarization charges appearing on the surfaces next
to the electrodes. Interfaces also arise in heterogeneous dielectric materials, for
example, when there is a dispersed phase within a continuous phase. The principle
is then the same as schematically illustrated in Figure 7.11c.

In the presence of electronic, ionic, and dipolar polarization mechanisms, the average
induced dipole moment per molecule will be the sum of all the contributions in terms
of the local field,
pav = αe Eloc + αi Eloc + αd Eloc
Each effect adds linearly to the net dipole moment per molecule, a fact verified
by experiments. Interfacial polarization cannot be simply added to the above equation
as αif Eloc because it occurs at interfaces and cannot be put into an average polarization per molecule in the bulk. Further, the fields are not well defined at the interfaces.
In addition, we cannot use the simple Lorentz local field approximation for dipolar
materials. That is, the Clausius–Mossotti equation does not work with dipolar dielectrics and the calculation of the local field is quite complicated. The dielectric constant εr under electronic and ionic polarizations, however, can be obtained from

FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE: DIELECTRIC CONSTANT AND DIELECTRIC LOSS

IONIC AND ELECTRONIC POLARIZABILITY Consider the CsCl crystal which has one Cs+–Cl−

pair per unit cell and a lattice parameter a of 0.412 nm. The electronic polarizability of Cs+
and Cl− ions is 2.7 × 10−40 F m2 and 4.0 × 10−40 F m2, respectively, and the mean ionic
polarizability per ion pair is 5.8 × 10−40 F m2. What is the dielectric constant at low frequencies and that at optical frequencies?
SOLUTION

The CsCl structure has one cation (Cs+) and one anion (Cl−) in the unit cell. Given the lattice parameter a = 0.412 × 10−9 m, the number of ion pairs Ni per unit volume is 1∕a3 = 1∕
(0.412 × 10−9 m) 3 = 1.43 × 1028 m−3. Ni is also the concentration of cations and anions
individually. From the Clausius–Mossotti equation,
εr − 1
1
=
[Niαe (Cs + ) + Niαe (CI− ) + Niαi ]
εr + 2 3εo

That is,
εr − 1 (1.43 × 1028 m−3 ) (2.7 × 10−40 + 4.0 × 10−40 + 5.8 × 10−40 F m2 )
=
εr + 2
3(8.85 × 10−12 F m−1 )

Solving for εr, we find εr = 7.18.
At high frequencies—that is, near-optical frequencies—the ionic polarization is too sluggish to allow ionic polarization to contribute to εr. Thus, εrop, relative permittivity at optical
frequencies, is given by
εrop − 1
εrop + 2

=

1
[Niαe (Cs + ) + Niαe (Cl−1 ) ]
3εo

That is,
εrop − 1

(1.43 × 1028 m−3 ) (2.7 × 10−40 + 4.0 × 10−40 F m2 )
3(8.85 × 10−12 F m−1 )

Solving for εrop, we find εrop = 2.69. This very close to the experimental value εrop = 2.62.
The low frequency experimental value for εr is 7.20, but this is normally used to deduce αi.

FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE: DIELECTRIC
CONSTANT AND DIELECTRIC LOSS

7.4.1 DIELECTRIC LOSS
The static dielectric constant is an effect of polarization under dc conditions. When
the applied field, or the voltage across a parallel plate capacitor, is a sinusoidal
signal, then the polarization of the medium under these ac conditions leads to an ac
dielectric constant that is generally different than the static case. As an example we
will consider orientational polarization involving dipolar molecules. The sinusoidally
varying field changes magnitude and direction continuously, and it tries to line up
the dipoles one way and then the other way and so on. If the instantaneous induced
dipole moment p per molecule can instantaneously follow the field variations, then

679

at any instant
p = αd E

[7.22]

and the polarizability αd has its expected maximum value from dc conditions, that is,
αd =

p2o
3kT

[7.23]

There are two factors opposing the immediate alignment of the dipoles with the
field. First is that thermal agitation tries to randomize the dipole orientations. Collisions in the gas phase, random jolting from lattice vibrations in the liquid and solid
phases, for example, aid the randomization of the dipole orientations. Second, the
molecules rotate in a viscous medium by virtue of their interactions with neighbors,
which is particularly strong in the liquid and solid states and means that the dipoles
cannot respond instantaneously to the changes in the applied field. If the field
changes too rapidly, then the dipoles cannot follow the field and, as a consequence,
remain randomly oriented. At high frequencies, therefore, αd will be zero as the field
cannot induce a dipole moment. At low frequencies, of course, the dipoles can
respond rapidly to follow the field and αd has its maximum value. It is clear that αd
changes from its maximum value in Equation 7.23 to zero as the frequency of the
field is increased. We need to find the behavior of αd as a function of frequency ω
so that we can determine the dielectric constant εr by the Clausius–Mossotti equation.
Suppose that after a prolonged application, corresponding to dc conditions, the
applied field across the dipolar gaseous medium is suddenly decreased from Eo to
E at a time we define as zero, as shown in Figure 7.12. The field E is smaller than
Eo, so the induced dc dipole moment per molecule should be smaller and given by
αd(0)E where αd(0) is αd at ω = 0, dc conditions. Therefore, the induced dipole
moment per molecule has to decrease, or relax, from αd(0)Eo to αd(0)E. In a gas
medium the molecules would be moving around randomly and their collisions with
each other and the walls of the container randomize the induced dipole per molecule.
Thus the decrease, or the relaxation process, in the induced dipole moment is
Figure 7.12 The applied dc field is suddenly changed from
Eo to E at time t = 0.
The induced dipole moment p has to decrease from αd (0)Eo
to a final value of αd (0)E. The decrease is achieved by random
collisions of molecules in the gas.

achieved by random collisions. Assuming that τ is the average time, called the relaxation time, between molecular collisions, then this is the mean time it takes per
molecule to randomize the induced dipole moment. If p is the instantaneous induced
dipole moment, then p − αd(0)E is the excess dipole moment, which must eventually
disappear to zero through random collisions as t → ∞. It would take an average τ
seconds to eliminate the excess dipole moment p − αd (0)E. The rate at which the
induced dipole moment is changing is then −[p − αd(0)E ]∕τ, where the negative
sign represents a decrease. Thus,

Although we did not derive Equation 7.24 rigorously, it is nonetheless a good
first-order description of the behavior of the induced dipole moment per molecule
in a dipolar medium. Equation 7.24 can be used to obtain the dipolar polarizability
under ac conditions. For an ac field, we would write
E = Eo sin(ωt)

and solve Equation 7.24, but in engineering we prefer to use an exponential representation for the field
E = Eo exp( jωt)

as in ac voltages. In this case the impedance of a capacitor C and an inductor L
become 1∕jωC and jωL, where j represents a phase shift of 90°. With E = Eo exp( jωt)

and represents the orientational polarizability under ac field conditions. Polarizability αd (ω) is a complex number that indicates that p and E are out of phase.6 Put
differently, if N is the number of molecules per unit volume, P = Np and E are out
of phase, as indicated in Figure 7.13a. At low frequencies, ωτ ≪ 1, αd (ω) is nearly
αd (0), and p is in phase with E. The rate of relaxation 1∕τ is much faster than the
frequency of the field or the rate at which the polarization is being changed; p then
closely follows E. At very high frequencies, ωτ ≫ 1, the rate of relaxation 1∕τ is
much slower than the frequency of the field and p can no longer follow the variations
in the field.

The polarization P lags behind E by some angle ϕ, that is determined by Equation 7.26 as shown in Figure 7.13.

Complex

We can easily obtain the dielectric constant εr from αd (ω) by using Equation 7.14,
which then leads to a complex number for εr since αd itself is a complex number.
By convention, we generally write the complex dielectric constant as
εr = ε′r − jε″r

where ε′r is the real part and ε″r is the imaginary part, both being frequency dependent,
as shown in Figure 7.13b. The real part ε′r decreases from its maximum value ε′r(0),
corresponding to αd (0), to 1 at high frequencies when αd = 0 as ω → ∞ in Equation 7.26. The imaginary part ε″r(ω) is zero at low and high frequencies but peaks
when ωτ = 1 or when ω = 1∕τ. The real part ε′r represents the relative permittivity
that we would use in calculating the capacitance, as for example in C = εr εo A∕d.
The imaginary part ε″r(ω) represents the energy lost in the dielectric medium as the
dipoles are oriented against random collisions one way and then the other way and
so on by the field. Consider the capacitor in Figure 7.14, which has this dielectric
medium between the plates. Then the admittance Y, i.e., the reciprocal of impedance
of this capacitor, with εr given in Equation 7.27 is

is a real number just as if we had a conductive medium with some conductance GP
or resistance 1∕GP. The admittance of the dielectric medium according to Equation 7.28 is a parallel combination of an ideal, or lossless, capacitor C, with a relative permittivity ε′r, and a resistance of RP = 1∕GP as indicated in Figure 7.14. Thus
the dielectric medium behaves as if Co and RP were in parallel. There is no real
electric power dissipated in C, but there is indeed real power dissipated in RP because
Input power = IV = YV 2 = jωCV 2 +

V2
RP

and the second term is real. Thus the power dissipated in the dielectric medium is
related to ε″r and peaks when ω = 1∕τ. The rate of energy storage by the field is
determined by ω whereas the rate of energy transfer to molecular collisions is determined by 1∕τ. When ω = 1∕τ, the two processes, energy storage by the field and
energy transfer to random collisions, are then occurring at the same rate, and hence
energy is being transferred to heat most efficiently. The peak in ε″r versus ω is called
a relaxation peak, which is at a frequency when the dipole relaxations are at
the right rate for maximum power dissipation. This process is known as dielectric
resonance.
According to Equation 7.28, the magnitude of GP and hence the energy loss is
determined by ε″r. In engineering applications of dielectrics in capacitors, we would
like to minimize ε″r for a given ε′r. We define the relative magnitude of ε″r with respect
to ε′r through a quantity, tan δ, called the loss tangent (or loss factor), as
tan δ =

ε″r
ε′r

[7.31]

which is frequency dependent and peaks just beyond ω = 1∕τ. The actual value of
1∕τ depends on the material, but typically for liquid and solid media it is in the
gigahertz range, that is, microwave frequencies. We can easily find the energy per
unit time—power—dissipated as dielectric loss in the medium. The resistance RP

[7.32]

Equation 7.32 represents the power dissipated per unit volume in the polarization
mechanism: energy lost per unit time to random molecular collisions as heat. It is
clear that dielectric loss is influenced by three factors: ω, E, and tan δ.
Although we considered only orientational polarization, in general a dielectric
medium will also exhibit other polarization mechanisms and certainly electronic
polarization since there will always be electron clouds around individual atoms, or
electrons in covalent bonds. If we were to consider the ionic polarizability in ionic
solids, we would also find αI to be frequency dependent and a complex number. In
this case, lattice vibrations in the crystal, typically at frequencies ωI in the infrared
region of the electromagnetic spectrum, will dissipate the energy stored in the
induced dipole moments just as energy was dissipated by molecular collisions in the
gaseous dipolar medium. Thus, the energy loss will be greatest when the frequency
of the polarizing field is the same as the lattice vibration frequency, ω = ωI, which
tries to randomize the polarization.
We can represent the general features of the frequency dependence of the real
and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant as in Figure 7.15. Although the figure
shows distinctive peaks in ε″r and transition features in ε′r, in reality these peaks and
various features are broader. First, there is no single well-defined lattice vibration
frequency but instead an allowed range of frequencies just as in solids where there
is an allowed range of energies for the electron. Moreover, the polarization effects

depend on the crystal orientation. In the case of polycrystalline materials, various
peaks in different directions overlap to exhibit a broadened overall peak. At low
frequencies the interfacial or space charge polarization features are even broader
because there can be a number of conduction mechanisms (different species of
charge carriers and different carrier mobilities) for the charges to accumulate at
interfaces, each having its own speed. Orientational polarization, especially in many
liquid dielectrics at room temperature, typically takes place at radio to microwave
frequencies. In some polymeric materials, this type of polarization involves a limited
rotation of dipolar side groups attached to the polymeric chain and can occur at much
lower frequencies depending on the temperature. Figure 7.16 shows two typical
examples of dielectric behavior, ε′r and ε″r as a function of frequency, for a polymer
(PET) and an ionic crystal (KCl). Both exhibit loss peaks, peaks in ε″r versus frequency, but for different reasons. The particular polymer, PET (a polyester), exhibits
orientational polarization due to dipolar side groups, whereas KCl exhibits ionic
polarization due to the displacement of K+ and Cl− ions. The frequency of the loss
peak in the case of orientational polarization is highly temperature dependent. For
the PET example in Figure 7.16 at 115 °C, the peak occurs at around 400 Hz, even
below typical radio frequencies.

SOLUTION

We consider the equivalent circuit in Figure 7.14. The power loss in the capacitor is due to
RP. If V is the rms value of the voltage across the capacitor, then the power dissipated per

or
Wcap = V 2ω tan δ

As tan δ is frequency dependent and peaks at some frequency, so does the power dissipated per unit capacitance. A clear design objective would be to keep Wcap as small as
possible. Further, for a given voltage, Wcap does not depend on the dielectric geometry. For
a given voltage and capacitance, we therefore cannot reduce the power dissipation by simply
changing the dimensions of the dielectric.
Consider the rms currents through RP and C, Iloss and Icap, respectively, and their ratio,7

The phase angle between Icap and Itotal is determined by the negative of the phase of the
denominator term (1 − j tan δ). Thus the phase angle between Icap and Itotal is δ, where Icap
leads Itotal by δ. δ is also called the loss angle. When the loss angle is zero, Icap and Itotal are
equal and there is no loss in the dielectric.

SOLUTION

The power dissipated at a given voltage per unit capacitance depends only on ω tan δ, so we
do not need to use ε′r. Calculating ω tan δ or (2πf ) tan δ, we find the values listed in the
table at 60 Hz and 1 MHz. At 60 Hz, polycarbonate has the lowest power dissipation per unit
capacitance, but at 1 MHz it is silicone rubber.
DIELECTRIC LOSS AND FREQUENCY Calculate the heat generated per second due to
dielectric loss per cm3 of cross-linked polyethylene, XLPE (typical power cable insulator),
and alumina, Al2O3 (typical substrate in thin- and thick-film electronics), at 60 Hz and 1 MHz
at a field of 100 kV cm−1. Their properties are given in Table 7.4. What is your conclusion?
SOLUTION

The power dissipated per unit volume is
Wvol = (2π f )E 2εoε′r tan δ

We can calculate Wvol by substituting the properties of individual dielectrics at the given
frequency f. For example, for XLPE at 60 Hz,
Wvol = (2π60 Hz)(100 × 103 × 102 V m−1)2(8.85 × 10−12 F m−1)(2.3)(3 × 10−4)
= 230 W m−3

We can convert this into per cm3 by
W′vol =

Wvol
106

= 0.230 mW cm−3

which is shown in Table 7.4.
From similar calculations we can obtain the heat generated per second per cm3 as shown
in Table 7.4. The heats at 60 Hz are small. The thermal conductivity of the insulation and
its connecting electrodes can remove the heat without substantially increasing the temperature
of the insulation. At 1 MHz, the heats generated are not trivial. One has to remove 5.12 W
of heat from 1 cm3 of XLPE and 47.3 W from 1 cm3 of alumina. The thermal conductivity
κ of XLPE is about 0.005 W cm−1 K−1, whereas that of alumina is almost 100 times larger,
0.33 W cm−1 K−1. The poor thermal conductivity of polyethylene means that 5.12 W of heat
cannot be conducted away easily and it will raise the temperature of the insulation until
dielectric breakdown ensues. In the case of alumina, 47.3 W of heat will substantially increase
the temperature. Dielectric loss is the mechanism by which microwave ovens heat food.
Dielectric heating at high frequencies is used in industrial applications such as heating plastics
and drying wood.

Consider a dipolar dielectric in which there are both orientational and electronic polarizations, αd and αe, respectively, contributing to the overall polarizability. Electronic polarization αe will be independent of frequency over the typical frequency range of operation
of a dipolar dielectric, well below optical frequencies. At high frequencies, orientational
polarization will be too sluggish too respond, αd = 0, and the εr will be εr∞. (The
subscript “infinity” simply means high frequencies where orientational polarization is

Equations 7.34a and b reflect the behavior of ε′r and ε″r as a function of frequency
shown in Figure 7.13b. The imaginary part ε″r that represents the dielectric loss
exhibits a peak at ω = 1∕τ which is called a Debye loss peak. Many dipolar gases
and some liquids with dipolar molecules exhibit this type of behavior. In the case
of solids the peak is typically much broader because we cannot represent the losses
in terms of just one single well-defined relaxation time τ; the relaxation in the solid
is usually represented by a distribution of relaxation times. Further, the simple relaxation process that is described in Equation 7.25 assumes that the dipoles do not
influence each other either through their electric fields or through their interactions
with the lattice; that is, they are not coupled. In solids, the dipoles can also couple,
which complicates the relaxation process. Nonetheless, there are also many solids
whose dielectric relaxation can be approximated by a nearly Debye relaxation or by
slightly modifying Equation 7.33.

This simple relationship is used because the Lorentz local field equation does not apply in dipolar dielectrics
and the local field problem is particularly complicated in these dielectrics.

FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE: DIELECTRIC CONSTANT AND DIELECTRIC LOSS

Peter Debye (1884–1966) received the 1936 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry “for his contributions to our
knowledge of molecular structure through his
investigations on dipole moments and on the
diffraction of X-rays and electrons in gases.” The
Debye heat capacity of solids was described in
Chapter 4, and represents one of his many other
contributions. Courtesy of the Division of Rare and

In dielectric studies of materials it is quite common to find a plot of the imaginary
part (ε″r ) versus the real part (ε′r) as a function of frequency ω. Such plots are called
Cole–Cole plots after their originators. The Debye Equations 7.34a and b obviously
provide the necessary values for ε′r and ε″r to be plotted for the present simple dipolar
relaxation mechanism that has only a single relaxation time τ. In fact, by simply putting
in τ = 1 second, we can calculate and plot ε″r versus ε′r for ω = 0 (dc) to ω → ∞ as
shown in Figure 7.17. The result is a semicircle. While for certain substances, such as
gases and some liquids, the Cole–Cole plots do indeed generate a semicircle, for many
dielectrics, the curve is typically flattened and asymmetric, and not a semicircle.9
The Debye equations lead to a particular RC circuit representation of a dielectric
material that is quite useful. Suppose that we have a resistance Rs in series with a
capacitor Cs, both of which are in parallel with the capacitor C∞ as in Figure 7.18.
9

The departure is simply due to the fact that a simple relaxation process with a single relaxation time cannot
describe the dielectric behavior accurately. (A good overview of non-Debye relaxations is given by Andrew
Jonscher in J Phys D, 32, R57, 1999.)

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

If we were to write down the equivalent admittance of this circuit, we would find
that it corresponds to Equation 7.33, that is, the Debye equation. (The circuit mathematics is straightforward and is not reproduced here.) The reader may wonder why
this circuit is different than the general model shown in Figure 7.14. Any series Rs
and Cs circuit can be transformed to be equivalent to a parallel Rp and Cp (or Gp and
C in Figure 7.14) circuit as is well known in circuit theory; the relationships between
the elements depend on the frequency. Many electrolytic capacitors are frequently
represented by an equivalent series Rs and Cs circuit as in Figure 7.18. If A is the
area and d is the thickness of a parallel plate capacitor with a dipolar dielectric, then

Notice that in this circuit model, Rs, Cs, and C∞ do not depend on the frequency,
which is only true for an ideal Debye dielectric, that with a single relaxation time τ.

NEARLY DEBYE RELAXATION There are some dielectric solids that exhibit nearly Debye

relaxation. One example is the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 ceramic whose relaxation peak and Cole–Cole
plots are similar to those shown in Figures 7.13b and 7.17,10 especially in the high-frequency
range past the resonance peak. La0.7Sr0.3MnO3’s low frequency (εrdc) and high frequency (εr∞)
dielectric constants are 3.6 and 2.58, respectively, where low and high refer, respectively, to
frequencies far below and above the Debye relaxation peak, i.e., εrdc and εr∞. The Debye loss
peak occurs at 6 kHz. Calculate ε′r and the dielectric loss factor tan δ at 29 kHz.
SOLUTION

The loss peak occurs when ωo = 1∕τ, so that τ = 1∕ωo = 1∕(2π6000) = 26.5 μs. We can
now calculate the real and imaginary parts of εr at 29 kHz,

where α and β are constants, typically less than unity (setting α = β = 1 generates the Debye
equations). Such equations are useful in engineering for predicting εr at any frequency from
a few known values at various frequencies, as highlighted in this simple nearly Debye example. Further, if τ dependence on the temperature T is known (often τ is thermally activated),
then we can predict εr at any ω and T.

GAUSS’S LAW AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

An important fundamental theorem in electrostatics is Gauss’s law, which relates the
integration of the electric field over a surface to the total charge enclosed. It can be
derived from Coulomb’s law, or the latter can be derived from Gauss’s law. Suppose
En is the electric field normal to a small surface area dA on a closed surface, as
shown in Figure 7.19; then summing En dA products over the whole surface gives
total net charge Qtotal inside it,
Qtotal
[7.37]
En d A =
∮Surface
εo
where the circle on the integral sign represents integrating over the whole surface
(any shape) enclosing the charges constituting Qtotal as shown in Figure 7.19. The
total charge Qtotal includes all charges, both free charges and bound polarization
charges. Gauss’s law is one of the most useful laws for calculating electric fields in
electrostatics, more so than the Coulomb law with which the reader is probably more
familiar. The surface can be of any shape as long as it contains the charges. We
generally choose convenient surfaces to simplify the integral in Equation 7.37, and
these convenient surfaces are called Gauss surfaces. It should be noted from Figure
7.19 that the field En is coming out from the surface.
As an example, we can consider the field in the parallel plate capacitor in Figure
7.20a with no dielectric medium. We draw a thin rectangular Gauss surface (a hypothetical surface) just enclosing the positive electrode that contains the free charges +Qo
on the plate. The field Eo is normal to the inner face (area A) of the Gauss surface.
Further, we can assume that Eo is uniform across the plate surface, which means that
the integral of En dA in Equation 7.37 over the surface is simply Eo A. There is no field
on the other faces of this rectangular Gauss surface. Then from Equation 7.37,
Eo A =

Eo = V∕d and Qo = CV.
An important application of Gauss’s law is determining what happens at boundaries between dielectric materials. The simplest example is the insertion of a dielectric
slab to only partially fill the distance between the plates, as shown in Figure 7.20b.
The applied voltage remains the same, but the field is no longer uniform between the
plates. There is an air–dielectric boundary. The field is different in the air and dielectric regions. Suppose that the field is E1 in the air region and E2 in the dielectric
region. Both these fields are normal to the boundary by the choice of the dielectric
shape (faces parallel to the plates). As a result of polarization, bound surface charges
+AσP and −AσP appear on the surfaces of the dielectric slab, as shown in Figure 7.20b,
where σP = P, the polarization in the dielectric. We draw a very narrow rectangular
Gauss surface that encompasses the air–dielectric interface and hence the surface
polarization charges −AσP as shown in Figure 7.20c. The field coming in at the left
face in air is E1 (taken as negative) and the field coming out at the right face in the
dielectric is E2. The surface integral En dA and Gauss’s law become

The polarization P and the field E2 in the dielectric are related by
P = εo χe2E2

or
P = εo(εr2 − 1)E2

where χe2 is the electrical susceptibility and εr2 is the relative permittivity of the
inserted dielectric. Then, substituting for P, we can relate E1 and E2,
E1 = E2 + (εr2 − 1)E2

or
E1 = εr2 E2

The field in the air part is E1 and the relative permittivity is 1. The example in
Figure 7.20b involved a boundary between air (vacuum) and a dielectric solid, and
the boundary was parallel to the plates and hence normal to the fields E1 and E2. A
more general expression can be shown to relate the normal components of the electric
field, shown as En1 and En2 in Figure 7.21a, on either side of a boundary by
εr1En1 = εr2En2

[7.39]

There is a second boundary condition that relates the tangential components of
the electric field, shown as Et1 and Et2 in Figure 7.21a, on either side of a boundary.
These tangential fields must be equal.
Et1 = Et2

[7.40]

We can readily appreciate this boundary condition by examining the fields in a
parallel plate capacitor, which has two dielectrics longitudinally filling the space
between the plates but with a boundary parallel to the field, as shown in Figure 7.21b.
The field in each, Et1 and Et2, is parallel to the boundary. The voltage across each

longitudinal dielectric slab is the same, and since E = dV∕dx, the field in each is
the same, Et1 = Et2 = V∕d.
The above boundary conditions are widely used in explaining dielectric behavior
when boundaries are involved. For example, consider a small disk-shaped cavity
within a solid dielectric between two electrodes, as depicted in Figure 7.22. The diskshaped cavity has its face perpendicular to the electric field. Suppose that the dielectric length d is 1 cm and the cavity size is on the scale of micrometers. The average
field within the dielectric will still be close to V∕d because in integrating the field
E(x) to find the voltage across the dielectric, the contribution from a tiny distance
of a few microns will be negligible compared with contributions coming over the
rest of the 1 cm. But the field within the cavity will not be the same as the average
field E1 in the dielectric. If εr1 = 5 for the dielectric medium and the cavity has air,
then at the cavity face we have
εr2E2 = εr1E1

which gives
V
E2 = 5( )
d

Air insulation in a 100 μm (0.1 mm) thick cavity breaks down when E2 is typically
100 kV cm−1. From E2 = 5(V∕d), a voltage of 20 kV will result in the breakdown
of air in the cavity and hence a discharge current. This is called a partial discharge
as only a partial breakdown of the insulation, that in the cavity, has occurred between
the electrodes. Under an ac voltage, the discharge in the cavity can often be sustained
by the capacitive current through the surrounding dielectric. Without this cavity, the
dielectric would accept a greater voltage across it, which in this case is typically
greater than 100 kV.

EXAMPLE 7.9

When the dielectric
fills the whole space between the plates of a capacitor, the net field within the dielectric is
the same as before, E = V∕d. Explain what happens when a dielectric slab of thickness t ≪ d
is inserted in the middle of the space between the plates, as shown in Figure 7.23. What is
the field inside the dielectric?

SOLUTION

The problem is illustrated in Figure 7.23 and has symmetry in that the field in air on either
side of the dielectric is the same and E1. The boundary conditions give
εr1E1 = εr2E2

Further, the integral of the field from one plate to the other must be V because dV∕dx = E.
Examining Figure 7.23, we see that the integration is
E1(d − t) + E2t = V

We now have to eliminate E1 between the previous two equations and obtain E2, which
can be done by algebraic manipulation,
E2 =

If t ≪ d, then this approximates to

and

E1 = ( )

(t ≪ d)

[7.42]

Clearly E1 in the air space remains the same as the applied field V∕d. Since εr1 = 1 (air)
and εr2 > 1, E2 in the thin dielectric slab is smaller than the applied field V∕d. On the other
hand, if we have air space between two dielectric slabs, then the field in this air space will
be greater than the field inside the two dielectric slabs. Indeed, if the applied voltage is
sufficiently large, the field in the air gap can cause dielectric breakdown of this region.
GAUSS’S LAW WITHIN A DIELECTRIC AND FREE CHARGES Gauss’s law in Equation 7.37
contains the total charge Qtotal, enclosed within the surface. Generally, these enclosed charges
are free charges Qfree, due to the free carriers on the electrode, and bound charges QP, due to
polarization charges on the dielectric surface. Apply Gauss’s law using a Gaussian rectangular surface enclosing the left electrode and the dielectric surface in Figure 7.24. Show that
the electric field E in the dielectric can be expressed in terms of free charges only, Qfree, through

SOLUTION

We apply Gauss’s law to a hypothetical rectangular surface enclosing the left electrode and
the dielectric surface. The field E in the dielectric is normal and outwards at the Gauss surface
in Figure 7.24. Thus En = E in the left-hand side of Equation 7.37.
εo AE = Qtotal = Qfree − QP = Qfree − AP = Qfree − Aεo(εr − 1)E

where we have used P = εo(εr − 1)E. Rearranging,
εoεr AE = Qfree

Since AE is effectively the surface integral of En, the above corresponds to writing
Gauss’s law in a dielectric in terms of free charges as
∮Surface

En dA =

Qfree
εoεr

The above equation assumes that polarization P and E are linearly related,
P = εo(εr − 1)E

We note that if we only use free charges in Gauss’s law, then we simply multiply εo by the
dielectric constant of the medium. The above proof is by no means a rigorous derivation.

DIELECTRIC STRENGTH AND
INSULATION BREAKDOWN

7.6.1

DIELECTRIC STRENGTH: DEFINITION

A defining property of a dielectric medium is not only its ability to increase capacitance but also, and equally important, its insulating behavior or low conductivity so
that the charges are not simply conducted from one plate of the capacitor to the other
through the dielectric. Dielectric materials are widely used as insulating media
between conductors at different voltages to prevent the ionization of air and hence
current flashovers between conductors. The voltage across a dielectric material and
hence the field within it cannot, however, be increased without limit. Eventually a

voltage is reached that causes a substantial current to flow between the electrodes,
which appears as a short between the electrodes and leads to what is called dielectric breakdown. In gaseous and many liquid dielectrics, the breakdown does not
generally permanently damage the material. This means that if the voltage causing
breakdown is removed, then the dielectric can again sustain voltages until the voltage
is sufficiently high to cause breakdown again. In solid dielectrics the breakdown
process invariably leads to the formation of a permanent conducting channel and
hence to permanent damage. The dielectric strength Ebr is the maximum field that
can be applied to an insulating medium without causing dielectric breakdown.
Beyond Ebr, dielectric breakdown takes place. The dielectric strength of solids
depends on a number of factors besides simply the molecular structure, such as the
impurities in the material, microstructural defects (e.g., microvoids), sample geometry, nature of the electrodes, temperature, and ambient conditions (e.g., humidity),
as well as the duration and frequency of the applied field. Dielectric strength is
different under dc and ac conditions. There are also aging effects that slowly degrade
the properties of the insulator and reduce the dielectric strength. For engineers
involved in insulation, the dielectric strength of solids is therefore one of the most
difficult parameters to interpret and use. For example, the breakdown field also
depends on the thickness of the insulation because thicker insulators have more
volume and hence a greater probability of containing a microstructural defect (e.g.,
a microcavity) that can initiate a dielectric breakdown. Table 7.5 shows some typical
dielectric strengths for various dielectrics used in electrical insulation. Unpressurized
gases have lower breakdown strengths than liquids and solids.

7.6.2 DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN AND PARTIAL DISCHARGES: GASES
Due to cosmic radiation, there are always a few free electrons in a gas. If the field
is sufficiently large, then one of these electrons can be accelerated to sufficiently
large kinetic energies to impact ionize a neutral gas molecule and produce an additional

free electron and a positively charged gas ion. Both the first and liberated electrons
are now available to accelerate in the field again and further impact ionize more
neutral gas molecules, and so on. Thus, an avalanche of impact ionization processes
creates many free electrons and positive gas ions in the gas, which give rise to a
discharge current between the electrodes. The process is similar to avalanche breakdown in a reverse-biased pn junction. The breakdown in gases depends on the pressure. The concentration of gas molecules is greater at higher pressures. This means
that the mean separation between molecules, and, hence, the mean free path of a
free electron, is shorter. Shorter mean free paths inhibit the free electrons from
accelerating to reach impact ionization energies unless the field is increased. Thus,
generally, Ebr increases with the gas pressure. The 60 Hz breakdown field for an air
gap of 1 cm at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure is about 31.7 kV cm−1.
On the other hand, the gas sulfurhexafluoride, SF6, has a dielectric strength of
79.3 kV cm−1 and an even higher strength when pressurized. SF6 is therefore used
instead of air in high-voltage circuit breakers.
A partial discharge occurs when only a local region of the dielectric is exhibiting discharge, so the discharge does not directly connect the two electrodes. For
example, for the cylindrical conductor carrying a high voltage above a grounded
plate, as in Figure 7.25a, the electric field is greatest on the surface of the conductor facing the ground. This field initiates discharge locally in this region because the
field is sufficiently high to give rise to an electron avalanche effect. Away from the
conductor, however, the field is not sufficiently strong to continue the electron avalanche discharge. This type of local discharge in high field regions is termed corona
discharge. Voids and cracks occurring within solid dielectrics and discontinuities at
the dielectric–electrode interface can also lead to partial discharges as the field in
these voids is higher than the average field in the dielectric, and, further, the dielectric strength in the gas (e.g., atmosphere) in the void is less than that of the continuous solid insulation. Figure 7.25b and c depict two examples of partial discharges
occurring in voids, one inside the solid (perhaps an air or gas bubble introduced
during the processing of the dielectric) and the other (perhaps in the form of a crack)

7. 6

DIELECTRIC STRENGTH AND INSULATION BREAKDOWN

at the solid–electrode interface. In practice, a variety of factors can lead to microvoids and microcavities inside solids as well as at interfaces. Partial discharges in
these voids physically and chemically erode the surrounding dielectric region and
lead to an overall deterioration of the dielectric strength. If uncontrolled, they can
eventually give rise to a major breakdown.

IMPACT IONIZATION IN GASSES AND BREAKDOWN Consider discharge in an argon gas.
Suppose two electrodes are separated by a distance d = 1 mm and the Ar gas pressure P =
1 atm, or 1.01 × 105 Pa. The breakdown voltage Vbr for Ar gas at this pressure and electrode
spacing is about 2.4 kV.11 The field in the gas is very roughly Ebr = Vbr∕d ≈ 2.4 × 106 V m−1.
Let ℓ be the mean free path of an electron parallel to the field from an ionizing collision with
a gas atom A to the next ionizing collision, as shown in Figure 7.26a. The ionization energy
EI of Ar is 15.75 eV. If the projectile electron gains sufficient energy, it can impact ionize A
and release an electron from A, shown as 2 in Figure 7.26b, from the ground state E1 into
vacuum (“vacuum” here means space between the gas atoms). The KE gained from the field,
force × distance, or eEbrℓ must be at least EI, so that
eEbrℓ = EI

or

ℓ = 6.5 × 10−6 m

or

6.5 μm

The concentration of gas atoms ngas can be found from the ideal gas law PV = NkT,
ngas = P∕kT = 2.5 × 1025 m−3. The average separation between the molecules is ngas−1∕3 or
3.4 nm, so that the projectile electron passes by many Ar atoms before an ionizing collision.
If S is the cross-sectional area of the gas atom, then, using the same arguments we did
in Chapter 2, there must at least be one gas atom in the volume ℓS or ℓSngas = 1 and ℓ =
1∕Sngas. Not every collision would lead to ionization. An electron interacting with the periphery of an atom may simply become deflected without causing any impact ionization. Some
collisions may simply excite A to a higher energy rather than ionize it. In some cases, the
projectile electron can even become attached to the gas atom if the atom is strongly electronegative. Thus, the actual cross sectional area Si involved in an impact ionization would be
smaller than S, which means that

Typical periodic table websites and various chemistry books give the radius of an Ar atom
around 70 pm so that ri is indeed less than the full radius, as expected. We neglected the
dependence of Si on the electron energy.
Both the primary (ionizing) and the secondary (ionized) electron can be accelerated by
the field to cause further impact ionizations, which can lead to an avalanche of impact ionization

This is easily found by using the Paschen curve for argon gas. See Question 7.23. The example here is a
simple back-of-an-envelope type estimation of typical processes involved in electrical breakdown in a gas;
there are many rigorous treatises in the literature. Further, the ionization cross-sectional area Si depends on
the electron energy.

processes in which a large number of electrons and gas ions are generated as shown in Figure 7.26c. The ionized atoms can impinge on the cathode and cause a secondary emission of
electrons from this electrode as explained in Chapter 4 and shown in Figure 6.26c. These
secondary electrons can now be accelerated by the field leading to further avalanche of impact
ionization and so on. At sufficiently high fields, there can be a self-sustained breakdown, an
arc, occurring between the electrodes, which constitutes a breakdown.
It is clear that the breakdown voltage Vbr between two electrodes depends on the electrode
separation d as well as the gas pressure P. It has been found that Vbr can be expressed as a
function of pressure × electrode separation only, that is, Vbr = f (Pd), which is called Paschen’s
law. Figure 7.26d shows a typical Vbr versus Pd behavior—a Paschen curve. At high pressures
in region II, Vbr increases with P because ℓ becomes shorter and a higher voltage is needed
to accelerate the electrons to the ionization threshold. At very low pressures in region I, the
mean free path is already very long, the electron can certainly gain much energy from the
field (much more than EI) but there are not many atoms to ionize. As the pressure increases,
Vbr decreases because the electron can find more atoms to ionize.

7.6.3 DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN: LIQUIDS
The processes that lead to the breakdown of insulation in liquids are not as clear as
the electron avalanche effect in gases. In impure liquids with small conductive particles in suspension, it is believed that these impurities coalesce end to end to form
a conducting bridge between the electrodes and thereby give rise to discharge. In
some liquids, the discharge initiates as partial discharges in gas bubbles entrapped
in the liquid. These partial discharges can locally raise the temperature and vaporize
more of the liquid and hence increase the size of the bubble. The eventual discharge
can be a series of partial discharges in entrapped gas bubbles. Moisture absorption
and absorption of gases from the ambient generally deteriorate the dielectric strength.
Oxidation of certain liquids, such as oils, with time produces more acidic and hence
higher conductivity inclusions or regions that eventually give discharge. In some
liquids, the discharge involves the emission of a large number of electrons from the
electrode into the liquid due to field emission at high fields. This is a discharge
process by electrode injection.

7. 6

DIELECTRIC STRENGTH AND INSULATION BREAKDOWN

7.6.4 DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN: SOLIDS
There are various major mechanisms that can lead to dielectric breakdown in solids.
The most likely mechanism depends on the dielectric material’s condition and
sometimes on extrinsic factors such as the ambient conditions, moisture absorption
being a typical example.

Intrinsic Breakdown or Electronic Breakdown The most common type of

electronic breakdown is an electron avalanche breakdown. A free electron in the
conduction band (CB) of a dielectric in the presence of a large field can be accelerated to sufficiently large energies to collide with and ionize a host atom of the
solid. The electron gains an energy eEbr ℓ when it moves a distance ℓ under an
applied field Ebr. If this energy is greater than the bandgap energy Eg, then the
electron, as a result of a collision with the lattice vibrations, can excite an electron
from the valence band to the conduction band, that is, “break” a bond. Both the
primary and the released electron can further impact ionize other host atoms and
thereby generate an electron avalanche effect that leads to a substantial current. The
initial conduction electrons for the avalanche are either present in the CB or are
injected from the metal into the CB as a result of field-assisted thermal emission
from the Fermi energy in the metal to the CB in the dielectric. Taking typical values, Eg ≈ 5 eV and ℓ to be of the order of the mean free path for lattice scattering,
say ∼50 nm, one finds Ebr ≈ 1 MV cm−1. Obviously, Ebr depends on the choice of ℓ,
but its order of magnitude indicates voltages that are quite large. This type of
breakdown represents an upper theoretical limit that is probably approached by only
certain dielectrics—those that have practically no defects. Usually, microstructural
defects lead to a lower dielectric strength than the limit indicated by intrinsic breakdown. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) films with practically no structural defects in present
MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) capacitors (as in the gates of MOSFETs) probably
exhibit an intrinsic breakdown.
If dielectric breakdown does not occur by an electron avalanche effect (perhaps
due to short mean free paths in the insulator), then another insulation breakdown
mechanism is the enormous increase in the injection of electrons from the metal
electrode into the insulator at very high fields as a result of field-assisted emission.12
It has been proposed that insulation breakdown under short durations in some thin
polymer films is due to this type of tunneling injection.

Thermal Breakdown Finite conductivity of the insulation means that there is
Joule heat σE2 being released within the solid. Further, at high frequencies, the
dielectric loss, V 2ω tan δ, becomes especially significant. For example, the work
done by the external field in rotating the dipoles is transferred more frequently to
random molecular collisions as heat as the frequency of the field increases. Both
conduction and dielectric losses therefore generate heat within the dielectric. If this
heat cannot be removed from the solid sufficiently quickly by thermal conduction
12
The emission of electrons by tunneling from an electrode in the presence of a large field was treated in
Chapter 4 as Fowler–Nordheim field emission.

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

(or by other means), then the temperature of the dielectric will increase. The increase
in the temperature invariably increases the conductivity of an insulator. The increase
in the conductivity then leads to more Joule heating and hence further rises in the
temperature and so on. If the heat cannot be conducted away to limit the temperature,
then the result is a thermal runaway condition in which the temperature and the
current increase until a discharge occurs through various sections of the solid. As a
consequence of sample inhomogeneities, frequently thermal runaway is severe in
certain parts of the solid that become hot spots and suffer local melting and physical
and chemical erosion. Hot spots are those local regions or inhomogeneities where σ
or ε″r is larger or where the thermal conductivity is too poor to remove the heat
generated. Local breakdown at various hot spots eventually leads to a conducting
channel connecting the opposite electrodes and hence to a dielectric breakdown.
Since it takes time to raise the temperature of the dielectric, due to the heat capacity,
this breakdown process has a marked thermal lag. The time to achieve thermal
breakdown depends on the heat generated, and hence on E 2. Conversely, this means
that the dielectric strength Ebr depends on the duration of application of the field.
For example, at 70 °C, pyrex has an Ebr of typically 9 MV cm−1 if the applied field
duration is kept short, not more than 1 ms or so. If the field is kept for 30 s, then
the breakdown field is only 2.5 MV cm−1. Dielectric breakdown in various ceramics
and glasses at high frequencies has been attributed directly to thermal breakdown.
A characteristic feature of thermal breakdown is not only the thermal lag, the time
dependence, but also the temperature dependence. Thermal breakdown is facilitated
by increasing the temperature of the dielectric, which means that Ebr decreases with
temperature.

Electromechanical Breakdown and Electrofracture A dielectric medium
between oppositely charged electrodes experiences compressional forces because the
opposite charges +Q and −Q on the plates attract each other, as depicted in Figure 7.27.
As the voltage increases, so does the compressive load, and the dielectric becomes
squeezed, or the thickness d gets smaller. At each stage, the increase in the compressive load is normally balanced by the elastic deformation of the insulation to a new
smaller thickness. However, if the elastic modulus is sufficiently small, then compressive loads cannot be simply balanced by the elasticity of the solid, and there is
a mechanical runaway for the following reasons. The decrease in d, due to the compressive load, leads to a higher field (E = V∕d) and also to more charges on the

electrodes (Q = CV, C = εoεr A∕d). This in turn leads to a greater compressive load,
which further decreases d, and so on, until the shear stresses within the insulation
cause the insulation to flow plastically (for example, by viscous deformation). Eventually, the insulation breaks down. In addition, the increase in E as d gets smaller
results in more Joule (σE 2) and dielectric-loss heating (ωE 2 tan δ) in the dielectric,
which increases the temperature and hence lowers the elastic modulus and viscosity,
thereby further deteriorating the mechanical stability. It is also possible for the field
during the mechanical deformation of the dielectric to reach the thermal breakdown
field, in which case the dielectric failure is not truly a mechanical breakdown mechanism though initiated by mechanical deformations. Another possibility is the initiation and growth of internal cracks (perhaps filamentary cracks) by internal stresses
around inhomogeneous regions inside the dielectric. For example, an imperfection
or a tiny cavity experiences shear stresses and also large local electric fields. Combined effects of both large shear stresses and large electric fields eventually lead to
crack propagation and mechanical and, hence, dielectric failure. This type of process
is sometimes called electrofracture. It is generally believed that certain thermoplastic polymers suffer from electromechanical dielectric breakdown, especially close to
their softening temperatures. Polyethylene and polyisobutylene have been cited as
examples.

Internal Discharges These are partial discharges that take place in microstructural voids, cracks, or pores within the dielectric where the gas atmosphere (usually
air) has lower dielectric strength. A porous ceramic, for example, would experience
partial discharges if the applied field is sufficiently large. The discharge current in
a void, such as those in Figure 7.25b and c, can be easily sustained under ac conditions, which accounts for the severity of this type of breakdown mechanism under
ac conditions. Initially, the pore size (or the number of pores) may be small and the
partial discharge insignificant, but with time the partial discharge erodes the internal
surfaces of the void. Partial discharges can locally melt the insulator and can easily
cause chemical transformations. Eventually, and usually, an electrical tree type of
discharge develops from a partial discharge that has been eroding the dielectric, as

depicted in Figure 7.28a for a high-voltage cable in which there is a tiny void at the
interface between the dielectric and the inner conductor (generated perhaps by the
differential thermal expansion of the electrode and polymeric insulation). The erosion
of the dielectric by the partial discharge propagates like a branching tree. The “tree
branches” are erosion channels—hollow filaments of various sizes—in which gaseous discharge takes place and forms a conducting channel during operation. Two
sets of examples are shown in the photos on page 705 where one can identify socalled branch trees and bush trees. Open tree-like partial discharge structures are
often called branch trees. A bush tree develops when there is a compact and high
concentration of partial discharge channels emerging from the breakdown point such
that the region resembles the structure of a “bush.” Bush trees typically occur at
higher breakdown fields than branch trees. Both grow with time and eventually cause
a breakdown. (Examine the center and bottom photos on page 705.)
In the case of a coaxial high-voltage cable in Figure 7.28a, the dielectric is usually a polymer, cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) being one of the most popular.
The electric field is maximum at the surface of the inner conductor, which is the
reason for the initiation of most electrical trees near this surface. Electrical treeing
is substantially controlled by having semiconductive polymer layers or sheaths surrounding the inner conductor and the outer surface of the insulator, as shown in
Figure 7.28b. For flexibility, the inner conductor is frequently multicored, or stranded,
rather than solid. Due to the extrusion process used to draw the insulation, the semiconductive polymer sheaths are bonded to the insulation. There are therefore practically no microvoids at the interfaces between the insulator and the semiconducting
sheath. Further, these semiconducting polymer sheaths are sufficiently conductive to
become “part of the electrodes.” Both the conductor and the adjacent semiconductor
are roughly at the same voltage, which means that there is no breakdown in the
semiconductor–conductor interfaces. There is normally an outer jacket (e.g., PVC)
to protect the cable.

Insulation Aging It is well recognized that during service, the properties of an

insulating material become degraded and eventually dielectric breakdown occurs at
a field below that predicted by experiments on fresh forms of the insulation. Aging
is a term used to describe, in a general sense, the deterioration in the properties of
the insulation. Aging therefore determines the useful life of the insulation. There are
many factors that either directly or indirectly affect the properties and performance
of an insulator in service. Even in the absence of an electric field, the insulation will
experience physical and chemical aging whereby its physical and chemical properties
change considerably. An insulation that is subjected to temperature and mechanical
stress variations can develop structural defects, such as microcracks, which are quite
damaging to the dielectric strength, as mentioned above. Irradiation by ionizing
radiation such as X-rays, exposure to severe ambient conditions such as excessive
humidity, ozone, and many other external conditions, through various chemical processes, deteriorate the chemical structure and properties of an insulator. This is generally much more severe for polymers than ceramics, but it is not practical to use a
solid ceramic insulation in a coaxial power cable. Oxidation of a polymeric insulation
with time is another form of chemical aging and is well-known to degrade the insulation performance. This is the reason for adding various antioxidants into semicrystalline polymers for use in insulation. The chemical aging processes are generally
accelerated with temperature. In service, the insulation also experiences electrical
aging as a result of the effects of the field on the properties of the insulation. For
example, dc fields can disassociate and transport various ions in the structure and
thereby slowly change the structure and properties of the insulation. Electrical trees
develop as a result of electrical aging because, in service, the ac field gives rise to
continual partial discharges in an internal or surface microcavity, which then erodes

7. 6

DIELECTRIC STRENGTH AND INSULATION BREAKDOWN

707

the region around it and slowly grows like a branching tree. In well-manufactured
insulation systems, electrical treeing has been substantially reduced or eliminated
from microvoids. A form of electrical aging that is currently of concern is water
treeing, which eventually leads to electrical treeing. The definition of a water tree,
as viewed under an optical microscope, is a diffused bushy (or broccoli) type growth
that consists of millions of microscopic voids (per mm3) containing water or aqueous
electrolyte. They invariably occur in moist environments and are relatively nonconducting, which means that they do not themselves directly lead to a discharge. However, they can eventually lead to an electric tree type breakdown inasmuch as they
effectively reduce the quality of the insulation. (See photos on page 706.)

External Discharges There are many examples where the surface of the insula-

tion becomes contaminated by ambient conditions such as excessive moisture, deposition of pollutants, dirt, dust, and salt spraying. Eventually the contaminated surface
develops sufficient conductance to allow discharge between the electrodes at a field
below the normal breakdown strength of the insulator. This type of dielectric breakdown over the surface of the insulation is termed surface tracking.
It is apparent that there are a number of dielectric breakdown mechanisms and
the one that causes eventual breakdown depends not only on the properties and quality of the material but also on the operating conditions, environmental factors being
no less important. Figure 7.29 provides an illustrative diagram showing the relationship between the breakdown field and the time to breakdown. An insulation that can
withstand large fields for a very short duration will break down at a lower field if
the duration of the field increases. The breakdown mechanism is also likely to change
from being intrinsic to being, perhaps, thermal. When insulation breakdown occurs

in times beyond a few days, it is generally attributed to the degradation of the insulation, which eventually leads to a breakdown through, most probably, electrical
treeing. It is also apparent that it is not possible to clearly identify a specific dielectric
breakdown mechanism for a given material.

Consider two candidate materials for the dielectric insulation: cross-linked polyethylene
(XLPE) and silicone rubber. Suppose that the inner conductor diameter is 5 mm and the
insulation thickness is also 5 mm. What is the voltage that will cause dielectric breakdown in each insulator?
What typical voltage will initiate a partial discharge in a small air pore (perhaps formed
during mechanical and thermal stressing) at the inner conductor–insulator interface?
Assume that the breakdown field for air at 1 atm and gap spacing around 0.1 mm is
about 100 kV cm−1.

SOLUTION

Consider a cylindrical shell of thickness dr of the dielectric as shown in Figure 7.30. Suppose
that the voltage across the shell thickness is dV. Then the field E at r is −dV∕dr (this is the
definition of E). Suppose that Qfree is the free charge on the inner conductor. We take a Gauss
surface that is a cylinder of radius r and concentric with the inner conductor as depicted in
Figure 7.30. The surface area A of this cylinder is 2πrL where L is the length of the cable.
The field at the surface, at distance r, is E, which is normal to A and coming out of A. Then

The voltages for partial discharges for the two coaxial cables are shown in the sixth
column of Table 7.6. It should be noted that these voltages will only give partial discharges
contained within microvoids and will not normally lead to the immediate breakdown of the
insulation. The partial discharges erode the cavities and also release vapor from the polymer
that accumulates in the cavities. Thus, gaseous content and pressure in a cavity will change
as the partial discharge continues. For example, the pressure buildup will increase the breakdown field and elevate the voltage for partial breakdown. Eventual degradation is likely to
lead to electrical treeing.
We should also note that the actual field in the air cavity depends on the shape of the
cavity, and the above treatment is only valid for a thin disk-like cavity lying perpendicular to
the field (see Section 7.9, Additional Topics).

CAPACITOR DIELECTRIC MATERIALS

7.7.1

TYPICAL CAPACITOR CONSTRUCTIONS

The selection criteria of dielectric materials for capacitors depend on the capacitance
value, frequency of application, maximum tolerable loss, and maximum working
voltage, with size and cost being additional external constraints. Requirements for
high-voltage power capacitors are distinctly different than those used in small integrated circuits. Large capacitance values are more easily obtained at low frequencies
because low-frequency polarization mechanisms such as interfacial and dipolar
polarization make a substantial contribution to the dielectric constant. At high frequencies, it becomes more difficult to achieve large capacitances and at the same
time maintain acceptable low dielectric loss, inasmuch as the dielectric loss per unit
volume is εoε′r ωE 2 tan δ.
The bar-chart diagrams in Figures 7.31 and 7.32 provide some typical examples
of dielectrics for a range of capacitance values and for a range of usable frequencies.
For example, electrolytic dielectrics characteristically provide capacitances between

below 10 kHz. On the other hand, polymeric film capacitors typically have values
less than 10 μF but a frequency response that is flat well into the gigahertz range.
We can understand the principles utilized in capacitor design from the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor,
C=

εoεr A
d

[7.51]

where εr infers ε′r. Large capacitances can be achieved by using high εr dielectrics,
thin dielectrics, and large areas. There are various commercial ceramics, usually a
mixture of various oxides or ferroelectric ceramics, that have high dielectric constants, ranging up to several thousands. These are typically called high-K (or high-κ),
where K (or κ) stands for the relative permittivity. A ceramic dielectric with εr = 10,
d of perhaps 10 μm, and an area of 1 cm2 has a capacitance of 885 pF. Figure 7.33a
shows a typical single-layer ceramic capacitor. The thin ceramic disk or plate has
suitable metal electrodes, and the whole structure has been encapsulated in an epoxy
by dipping it in a thermosetting resin. The epoxy coating prevents moisture from
degrading the dielectric properties of the ceramic (increasing ε″r and the loss, tan δ).
One way to increase the capacitance is to connect N number of these in parallel, and

capacitor as in (b).
As the two separate metal films are lined at opposite edges, electroding is done over the
whole side surface.

this is done in a space-efficient way by using the multilayer ceramic structure shown
in Figure 7.33b. In this case there are N electroded dielectric layers. Each ceramic
has offset metal electrodes that align with the opposite sides of the plate and make
contact with the metal terminations on these sides. The result is N number of parallel plate capacitors. There is therefore an effective use of volume as the surface area
of the component stays the same but the height increases to at least Nd. By using
multilayer ceramic structures, capacitances up to a few hundred microfarads have
been recently obtained.
Many wide-frequency-range capacitors utilize polymeric thin films for two reasons. Although εr is typically 2–3 (less than those for many ceramics), it is constant
over a wide frequency range. The dielectric loss εoεr ωE 2 tan δ becomes significant
at high frequencies and polymers have low tan δ values. Low εr values mean that
one has to find a space-efficient way of constructing polymer film capacitors. One
method is shown in Figure 7.34a and b for constructing a metallized film polymer
capacitor. Two polymeric tapes have metallized electrodes (typically vacuum deposited Al) on one surface, leaving a margin on one side. These metal film electrodes
have been offset in opposite directions so that they line up with the opposite sides
of the tapes. The two tapes together are rolled up (like a Swiss-roll cake) and the
opposite sides are electroded using suitable conducting glues or other means. The
concept is therefore similar to the multilayer ceramic capacitor except that the layers
are rolled up to form a circular cross section. It is also possible to cut and stack the
layers as in the multilayer ceramic construction.
Electrolytic capacitors provide large values of capacitance while maintaining a
tolerable size. There are various types of electrolytic capacitors. In aluminum electrolytic capacitors, the metal electrodes are two Al foils, typically 50–100 μm thick,
that are separated by a porous paper medium soaked with a liquid electrolyte. The
two foils together are wound into a cylindrical form and held within a cylindrical
case, as shown in Figure 7.35a. Contrary to intuition, the paper-soaked electrolyte is
not the dielectric. The dielectric medium is the thin alumina Al2O3 layer grown on
the roughened surface of one of the foils, as shown in Figure 7.35b. This foil is then
called the anode (+ terminal). Both Al foils are etched to obtain rough surfaces,
which increases the surface area compared with smooth surfaces. The capacitor is

called electrolytic because the Al2O3 layer is grown electrolytically on one of the
foils and is typically 0.1 μm in thickness. This small thickness and the large surface
area are responsible for the large capacitance. The electrolyte is conducting and
serves to heal local minor breakdowns in the Al2O3 by an electrolytic reaction, provided that the anode has been positively biased. The capacitive behavior is due to
the Al/(Al2O3)/electrolyte structure. Furthermore, Al/Al2O3 contact is like a metal to
p-type semiconductor contact and has rectifying properties. It must be reverse-biased
to prevent charge injection into the Al2O3 and hence conduction through the capacitor. Thus the Al must be connected to the positive terminal, which makes it the
anode. When the electrolytic Al capacitor in Figure 7.35b is oppositely biased, it
becomes conducting.
Electrolytic capacitors using liquid electrolytes tend to dry up over a long period,
which is a disadvantage. Solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors overcome the dryingup problem by using a solid electrolyte. The structure of a typical solid Ta capacitor
is shown in Figure 7.36a and b. The anode (+ electrode) is a porous (sintered) Ta
pellet that has the surface anodized to obtain a thin surface layer of tantalum pentoxide, Ta2O5, which is the dielectric medium (with ε′r = 28). The Ta pellet with

Ta2O5 is then coated with a thick solid electrolyte, in this case MnO2. Subsequently,
graphite and silver paste layers are applied. Leads are then attached and the whole
construction is molded into a resin chip. Solid tantalum capacitors are widely used
in numerous electronics applications due to their small size, temperature and time
stability, and high reliability.
Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are capacitors with large capacitance values
that can be as high as 100 F or more; but with low breakdown voltages, typically a
few volts. They store much more energy than conventional electrolytic capacitors per
unit volume and essentially function almost like a rechargeable battery for storing
and providing energy for various electrical applications. Their principle depends on
two factors: increasing the area A and decreasing the thickness d in the capacitance
equation C = εr εo A∕d to reach higher capacitance values. In one type of supercapacitor technology, called the electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC), the electrodes are powdered carbon (or a similar porous conducting medium), which are
separated by an ion-permeable separator soaked in an electrolyte in which there are
mobile positive and negative ions. The electrolyte could be an aqueous solution with
H+ and SO−4 ions, for example. Under an applied voltage, each electrode becomes
polarized as in Figure 7.37, somewhat similar to the interfacial polarization at the
negative electrode in Figure 7.11b, giving rise to a capacitance at each electrode;
shown as C1 and C1 in Figure 7.37. There is no actual transfer of charge at the
interface but only a separation between charges; that is polarization. One can appreciate that a small separation d between negative and positive charges at the carbon–
electrolyte interface can be very small, and less than a nanometer in practice. The
powdered carbon increases the effective surface area A. Thus, the capacitance at each
electrode becomes very large. These capacitances at the electrodes are in series,
connected by the ions in the electrolyte forming a bridge. While supercapacitors
serve as convenient rechargeable energy sources, their capacitive performance in
terms of frequency response and internal resistance is very limited.

It is clear that large capacitances require high dielectric constants and thin dielectrics. We should note that d appears as d 2, so the importance of d cannot be understated. Although mica has a higher εr than polymer films, the latter can be made
quite thin, a few microns, which leads to a greater capacitance per unit volume. The
reason that electrolytic aluminum capacitors can achieve large capacitance per unit
volume is that d can be made very thin over a large surface area by using the liquid
electrolyte to heal minor local dielectric breakdowns. Table 7.7 shows a selection of
dielectric materials for capacitor applications and compares the “volume efficiency”
Cvol based on a typical minimum thickness that a convenient process can handle. It
is apparent that, compared with polymeric films, ceramics have substantial volume
efficiency as a result of large dielectric constants (high-K ceramics) in some cases
and as a consequence of a thin dielectric thickness in other cases (Al2O3). A proper
account of volume efficiency must also include the volume associated with the anode

and cathode electrodes and the electrolyte. For example, these additional volumes
will substantially reduce Cvol listed for Al2O3 and for Ta2O5 in Table 7.7; Cvol for
these two will still be greater than the other dielectrics.
Another engineering consideration in selecting a dielectric is the working voltage. Although d can be decreased to obtain large capacitances per unit volume, this
also decreases the working voltage. The maximum voltage that can be applied to a
capacitor depends on the breakdown field of the dielectric medium Ebr, which itself
is a highly variable quantity. A safe working voltage must be some safety factor η
less than the breakdown voltage Ebrd. Thus, if Vm is the maximum safe working
voltage, then the maximum energy that can be stored per unit volume is given by

It is clear that both ε′r and Ebr of the dielectric are significant in determining the
energy storage ability of the capacitor. Moreover, at the maximum working voltage,
the rate of dielectric loss per unit volume in the capacitor becomes

ωεoε′r tan δ

[7.54]

Those materials that have relatively higher tan δ exhibit greater dielectric losses.
Although dielectric losses may be small at low frequencies, at high frequencies they
become quite significant. Table 7.7 compares the energy storage efficiency Evol and
tan δ for various dielectrics. It seems that ceramics have a better energy storage
efficiency than polymers. High-K ceramics tend to have large tan δ values and suffer from greater dielectric loss. Polypropylene has particularly low tan δ as the polarization mechanism is due to electronic polarization and the dielectric loss is among
the least. Indeed, polypropylene capacitors have found applications in high-quality
audio electronics. Polystyrene has similar characteristics to polypropylene but the
latter is more widely used. Equations 7.53 and 7.54 should be used with care, because
the breakdown field Ebr can depend on the thickness d, among many other factors,
including the quality of the dielectric material. For example, for polypropylene insulation, Ebr is typically quoted as roughly 50 kV mm−1 (500 kV cm−1), whereas for
thin films (e.g., 25 μm), over short durations, Ebr can be as high as 200 kV mm−1.
Further, in some cases, Ebr is more suitably defined in terms of the maximum allowable leakage current, that is, a field at which the dielectric is sufficiently conducting.
The temperature stability of a capacitor is determined by the temperature dependences of ε′r and tan δ, which are controlled by the dominant polarization mechanism.
For example, polar polymers have permanent dipole groups attached to the polymer
chains as in polyethyleneterephthalate (PET). In the absence of an applied field, these
dipoles are randomly oriented and also restricted in their rotations by neighboring
chains, as depicted in Figure 7.38a. In the presence of an applied dc field, as in
Figure 7.38b, some very limited rotation enables partial dipolar (orientational) polarization to take place. Typically, at room temperature, dipolar contribution to εr under
ac conditions, however, is small because restricted and hindered rotation prevents
the dipoles to closely follow the ac field. Close to the softening temperature of the

polymer, the molecular motions become easier and, further, there is more volume
between chains for the dipoles to rotate. The dipolar side groups and polarized chains
become capable of responding to the field. They can align with the field and also
follow the field variations, as shown in Figure 7.38c. Dipolar contribution to εr is
substantial even at high frequencies. Both ε′r and tan δ therefore increase with temperature. Thus, polar polymers exhibit temperature dependent εr and tan δ, which
reflect in the properties of the capacitor.
On the other hand, in nonpolar polymers such as polypropylene, the polarization
is due to electronic polarization and εr and tan δ remain relatively constant. Thus
polypropylene capacitors are more stable compared with PET (polyester) capacitors.
The change in the capacitance with temperature is measured by the temperature
coefficient of capacitance (TCC), which is defined as the fractional (or percentage)
change in the capacitance per unit temperature change. The temperature controls not
only εr but also the linear expansion of the dielectric, which changes the dimensions
A and d. For example, polystyrene, polycarbonate, and mica capacitors are particularly stable with small TCC values. Plastic capacitors are typically limited to operations well below their melting temperatures, which is one of their main drawbacks.
The specified operating temperature, for example, from −55 °C to 125 °C, for many
of the ceramic capacitors is often a limitation of the epoxy coating of the capacitor
rather than the actual limitation of the ceramic material. In many capacitors, the
working voltage has to be derated for operation at high temperatures and high frequencies because Ebr decreases with ambient temperature and the frequency of the
applied field. For example, a 1000 V dc polypropylene capacitor will have a substantially lower ac working voltage, e.g., 100 V at 10 kHz.

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

DIELECTRIC LOSS AND EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT OF A POLYESTER CAPACITOR AT 1 kHz Figure 7.39 shows the temperature dependence of ε′r and tan δ for a polyester film. Calculate the
equivalent circuit at 30 °C at 1 kHz for a 560 pF PET capacitor that uses a 0.5 μm thick
polyester film. What happens to these values at 100 °C?
SOLUTION

From Figure 7.39 at 30 °C, ε′r = 2.60 and tan δ ≈ 0.002. The capacitance C at 30 °C is
given as 560 pF. The equivalent parallel conductance GP, representing the dielectric loss, is
given by
GP =

ωAεoε′r tan δ
= ωC tan δ
d

Substituting
ω = 2πf = 2000π

and tan δ = 0.002, we get
GP = (2000π) (560 × 10−12 ) (0.002) = 7.04 × 10−9

Ω

This is equivalent to a resistance of 142 MΩ. The equivalent circuit is an ideal (lossless)
capacitor of 560 pF in parallel with a 142 MΩ resistance (this resistance value decreases with
the frequency).
At 100 °C, ε′r = 2.68 and tan δ ≈ 0.01, so the new capacitance is
C100 °C = C25 °C

This is equivalent to a resistance of 27.5 MΩ. The equivalent circuit is an ideal (lossless)

PIEZOELECTRICITY, FERROELECTRICITY,
AND PYROELECTRICITY

7.8.1 PIEZOELECTRICITY
Certain crystals, for example, quartz (crystalline SiO2) and BaTiO3, become polarized when they are mechanically stressed. Charges appear on the surfaces of the
crystal, as depicted in Figure 7.40a and b. Appearance of surface charges leads to
a voltage difference between the two surfaces of the crystal. The same crystals
also exhibit mechanical strain or distortion when they experience an electric field,
as shown in Figure 7.40c and d. The direction of mechanical deformation (e.g.,
extension or compression) depends on the direction of the applied field, or the
polarity of the applied voltage. The two effects are complementary and define
piezoelectricity.13
Only certain crystals can exhibit piezoelectricity because the phenomenon
requires a special crystal structure—that which has no center of symmetry. Consider
a NaCl-type cubic unit cell in Figure 7.41a. We can describe the whole crystal
behavior by examining the properties of the unit cell. This unit cell has a center of
symmetry at O because if we draw a vector from O to any charge and then draw
the reverse vector, we will find the same type of charge. Indeed, any point on any
charge is a center of symmetry. Many similar cubic crystals (not all) possess a center of symmetry. When unstressed, the center of mass of the negative charges at the
corners of the unit cell coincides with the positive charge at the center, as shown in
Figure 7.41a. There is therefore no net polarization in the unit cell and P = 0. Under
stress, the unit cell becomes strained, as shown in Figure 7.41b, but the center of
mass of the negative charges still coincides with the positive charge and the net
polarization is still zero. Thus, the strained crystal still has P = 0. This result is
generally true for all crystals that have a center of symmetry. The centers of mass
of negative and positive charges in the unit cell remain coincident when the crystal
is strained.

mass for positive and negative ions are shifted, which results in a net dipole moment, P, along y. (c) When the
force is along a different direction, along x, there may not be a resulting net dipole moment in that direction
though there may be a net P along a different direction (y).

Piezoelectric crystals have no center of symmetry. For example, the hexagonal
unit cell shown in Figure 7.42a exhibits no center of symmetry. If we draw a vector
from point O to any charge and then reverse the vector, we will find an opposite
charge. The unit cell is said to be noncentrosymmetric. When unstressed, as shown
in Figure 7.42a, the center of mass of the negative charges coincides with the center
of mass of the positive charges, both at O. However, when the unit cell is stressed,
as shown in Figure 7.42b, the positive charge at A and the negative charge at B both
become displaced inwards to A′ and B′, respectively. The two centers of mass therefore become shifted and there is now a net polarization P. Thus, an applied stress
produces a net polarization P in the unit cell, and in this case P appears to be in the
same direction as the applied stress, along y.
The direction of the induced polarization depends on the direction of the applied
stress. When the same unit cell in Figure 7.42a is stressed along x, as illustrated in
Figure 7.42c, there is no induced dipole moment along this direction because there
is no net displacement of the centers of mass in the x direction. However, the stress
causes the atoms A and B to be displaced outwards to A″ and B″, respectively, and

this results in the shift of the centers of mass away from each other along y. In this
case, an applied stress along x results in an induced polarization along y. Generally,
an applied stress in one direction can give rise to induced polarization in other crystal directions. Suppose that Tj is the applied mechanical stress along some j direction
and Pi is the induced polarization along some i direction; then the two are linearly
related by
Pi = dijTj

[7.55]

where dij are called the piezoelectric coefficients. Reversing the stress reverses the
polarization. Although we did not specifically consider shear stresses in Figure 7.42,
they, as well as tensile stresses, can also induce a net polarization, which means
that T in Equation 7.55 can also represent shear stresses. The converse piezoelectric
effect is that between an induced strain Sj along j and an applied electric field Ei
along i,
Sj = dij Ei

[7.56]

The coefficients dij in Equations 7.55 and 7.56 are the same.14
As apparent from the foregoing discussions and Figure 7.40, piezoelectric crystals are essentially electromechanical transducers because they convert an electrical
signal, an electric field, to a mechanical signal, strain, and vice versa. They are used
in many engineering applications that involve electromechanical conversions, as in
ultrasonic transducers, microphones, accelerometers, and so forth. Piezoelectric
transducers are widely used to generate ultrasonic waves in solids and also to detect
such mechanical waves, as illustrated in Figure 7.43. The transducer is simply a
piezoelectric crystal, for example, quartz, that is appropriately cut and electroded to
generate the desired types of mechanical vibrations (e.g., longitudinal or transverse
vibrations). The transducer on the left is attached to the surface A of the solid under

examination, as shown in Figure 7.43. It is excited from an ac source, which means
that it mechanically vibrates. These vibrations are coupled to the solid by a proper
coupling medium (typically grease) and generate mechanical waves or elastic waves
that propagate away from A. They are called ultrasonic waves as their frequencies
are typically above the audible range. When the waves reach the other end, B, they
mechanically vibrate the transducer attached to B, which converts the vibrations to
an electrical signal that can readily be displayed on an oscilloscope. In this trivial
example, one can easily measure the time it takes for elastic waves to travel in the
solid from A to B and hence determine the ultrasonic velocity of the waves since
the distance AB is known. From the ultrasonic velocity one can determine the elastic constants (Young’s modulus) of the solid. Furthermore, if there are internal
imperfections such as cracks in the solid, then they reflect or scatter the ultrasonic
waves. These reflections can lead to echoes that can be detected by suitably located
transducers. Such ultrasonic testing methods are widely used for nondestructive
evaluations of solids in mechanical engineering.
It is clear that an important engineering factor in the use of piezoelectric transducers is the electromechanical coupling between electrical and mechanical energies.

x is determined by the extent of the solid solution but typically is around 0.5. PZT
piezoelectric components are manufactured by sintering, which is a characteristic
ceramic manufacturing process in which PZT powders are placed in a mold and
subjected to a pressure at high temperatures. During sintering the ceramic powders
are fused through interdiffusion. The final properties depend not only on the composition of the solid solution but also on the manufacturing process, which controls
the average grain size or polycrystallinity. Electrodes are deposited onto the final
ceramic component, which is then poled by the application of a temporary electric
field to induce it to become piezoelectric. Poling refers to the application of a temporary electric field, generally at an elevated temperature, to align the polarizations
of various grains and thereby develop piezoelectric behavior.
PIEZOELECTRIC SPARK GENERATOR The piezoelectric spark generator, as used in various

applications such as lighters and car ignitions, operates by stressing a piezoelectric crystal to
generate a high voltage which is discharged through a spark gap in air as schematically shown in
Figure 7.44a. Consider a piezoelectric sample in the form of a cylinder as in Figure 7.44a. Suppose
that the piezoelectric coefficient d = 250 × 10−12 m V−1 and εr = 1000. The piezoelectric cylinder has a length of 10 mm and a diameter of 3 mm. The spark gap is in air and has a breakdown
voltage of about 3.5 kV. What is the force required to spark the gap? Is this a realistic force?

This force can be applied by squeezing by hand an appropriate lever arrangement; it
is the weight of 9 kg. The force must be applied quickly because the piezoelectric charge
generated will leak away (or become neutralized) if the charge is generated too slowly;
many spark igniters use mechanical impact. The energy in the spark depends on the amount
of charge generated. This can increase by using two piezoelectric crystals back to back as
in Figure 7.44b, which is a more practical arrangement for a spark generator. The induced
voltage per unit force V∕F is proportional to d∕(εoεr) which is called the piezoelectric
voltage coefficient. In general, if an applied stress T = F∕A induces a field E = V∕L in a
piezoelectric crystal, then the effect is related to the cause by the piezoelectric voltage
coefficient g,

7.8.2 PIEZOELECTRICITY: QUARTZ OSCILLATORS AND FILTERS
One of the most important applications of the piezoelectric quartz crystal in electronics is in the frequency control of oscillators and filters. Consider a suitably cut
thin plate of a quartz crystal that has thin gold electrodes on the opposite faces.
Suppose that we set up mechanical vibrations in the crystal by connecting the electrodes to an ac source, as in Figure 7.45a. It is possible to set up a mechanical
resonance, or mechanical standing waves, in the crystal if the wavelength λ of the

where n is an integer.
The frequency of these mechanical vibrations fs is given by fs = v∕λ, where v
is the velocity of the waves in the medium and λ is the wavelength. These mechanical vibrations in quartz experience very small losses and therefore have a highquality factor Q, which means that resonance can only be set up if the frequency of
the excitation, the electrical frequency, is close to fs. Because of the coupling of
energy between the electrical excitation and mechanical vibrations through the piezoelectric effect, mechanical vibrations appear like a series LCR circuit to the ac source,
as shown in Figure 7.45b. This LCR series circuit has an impedance that is minimum
at the mechanical resonant frequency fs, given by

In this series LCR circuit, L represents the mass of the transducer, C the stiffness,
and R the losses or mechanical damping. Since the quartz crystal has electrodes at
opposite faces, there is, in addition, the parallel plate capacitance Co between the electrodes. Thus, the whole equivalent circuit is Co in parallel with LCR, as in Figure 7.45b.
As far as L is concerned, Co and C are in series. There is a second higher resonant
frequency fa, called the antiresonant frequency, that is due to L resonating with C

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

The impedance between the terminals of the quartz crystal has the frequency
dependence shown in Figure 7.45c. The two frequencies fs and fa are called the series
and parallel resonant frequencies, respectively. It is apparent that around fa, the crystal behaves like a filter with a high Q value. If we were to examine the reactance of
the crystal, whether it is behaving capacitively or inductively, we would find the
behavior in Figure 7.45d, where positive reactance refers to an inductive and negative
reactance to a capacitive behavior. Between fs and fa the crystal behaves inductively,
and capacitively outside this range. Indeed, between fs and fa the response of the
transducer is controlled by the mass of the crystal. This property has been utilized
by electrical engineers in designing quartz oscillators.
In quartz oscillators, the crystal is invariably used in one of two modes. First,
it can be used at fs where it behaves as a resistance of R without any reactance. The
circuit is designed so that oscillations can take place only when the crystal in the
circuit exhibits no reactance or phase change—in other words, at fs. Outside this
frequency, the crystal introduces reactance or phase changes that do not lead to
sustained oscillations. In a different mode of operation, the oscillator circuit is
designed to make use of the inductance of the crystal just above fs. Oscillations are
maintained close to fs because even very large changes in the inductance result in
small changes in the frequency between fs and fa.

Thus, fa − fs is only 5 kHz. The two frequencies fs and fa in Figure 7.45d are very close.
An oscillator designed to oscillate at fs, that is, at 1 MHz, therefore, cannot drift far (for
example, a few kHz) because that would change the reactance enormously, which would upset
the oscillation conditions.

7.8.3 FERROELECTRIC AND PYROELECTRIC CRYSTALS
Certain crystals are permanently polarized even in the absence of an applied field.
The crystal already possesses a finite polarization vector due to the separation of
positive and negative charges in the crystal. These crystals are called ferroelectric.15

Figure 7.46 BaTiO3 has different crystal structures above and below 130 °C that lead to different dielectric properties.

Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is probably the best cited example. Above approximately
130 °C, the crystal structure of BaTiO3 has a cubic unit cell, as shown in Figure 7.46a.
The centers of mass of the negative charges (O2−) and the positive charges, Ba2+ and
Ti4+, coincide at the Ti4+ ion, as shown in Figure 7.46b. There is therefore no net
polarization and P = 0. Above 130 °C, therefore, the barium titanate crystal exhibits no permanent polarization and is not ferroelectric. However, below 130 °C, the
structure of barium titanate is tetragonal, as shown in Figure 7.46c, in which the
Ti4+ atom is not located at the center of mass of the negative charges. The crystal
is therefore polarized by the separation of the centers of mass of the negative and
positive charges. The crystal possesses a finite polarization vector P and is ferroelectric. The critical temperature above which ferroelectric property is lost, in this
case 130 °C, is called the Curie temperature (TC). Below the Curie temperature,
the whole crystal becomes spontaneously polarized. The onset of spontaneous polarization is accompanied by the distortion of the crystal structure, as shown by the
change from Figure 7.46b to 7.46c. The spontaneous displacement of the Ti4+ ion
below the Curie temperature elongates the cubic structure, which becomes tetragonal.
It is important to emphasize that we have only described an observation and not the
reasons for the spontaneous polarization of the whole crystal. The development of
the permanent dipole moment below the Curie temperature involves long-range interactions between the ions outside the simple unit cell pictured in Figure 7.46c. The
energy of the crystal is lower when the Ti4+ ion in each unit cell is slightly displaced
along the c direction, as in Figure 7.46c, which generates a dipole moment in each
unit cell. The interaction energy of these dipoles when all are aligned in the same
direction lowers the energy of the whole crystal. It should be mentioned that the
distortion of the crystal that takes place when spontaneous polarization occurs just
below TC is very small relative to the dimensions of the unit cell. For BaTiO3, for
example, c∕a is 1.01 and the displacement of the Ti4+ ion from the center is only
0.012 nm, compared with a = 0.4 nm.
An important and technologically useful characteristic of a ferroelectric crystal
is its ability to be poled. Above 130 °C there is no permanent polarization in the
crystal. If we apply a temporary field E and let the crystal cool to below 130 °C,
we can induce the spontaneous polarization P to develop along the field direction.

In other words, we would define the c axis by imposing a temporary external field.
This process is called poling. The c axis is the polar axis along which P develops. It
is also called the ferroelectric axis. Since below the Curie temperature the ferroelectric crystal already has a permanent polarization, it is not possible to use the expression
P = εo(εr − 1)E

to define a relative permittivity. Suppose that we use a ferroelectric crystal as a dielectric medium between two parallel plates. Since any change ΔP normal to the plates
changes the stored charge, what is of significance to the observer is the change in the
polarization. We can appreciate this by noting that C = Q∕V is not a good definition
of capacitance if there are already charges on the plates, even in the absence of voltage.16
We then prefer a definition of C based on ΔQ∕ΔV where ΔQ is the change in stored
charge due to a change ΔV in the voltage. Similarly, we define the relative permittivity
εr in this case in terms of the change ΔP in P induced by ΔE in the field E,
ΔP = εo(εr − 1)ΔE

An applied field along the a axis can displace the Ti4+ ion more easily than that
along the c axis, and experiments show that εr ≈ 4100 along a is much greater than
εr ≈ 160 along c. Because of their large dielectric constants, ferroelectric ceramics
are used as high-K dielectrics in capacitors.
All ferroelectric crystals are also piezoelectric, but the reverse is not true: not
all piezoelectric crystals are ferroelectric. When a stress along y is applied to the
BaTiO3 crystal in Figure 7.47a, the crystal is stretched along y, as a result of which
the Ti4+ atom becomes displaced, as shown in Figure 7.47b. There is, however, no
shift in the center of mass of the negative charges, which means that there is a change
ΔP in the polarization vector along y. Thus, the applied stress induces a change in
the polarization, which is a piezoelectric effect. If the stress is along x, as illustrated
16
A finite Q on the plates of a capacitor when V = 0 implies an infinite capacitance, C = ∞. However, C = dQ∕dV
definition avoids this infinity.

in Figure 7.47c, then the change in the polarization is along y. In both cases, ΔP is
proportional to the stress, which is a characteristic of the piezoelectric effect.
The barium titanate crystal in Figure 7.46 is also said to be pyroelectric
because when the temperature increases, the crystal expands and the relative distances of ions change. The Ti4+ ion becomes shifted, which results in a change in
the polarization. Thus, a temperature change δT induces a change δP in the polarization of the crystal. This is called pyroelectricity, which is illustrated in Figure 7.48.
The magnitude of this effect is quantized by the pyroelectric coefficient p, which
is defined by

A few typical pyroelectric crystals and their pyroelectric coefficients are listed
in Table 7.9. Very small temperature changes, even in thousandths of degrees, in
the material can develop voltages that can be readily measured. For example, for a
PZT-type pyroelectric ceramic in Table 7.9, taking δT = 10−3 K and p ≈ 380 × 10−6,
we find δP = 3.8 × 10−7 C m−2. From
δP = εo(εr − 1) δE

with εr = 290, we find

δE = 148 V m−1

Radiation is absorbed in the detecting element, A, which generates a pyroelectric voltage that is measured
by the amplifier. The second element, B, has a reflecting electrode and does not absorb the radiation. It
is a dummy element that compensates for the piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric effects generate equal
voltages in both A and B, which cancel each other across a and b, the input of the amplifier.

which can be readily measured. Pyroelectric crystals are widely used as infrared
detectors. Any infrared radiation that can raise the temperature of the crystal even
by a thousandth of a degree can be detected. For example, many intruder alarms use
pyroelectric detectors because as the human or animal intruder passes by the view
of detector, the infrared radiation from the warm body raises the temperature of the
pyroelectric detector, which generates a voltage that actuates an alarm.
Figure 7.49 shows a simplified schematic circuit for a pyroelectric radiation
detector. The detecting element, labeled A, is actually a thin crystal or ceramic (or
even a polymer) of a pyroelectric material that has electrodes on opposite faces.
Pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric and therefore also sensitive to stresses.
Thus, pressure fluctuations, for example, vibrations from the detector mount or sound
waves, interfere with the response of the detector to radiation alone. These can be
compensated for by having a second dummy detector B that has a reflecting coating
and is subjected to the same vibrations (air and mount), as depicted in Figure 7.49.
Thus, there are two elements in the detector, one with an absorbing surface, detecting element A, and the other with a reflecting surface, compensating element B.
Stress fluctuations give rise to the same piezoelectric voltage in both, which then
cancel each other between a and b at the input of the amplifier. When radiation is
incident, then only the detecting element absorbs the radiation, becomes warmer, and
hence generates a pyroelectric voltage. This voltage appears directly across a and b.
As the incident radiation warms the detecting element and increases its temperature,
the pyroelectric voltage increases with time. Eventually the temperature reaches a
steady-state value determined by heat losses from the element. We therefore expect
the pyroelectric voltage to reach a constant value as well. However, the problem is
that a constant pyroelectric voltage cannot be sustained because the surface charges
slowly become neutralized or leak. The constant radiation is therefore normally

chopped to subject the detector to periodic bursts of radiation, as shown in Figure 7.49.
The pyroelectric voltage is then a changing function of time, which is readily measured and related to the power in the incident radiation.
Many pyroelectric applications refer to a pyroelectric current that is generated
by the temperature rise. There is another way to look at the pyroelectric phenomenon
instead of considering the induced pyroelectric voltage that is created across the
crystal (Figure 7.48). The induced polarization δP in a small time interval δt, due
to the change δT in the temperature, generates an induced polarization charge density
δP on the crystal’s surfaces. This charge density δP flows in a time interval δt, and
hence generates an induced polarization current density Jp to flow, i.e.,

Jp in Equation 7.63 is called the pyroelectric current density and depends on the

defined as the pyroelectric current generated per unit input radiation power,

where I is the radiation intensity (W m−2); ℛI is quoted in A W−1. If the pyroelectric
current generated by the crystal flows into the self-capacitance of the crystal itself
(no external resistors or capacitors connected, and the voltmeter is an ideal meter),
it charges the self-capacitance to generate the observed voltage δV in Figure 7.48.
The pyroelectric voltage responsivity ℛV is defined similarly to Equation 7.64 but
considers the voltage that is developed upon receiving the input radiation:

ℛV =

The output voltage that is generated depends not only on the pyroelectric crystal’s dielectric properties, but also on the input impedance of the amplifier, and can
be quite complicated. A typical commercial LiTaO3 pyroelectric detector has a current responsivity of 0.1–1 μA∕W.

EXAMPLE 7.17

A PYROELECTRIC RADIATION DETECTOR

Consider the radiation detector in Figure 7.49
but with a single element A. Suppose that the radiation is chopped so that the radiation
is passed to the detector for a time Δt seconds every τ seconds, where Δt ≪ τ. If Δt is
sufficiently small, then the temperature rise ΔT is small and hence the heat losses are
negligible during Δt. Using the heat capacity to find the temperature change during Δt,
relate the magnitude of the voltage ΔV to the incident radiation intensity I. What is your
conclusion?
Consider a PZT-type pyroelectric material with a density of about 7 g cm−3 and a specific
heat capacity of about 380 J K−1 kg−1. If Δt = 0.2 s and the minimum voltage that can be
detected above the background noise is 1 mV, what is the minimum radiation intensity that
can be measured?

SOLUTION

Suppose that the radiation of intensity I is received during a time interval Δt and delivers an
amount of energy ΔH to the pyroelectric detector. This energy ΔH, in the absence of any
heat losses, increases the temperature by ΔT. If c is the specific heat capacity (heat capacity
per unit mass) and ρ is the density,
ΔH = (ALρ)c ΔT

where A is the surface area and L the thickness of the detector. The change in the polarization ΔP is
ΔP = p ΔT =

The change in the surface charge ΔQ is

The parameters in the parentheses are material properties and reflect the “goodness” of the

we did not consider any heat losses that will prevent the rise of the temperature indefinitely. If
Δt is short, then the temperature change will be small and heat losses negligible.

We have assumed that all the incident radiation I is absorbed by the pyroelectric crystal. In
practice, only a fraction η (called the emissivity of the surface), that is, ηI, will be absorbed
instead of I. We also assumed that the output voltage ΔV is developed totally across the
pyroelectric element capacitance; that is, the amplifier’s input impedance (parallel combination of its input capacitance and resistance) is negligible (i.e., infinite) compared with that of
the pyroelectric crystal. As stated, we also neglected all heat losses from the pyroelectric
crystal so that the absorbed radiation simply increases the crystal’s temperature. These simplifying assumptions lead to the maximum signal ΔV that can be generated from a given
input radiation signal I as stated in Equation 7.66. It is left as an exercise to show that Equation 7.66 can also be easily derived by starting from Equation 7.63 for the pyroelectric current
density Jp, and have Jp charge up the capacitance C = εoεr A∕L of the crystal.

An ideal electrometer (with no leakage current) measures the total charge on the
positive plate (or voltage of the positive plate with respect to the negative plate).
The voltage across the plates is Vo and the capacitance is Co. The field in the free

When we insert a dielectric to fit between the plates, the field polarizes the

of the dielectric, as shown in Figure 7.50b. As there is no battery to supply more
free charges, the net charge on the left plate (positive plate) becomes Qfree − QP.
Similarly the net negative charge on the right plate becomes −Qfree + QP. The field
inside the dielectric is no longer Eo but less because induced polarization charges
have the opposite polarity to the original free charges and the net charge on each
plate has been reduced. The new field can be found by applying Gauss’s law. Consider a Gauss surface just enclosing the left plate and the surface region of the

For uniform polarization, the charge distribution is QP∕A, as we have used previously. Since σP = P, where P is the polarization vector, we can write
P=

and therefore express QP as
QP =

∮Surface

P dA

[7.69]

We can now substitute for QP in Equation 7.68 and take this term to the left-hand
side to add the two surface integrals. The right-hand side is left with only Qfree. Thus,
∮Surface

(εoE + P) dA = Qfree

[7.70]

What is important here is that the surface integration of the quantity εoE + P is
always equal to the total free charges on the surface. Whatever the dielectric material, this integral is always Qfree. It becomes convenient to define εoE + P as a usable
quantity, called the electric displacement and denoted as D, that is,
D = εoE + P

[7.71]

Then, Gauss’s law in terms of free charges alone in Equation 7.70 becomes
∮Surface

D dA = Qfree

[7.72]

In Equation 7.72 we take D to be normal to the surface area dA as in the case
of E in Gauss’s law. Equation 7.72 provides a convenient way to calculate the electric
displacement D, from which one should be able to determine the field. We should
note that, in general, E is a vector and so is P, so the definition in Equation 7.71 is
strictly in terms of vectors. Inasmuch as the electric displacement depends only on

Substituting for P in Equation 7.71 and rearranging, we find that D is simply
given by
D = εoεr E

[7.73]

We should note that this simple equation applies in an isotropic medium where
the field along one direction, for example, x, does not generate polarization along a
different direction, for example, y. In those cases, Equation 7.73 takes a tensor form
whose mathematics is beyond the scope of this book.
We can now apply Equation 7.72 for a Gauss surface surrounding the left plate,
D=

Qfree
= εoEo
A

[7.74]

where we used Equation 7.67 to replace Qfree. Thus D does not change when we
insert the dielectric because the same free charges are still on the plates (they cannot
be conducted away anywhere). The new field E between the plates after the insertion
of the dielectric is
E=

D = Eo

[7.75]

The original field is reduced by the polarization of the dielectric. We should
recall that the field does not change in the case where the parallel plate capacitor is
connected to a battery that keeps the voltage constant across the plates and supplies
additional free charges (ΔQfree) to make up for the induced opposite-polarity polarization charges.
Gauss’s law in Equation 7.72 in terms of D and the enclosed free charges Qfree
can also be written in terms of the field E, but including the relative permittivity,
because D and E are related by Equation 7.73. Using Equation 7.73, Equation 7.72

Figure 7.52 The field inside the dielectric can be considered
to be the sum of the field due to the free charges (Qfree) and
a field due to the polarization of the dielectric, called the
depolarization field.

The Depolarizing Field We can view the field E as arising from two electric
fields: that due to the free charges Eo and that due to the polarization charges,
denoted as Edep. These two fields are indicated in Figure 7.52. Eo is called the applied
field as it is due to the free charges that have been put on the plates. It starts and
ends at free charges on the plates. The field due to polarization charges starts and
ends at these bound charges and is in the opposite direction to the Eo. Although Eo
polarizes the molecules of the medium, Edep, being in the opposite direction, tries to
depolarize the medium. It is called the depolarizing field (and hence the subscript).
Thus the field inside the medium is
E = Eo − Edep

[7.77]

The depolarizing field depends on the amount of polarization since it is determined by +QP and −QP. For the dielectric plate in Figure 7.52, we know the field
E is Eo∕εr, so we can eliminate Eo in Equation 7.77 and relate Edep directly to E,
Edep = E(εr − 1)

However, the polarization P is related to the field E by
P = εo(εr − 1)E

which means that the depolarization field is
1
Edep = P
εo

[7.78]

As we expected, the depolarizing field is proportional to the polarization P. We
should emphasize that Edep is in the opposite direction to E and P and Equation 7.78
is for magnitudes only. If we write it as a vector equation, then we must introduce
a negative sign to give Edep a direction opposite to that of P. Moreover, the relationship in Equation 7.78 is special to the dielectric plate geometry in Figure 7.52.
In general, the depolarizing field is still proportional to the polarization, as in Equation 7.78, but it is given by
Edep =

[7.79]

where Ndep is a numerical factor called the depolarization factor. It takes into

as we found in Equation 7.78. For the spherical dielectric medium as in Figure 7.53a,
Ndep = 31 . For a long thin dielectric rod placed with its axis along the applied field,
as in Figure 7.53b, Ndep ≈ 0 and becomes exactly zero as the diameter shrinks to
zero. Ndep is always between 0 and 1. If we know Ndep, we can determine the field
inside the dielectric, for example, in a small spherical cavity within an insulation given
the external field.

7.10

LOCAL FIELD AND THE LORENTZ EQUATION

When a dielectric medium is placed in an electric field, it becomes polarized and
there is a macroscopic, or an average, field E in the medium. The actual field at an
atom, called the local field Eloc, however, is not the same as the average field as
illustrated in Figure 7.7.
Consider a dielectric plate polarized by placing it between the plates of a capacitor as shown in Figure 7.54a. The macroscopic field E in the dielectric is given by
the applied field Eo due to the free charges Qfree on the plates, and the depolarization
field due to P, or polarization charges on the dielectric plate surfaces A. Since we

field E is determined by the

E = Eo − Edep = Eo −

1
P
εo

Consider the field at some atomic site, point O, but with the atom itself removed.
We evaluate the field at O coming from all the charges except the atom at O itself
since we are looking at the field experienced by this atom (the atom cannot become
polarized by its own field). We then cut a (hypothetical) spherical cavity S centered
at O and consider the atomic polarizations individually within the spherical cavity.
In other words, the effects of the dipoles in the cavity are treated separately from
the remaining dielectric medium which is now left with a spherical cavity. This
remaining dielectric is considered as a continuous medium but with a spherical cavity. Its dielectric property is represented by its polarization vector P. Because of the
cavity, we must now put polarization charges on the inner surface S of this cavity
as illustrated in Figure 7.54b. This may seem surprising, but we should remember
that we are treating the effects of the atomic dipoles within the cavity individually
and separately by cutting out a spherical cavity from the medium and thereby introducing a surface S.
The field at O comes from four sources:
1. Free charges Qfree on the electrodes, represented by Eo.
2. Polarization charges on the plate surfaces A, represented by Edep.
3. Polarization charges on the inner surface of the spherical cavity S, represented
by ES.
4. Individual dipoles within the cavity, represented by Edipoles.
Thus,
Eloc = Eo + Edep + ES + Edipoles

Since the first two terms make up the macroscopic field, we can write this as
Local field in
a crystal

Eloc = E + ES + Edipoles

The field from the individual dipoles surrounding O depends on the positions
of these atomic dipoles which depend on the crystal structure. For cubic crystals,
amorphous solids (e.g., glasses), or liquids, effects of these dipoles around O cancel
each other and Edipoles = 0. Thus,
Eloc = E + ES

[7.80]

We are then left with evaluating the field due to polarization charges on the
inner surface S of the cavity. This field comes from polarization charges on the
surface S. Consider a thin spherical shell on surface S as shown in Figure 7.55 which
makes an angle θ with O. The radius of this shell is a sin θ, whereas its width (or
thickness) is a dθ. The surface area dS is then (2πa sin θ)(a dθ). The polarization
charge dQP on this spherical shell surface is Pn dS where Pn is the polarization vector
normal to the surface dS. Thus,
dQP = Pn dS = (P cos θ)(2πa sin θ)(a dθ)

be quite complicated.

DIPOLAR POLARIZATION

Consider a gaseous medium with molecules that have permanent dipole moments as
in Figure 7.10b. Each permanent dipole moment is po. In the presence of an electric
field the dipoles try to align perfectly with the field, but random thermal collisions,
17

The derivation is somewhat oversimplified. Remember that the charge dQP on the shell dS would need to be
found by integrating tiny elements of charge on the this shell. Each of these tiny elements contributes to the field
and each generates a tiny field at an angle cos θ. Integrating all these over dS gives the result dQP∕(4πεoa2) cos θ.

i.e., thermal agitation, act against this perfect alignment as in Figure 7.10b. A molecule that manages to rotate and align with the field finds itself later colliding with
another molecule and losing its alignment. We are interested in the mean dipole
moment in the presence of an applied field taking into account the thermal energies
of the molecules and their random collisions. We will assume that the probability
that a molecule has an energy E is given by the Boltzmann factor, exp(−E∕kT ).
Consider an arbitrary dipolar molecule in an electric field as in Figure 7.56 with
its dipole moment po at an angle θ with the field E. The torque experienced by the
dipole is given by τ = (F sin θ)a or Epo sin θ where po = aQ. The potential energy

Inasmuch as the PE depends on the orientation θ, there is a certain probability
of finding a dipole oriented at this angle as determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The fraction f of molecules oriented at θ is proportional to exp(−E∕kT ),
f ∝ exp(

poE cos θ
kT )

[7.83]

The initial orientation of the dipole should be considered in three dimensions
and not as in the two-dimensional illustration in Figure 7.56. In three dimensions
we use solid angles, and the fraction f then represents the fraction of molecules
pointing in a direction defined by a small solid angle dΩ as shown in Figure 7.57.
The whole sphere around the dipole corresponds to a solid angle of 4π. Furthermore,
we need to find the average dipole moment along E as this will be the induced net
dipole moment by the field. The dipole moment along E is po cos θ. Then from the
definition of the average
pav =

∫04π (po cos θ) f dΩ
∫04π f dΩ

[7.84]

where f is the Boltzmann factor given in Equation 7.83 and depends on E and θ.
The final result of the above integration is a special function called the Langevin

The behavior of the Langevin function is shown in Figure 7.58. At the highest
fields L(x) tends toward saturation at unity. Then, pav = po, which corresponds to
nearly all the dipoles aligning with the field, so increasing the field cannot increase
pav anymore. In the low field region, pav increases linearly with the field. In practice,
the applied fields are such that all dipolar polarizations fall into this linear behavior
region where the Langevin function L(x) ≈ 13 x. Then Equation 7.85 becomes

IONIC POLARIZATION AND
DIELECTRIC RESONANCE

In ionic polarization, as shown in Figure 7.9, the applied field displaces the positive
and negative ions in opposite directions, which results in a net dipole moment per
ion, called the induced dipole moment pi per ion. We can calculate the ionic polarizability αi and the ionic contribution to the relative permittivity as a function of
frequency by applying an ac field of the form E = Eo exp( jωt).
Consider two oppositely charged neighboring ions, e.g., Na+ and Cl−, which
experience forces QE in opposite directions where Q is the magnitude of the ionic
charge of each ion as shown in Figure 7.59. The bond between the ions becomes

stretched, and the two ions become displaced from the equilibrium separation ro to
a new separation ro + x as depicted in Figure 7.59. The force F = QE of the applied
field is the polarizing force, which causes the relative displacement. We take F to
be along the x direction. The applied force is resisted by a restoring force Fr that
is due to the stretching of the bond (Hooke’s law) and is proportional to the amount
of bond stretching, i.e., Fr = −βx where β is the spring constant associated with
the ionic bond (easily calculated from the potential energy curve of the bond), and
the negative sign ensures that Fr is directed in the opposite direction to the applied
force. Thus, the net force acting on the ions is QE − βx. As the ions are oscillated
by the applied force, they couple some of the energy in the applied field to lattice
vibrations and this energy is then lost as heat (lattice vibrations) in the crystal. As
in classical mechanics, this type of energy loss through a coupling mechanism can
be represented as a frictional force (force associated with losses) Floss that acts
against the effect of the applied force. This frictional force is proportional to the
velocity of the ions or dx∕dt, so it is written as Floss = −γ(dx∕dt) where γ is a proportionality constant that depends on the exact mechanism for the energy loss from
the field, and the negative sign ensures that it is opposing the applied field. The total
(net) force on the ions is
Ftotal = F + Fr + Floss = QE − βx − γ

dx
dt

Normally we would examine the equations of motion (Newton’s second law)
under forced oscillation for each ion separately, and then we would use the results
to find the overall extension x. An equivalent procedure (as well known in mechanics) is to keep one ion stationary and allow the other one to oscillate with a reduced
mass Mr, which is Mr = (M+M−)∕(M+ + M−) where M+ and M− are the masses of
Na+ and Cl− ions, respectively. For example, we can simply examine the oscillations
of the Na+ -ion within the reference frame of the Cl− -ion (kept “stationary”) and
attach a reduced mass Mr to Na+ as depicted in Figure 7.59. Then Newton’s second

It is convenient to put Mr and β together into a new constant ωI which represents

Equation 7.89 is a second-order differential equation for the induced displacement x of a pair of neighboring ions about the equilibrium separation as a result of
an applied force QE. It is called the forced oscillator equation and is well known in
mechanics. (The same equation would describe the damped motion of a ball attached
to a spring in a viscous medium and oscillated by an applied force.) The solution to
Equation 7.89 will give the displacement x = xo exp( jωt), which will have the same
time dependence as E but phase shifted; that is, xo will be a complex number. The
relative displacement of the ions from the equilibrium gives rise to a net or induced
polarization pi = Qx. Thus Equation 7.89 can be multiplied by Q to represent the
forced oscillations of the induced dipole. Equation 7.89 is also called the Lorentz
dipole oscillator model.
The induced dipole pi will also be phase shifted with respect to the applied force
QE. When we divide pi by the applied field E, we get the ionic polarizability αi,
given by
αi =

It can be seen that the polarizability is also a complex number as we expect;
there is a phase shift between E and induced pi. It therefore has real α′i and imaginary α″i parts and can be written as αi = α′i − jα″i . We note that, by convention,
the imaginary part is written with a minus sign to keep α″i as a positive quantity.
Further, when ω = 0, under dc conditions, the ionic polarizability αi(0) from Equation 7.90 is

The dependences of the real and imaginary parts of αi on the frequency of the
field are shown in Figure 7.60 in terms of the normalized frequency (ω∕ωI) for one
particular value of the loss factor, γI = 0.1ωI. Note that α″i peaks at a frequency very
close to the ionic bond resonant frequency ωI (it is exactly ωI when γI = 0). The
sharpness and magnitude of the α″i peak depends on the loss factor γI. The peak is
sharper and higher for smaller γI. Notice that α′i is nearly constant at frequencies
lower than ωI. Indeed, in a dc field, α′i = αi(0). But, through ωI, α′i shows a rapid
change from positive to negative values and then it tends toward zero for frequencies
greater than ωI.
Zero or negative α′i should not be disconcerting since the actual magnitude of
the polarizability is ∣αi∣ = (α′i 2 + α″i 2 ) 1∕2 , which is always positive through ωI and
maximum at ωI. The phase of αi however changes through ωI. The phase of αi, and
hence the phase of the polarization with respect to the field, are zero at low frequencies (ω ≪ ωI). As the frequency increases, the polarization lags behind the field and
the phase of αi becomes more negative. At ω = ωI, the polarization lags behind the
field by 90°. However, the rate of change of polarization is in phase with the field
oscillations, which leads to a maximum energy transfer. At high frequencies, well
above ωI, the ions cannot respond to the rapidly changing field and the coupling
between the field and the ions is negligible. The peak in the α″i versus ω behavior
around ω = ωI is what is called the dielectric resonance peak, and in this particular case it is called the ionic polarization relaxation peak and is due to the strong
coupling of the applied field with the natural vibrations of the ionic bond at ω = ωI.
The resulting relative permittivity εr can be found from the Clausius–Mossotti
equation. But we also have to consider the electronic polarizability αe of the
two types of ions since this type of polarization operates up to optical frequencies
(ω ≫ ωI), which means that

where Ni is the concentrations of negative and positive ion pairs (assuming an equal
number of positive and negative ions), and αe+ and αe− are the electronic polarizabilities of the negative and positive ion species, respectively. Inasmuch as αi is a
complex quantity, so is the relative permittivity εr(ω). We can express Equation 7.93
differently by noting that at very high frequencies, ω ≫ ωI, αi = 0, and the relative
permittivity is then denoted as εrop. Equation 7.93 then becomes

This is called the dielectric dispersion relation between the relative permittivity, due to ionic polarization, and the frequency of the electric field. Figure 7.16b
shows the behavior of εr(ω) with frequency for KCl where ε″r peaks at ω = ωI =
2π(4.5 × 1012) rad s−1 and ε′r exhibits sharp changes around this frequency. It is clear
that as ω gets close to ωI, there are rapid changes in εr(ω). The resonant frequency
(ωI) for ionic polarization relaxation is typically in the infrared frequency range, and
the “applied” field in the crystal is then due to a propagating electromagnetic (EM)
wave rather than an ac applied field between two external electrodes placed on the
crystal.18
It should be mentioned that electronic polarization can also be described by the
Lorentz oscillator model, and can also be represented by Equation 7.92 if we appropriately replace αi by αe and interpret ωI and γI as the resonant frequency and loss
factor involved in electronic polarization.

IONIC POLARIZATION RESONANCE IN KCl Consider a KCl crystal which has the FCC
crystal structure and the following properties. The optical dielectric constant is 2.19, the dc
dielectric constant is 4.84, and the lattice parameter a is 0.629 nm. Calculate the dc ionic
polarizability αi(0). Estimate the ionic resonance absorption frequency and compare the value
with the experimentally observed resonance at 4.5 × 1012 Hz in Figure 7.16b. The atomic
masses of K and Cl are 39.09 and 35.45 g mol−1, respectively.
SOLUTION

At optical frequencies the dielectric constant εrop is determined by electronic polarization. At
low frequencies and under dc conditions, the dielectric constant εrdc is determined by both
electronic and ionic polarization. If Ni is the concentration of negative and positive ion pairs,

This is about a factor of 1.5 greater than the observed resonance absorption frequency
of 4.5 × 1012 Hz. Typically one accounts for the difference by noting that the actual ionic
charges may not be exactly +e on K+ and −e on Cl−, but Q is effectively 0.76e. Taking
Q = 0.76e makes fI = 5.15 × 1012 Hz, only 14 percent greater than the observed value.
A closer agreement can be obtained by refining the simple theory and considering how many
effective dipoles there are in the unit cell along the direction of the applied field.

DIELECTRIC MIXTURES AND
HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA

Many dielectrics are composite materials; that is, they are mixtures of two or more
different types of dielectric materials with different relative permittivities and loss
factors. The simplest example is a porous dielectric which has small air pores randomly dispersed within the bulk of the material as shown in Figure 7.61a (analogous to a random raisin pudding). Another example would be a dielectric material
composed of two distinctly different phases that are randomly mixed, as shown in
Figure 7.61b, somewhat like a Swiss cheese that has air bubbles. We often need to
find the overall or the effective dielectric constant εreff of the mixture, which is
not a trivial problem.19 This overall εreff can then be used to treat the mixture as if
it were one dielectric substance with this particular dielectric constant; for example,

19
The theories that try to represent a heterogeneous medium in terms of effective quantities are called
effective medium theories (or approximations). The theory of finding an effective dielectric constant of a mixture
has intrigued many famous scientists in the past. Over the years, many quite complicated mixture rules have
been developed, and there is no shortage of formulas in this field. Many engineers however still tend to use
simple empirical rules to model a composite dielectric. The primary reason is that many theoretical mixture rules
depend on the exact knowledge of the geometrical shapes, sizes, and distributions of the mixed phases.

the capacitance can be calculated from C = εoεreff A∕d by simply using εreff. It should
be emphasized that if mixing occurs at the atomic level so that the material is
essentially a solid solution, then, in principle, the Clausius–Mossotti equation can
be used in which we simply add the polarizabilities of each species of atoms or
ions weighted by their concentration. (We did this for CsCl in Example 7.4.) The
present problem examines heterogeneous materials, and hence excludes such solid
solutions.
The theoretical treatment of mixtures can be quite complicated since one has to
consider not only individual dielectric properties but also the geometrical shapes,
sizes, and distributions of the two (or more) phases present in the composite material. In many cases, empirical rules that have been shown to work have been used
to predict εreff. Consider a heterogeneous dielectric that has two mixed phases I and
II with dielectric constants εr1 and εr2, and volume fractions v1 and v2, respectively,
(v1 + v2 = 1) as in Figure 7.61b. One simple and useful mixture rule is
Generalized
mixture rule

Lichtenecker
formula

εnreff = v1εnr1 + v2εnr2

[7.95]

where n is an index (a constant), usually determined empirically, that depends on
the type of mixture. If we have a stack of plates of I and II in alternating (or in
random) sequence between the two electrodes as in Figure 7.61c, this would be like
many series-connected dielectrics and n would be −1. If the phases are in parallel
as plates of I and II stacked on top of each other, as shown in Figure 7.61d, then n
is 1. As n approaches 0, Equation 7.95 can be shown to be equivalent to a logarithmic
mixture rule:
ln εreff = v1 ln εr1 + v2 ln εr2

[7.96]

which is known as the Lichtenecker formula (1926). Although its scientific basis
is not strong, it has shown remarkable applicability to various heterogeneous media;
perhaps due to the fact that it is a kind of compromise between the two extreme
limits of series and parallel mixtures.

7 .1 3

DIELECTRIC MIXTURES AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA

749

There is one particular mixture rule for dispersed dielectric spheres (with εr1),
such as air pores, in a continuous dielectric matrix (with εr2), that works quite
well for volume fractions up to about 20 percent, called the Maxwell–Garnett
formula
εreff − εr2
εr1 − εr2
= v1
εreff + 2εr2
εr1 + 2εr2

[7.97]

The Maxwell–Garnett equation can predict the effective dielectric constant of
many different types of dielectrics that have dispersed pores. There are other mixture
rules,20 but the above are some of the common types. In addition, we need to consider the shape of the dispersed particle; remember that the depolarization field
depends on the shape of the dielectric. For example, Equation 7.97 can be modified
further to include a shape factor as well.

It was mentioned in Chapter 2
that today’s high transistor density ICs have multilayers of metal interconnect lines that are
separated by an interlayer dielectric (ILD). The speed of the chip (as limited by the RC time
constant) depends on the overall interconnect capacitance, which depends on the relative
permittivity εrILD of the ILD. The traditional ILD material has been SiO2 with εr = 3.9. There
is much research interest in finding suitable low-κ materials for such ILD applications, especially in ultralarge-scale integration (ULSI). Estimate the required porosity in SiO2 if its
effective relative permittivity is to be 2.5? What would be the porosity needed if we start
with a dielectric that has εr = 3.0?
LOW-κ POROUS DIELECTRICS FOR MICROELECTRONICS

SOLUTION

The Maxwell–Garnett equation is particularly useful for such porous media calculations. Substituting εr2 = 3.9, εr1 = 1 (air pores), and setting εreff = 2.5 in Equation 7.97 we have
2.5 − 3.9
1 − 3.9
= v1
2.5 + 2(3.9)
1 + 2(3.9)

and solving gives
v1 = 0.412,

or

41% porosity

Such porosity is achievable but it may have side effects such as poorer mechanical properties
and lower breakdown voltage. (We should take the calculated porosity as an estimate since
the volume fraction is higher than typical limits for Equation 7.97.) Note that the Lichtenecker
formula gives 32.6 percent porosity. As apparent from this example, there is a distinct
advantage in starting with a dielectric that has a low initial εr, and then using porosity to
lower εr further. For example, if we start with εr2 = 3.0, and repeat the calculation above
for εreff = 2.5, then we would find v1 = 0.21 or 21 percent porosity. Many polymeric materials have εr values around 2.5 and have been candidate materials for low-κ ILD applications
in microelectronics. (The above ideas are explored further in Questions 7.35 and 7.36.)

Another popular mixture rule is the Bruggeman rule, given by Equation 7.102 in Question 7.35.

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

DEFINING TERMS
Boundary conditions relate the normal and tangential components of the electric field next to the boundary. The tangential component must be continuous
through the boundary. Suppose that En1 is the normal
component of the field in medium 1 at the boundary
and εr1 is the relative permittivity in medium 1. Using
a similar notation for medium 2, then the boundary
condition is εr1En1 = εr2En2.
Clausius–Mossotti equation relates the dielectric
constant (εr), a macroscopic property, to the polarizability (α), a microscopic property.
Complex relative permittivity (ε′r − jε″r ) has a real
part (ε′r) that determines the charge storage ability and
an imaginary part (ε″r ) that determines the energy
losses in the material as a result of the polarization
mechanism. The real part determines the capacitance
through C = εoε′r A∕d and the imaginary part determines the electric power dissipation per unit volume as
heat by E 2ωεoε″r .
Corona discharge is a local discharge in a gaseous
atmosphere where the field is sufficiently high to
cause dielectric breakdown, for example, by avalanche
ionization.
Curie temperature TC is the temperature above
which ferroelectricity disappears, that is, the spontaneous polarization of the crystal is lost.
Debye equations attempt to describe the frequency
response of the complex relative permittivity ε′r − jε″r
of a dipolar medium through the use of a single relaxation time τ to describe the sluggishness of the dipoles
driven by the external ac field.
Dielectric is a material in which energy can be stored
by the polarization of the molecules. It is a material
that increases the capacitance or charge storage ability
of a capacitor. Ideally, it is a nonconductor of electrical
charge so that an applied field does not cause a flow of
charge but instead relative displacement of opposite
charges and hence polarization of the medium.
Dielectric loss is the electrical energy lost as heat in
the polarization process in the presence of an applied
ac field. The energy is absorbed from the ac voltage
and converted to heat during the polarization of the

molecules. It should not be confused with conduction
loss σE 2 or V 2∕R.
Dielectric strength is the maximum field (Ebr) that
can be sustained in a dielectric beyond which dielectric
breakdown ensues; that is, there is a large conduction
current through the dielectric shorting the plates.
Dipolar (orientational) polarization arises when
randomly oriented polar molecules in a dielectric are
rotated and aligned by the application of a field so as to
give rise to a net average dipole moment per molecule.
In the absence of the field, the dipoles (polar molecules) are randomly oriented and there is no average
dipole moment per molecule. In the presence of the
field, the dipoles are rotated, some partially and some
fully, to align with the field and hence give rise to a net
dipole moment per molecule.
Dipolar relaxation equation describes the time response of the induced dipole moment per molecule in
a dipolar material in the presence of a time-dependent
applied field. The response of the dipoles depends on
their relaxation time, which is the mean time required
to dissipate the stored electrostatic energy in the dipole
alignment to heat through lattice vibrations or molecular collisions.
Dipole relaxation (dielectric resonance) occurs
when the frequency of the applied ac field is such that
there is maximum energy transfer from the ac voltage
source to heat in the dielectric through the alternating
polarization and depolarization of the molecules by the
ac field. The stored electrostatic energy is dissipated
through molecular collisions and lattice vibrations (in
solids). The peak occurs when the angular frequency of
the ac field is the reciprocal of the relaxation time.
Electric dipole moment exists when a positive
charge +Q is separated from a negative charge −Q.
Even though the net charge is zero, there is nonetheless an electric dipole moment p given by p = Qx
where x is the distance vector from −Q to +Q. Just as
two charges exert a Coulombic force on each other,
two dipoles also exert a force on each other that depends
on the magnitudes of the dipoles, their separation, and
orientation.

DEFINING TERMS
Electric susceptibility (χe) is a material quantity that
measures the extent of polarization in the material
per unit field. It relates the amount of polarization
P at a point in the dielectric to the field E at that point
via P = χeεoE. If εr is the relative permittivity, then
χe = εr − 1. Vacuum has no electric susceptibility.
Electromechanical breakdown and electrofracture
are breakdown processes that directly or indirectly involve electric field–induced mechanical weakening,
for example, crack propagation, or mechanical deformation that eventually lead to dielectric breakdown.
Electronic bond polarization is the displacement of
valence electrons in the bonds in covalent solids (e.g.,
Ge, Si). It is a collective displacement of the electrons
in the bonds with respect to the positive nuclei.
Electronic polarization is the displacement of the
electron cloud of an atom with respect to the positive
nucleus. Its contribution to the relative permittivity of
a solid is usually small.
External discharges are discharges or shorting currents over the surface of the insulator when the conductance of the surface increases as a result of surface
contamination, for example, excessive moisture, deposition of pollutants, dirt, dust, and salt spraying. Eventually the contaminated surface develops sufficient
conductance to allow discharge between the electrodes
at a field below the normal breakdown strength of the
insulator. Dielectric breakdown over the surface of an
insulation is termed surface tracking.
Ferroelectricity is the occurrence of spontaneous polarization in certain crystals such as barium titanate
(BaTiO3). Ferroelectric crystals have a permanent polarization P as a result of spontaneous polarization.
The direction of P can be defined by the application of
an external field.
Gauss’s law is a fundamental law of physics that relates the surface integral of the electric field over a
closed (hypothetical) surface to the sum of all the
charges enclosed within the surface. If En is the field
normal to a small surface area dA and Qtotal is the enclosed total charge, then over the whole closed surface
εo ∮ En dA = Qtotal.
Induced polarization is the polarization of a molecule as a result of its placement in an electric field. The

751

induced polarization is along the direction of the field.
If the molecule is already polar, then induced polarization is the additional polarization that arises due to the
applied field alone and it is directed along the field.
Insulation aging is a term used to describe the physical and chemical deterioration in the properties of the
insulation so that its dielectric breakdown characteristics worsen with time. Aging therefore determines the
useful life of the insulation.
Interfacial polarization occurs whenever there is an
accumulation of charge at an interface between two
materials or between two regions within a material.
Grain boundaries and electrodes are regions where
charges generally accumulate and give rise to this type
of polarization.
Internal discharges are partial discharges that take
place in microstructural voids, cracks, or pores within
the dielectric where the gas atmosphere (usually air)
has lower dielectric strength. A porous ceramic, for
example, would experience partial discharges if the
field is sufficiently large. Initially, the pore size (or
the number of pores) may be small and the partial
discharge insignificant, but with time the partial
discharge erodes the internal surfaces of the void.
Eventually (and usually) an electrical tree type of
discharge develops from a partial discharge that has
been eroding the dielectric. The erosion of the dielectric by the partial discharge propagates like a branching tree. The “tree branches” are erosion channels,
filaments of various sizes, in which gaseous discharge
takes place and forms a conducting channel during
operation.
Intrinsic breakdown or electronic breakdown commonly involves the avalanche multiplication of electrons (and holes in solids) by impact ionization in the
presence of high electric fields. The large number of
free carriers generated by the avalanche of impact ionizations leads to a runaway current between the electrodes and hence to insulation breakdown.
Ionic polarization is the relative displacement of oppositely charged ions in an ionic crystal that results in
the polarization of the whole material. Typically, ionic
polarization is important in ionic crystals below the
infrared wavelengths.

752

CHAPTER 7

∙

DIELECTRIC MATERIALS AND INSULATION

Local field (Eloc) is the true field experienced by a
molecule in a dielectric that arises from the free charges
on the plates and all the induced dipoles surrounding
the molecule. The true field at a molecule is not simply
the applied field (V∕d) because of the field of the
neighboring induced dipoles.
Loss tangent or tan δ is the ratio of the dielectric constant’s imaginary part to the real part, ε″r ∕ε′r . The angle
δ is the phase angle between the capacitive current and
the total current. If there is no dielectric loss, then the
two currents are the same and δ = 0.
Partial discharge occurs when only a local region of
the dielectric is exhibiting discharge, so the discharge
does not directly connect the two electrodes.
Paschen’s law states that the breakdown voltage Vbr in
a gaseous discharge is a function of the product of gas
pressure and electrode separation (Pd) only.
Piezoelectric material has a noncentrosymmetric
crystal structure that leads to the generation of a polarization vector P, or charges on the crystal surfaces, upon
the application of a mechanical stress. When strained,
a piezoelectric crystal develops an internal field and
therefore exhibits a voltage difference between two of
its faces.
PLZT, lead lanthanum zirconate titanate, is a PZTtype material with lanthanum occupying the Pb site.
Polarizability (α) is the ability of an atom or molecule to become polarized in the presence of an electric
field. It is induced polarization in the molecule per unit
field along the field direction.
Polarization is the separation of positive and negative
charges in a system so that there is a net electric dipole
moment per unit volume.
Polarization vector (P) measures the extent of polarization in a unit volume of dielectric matter. It is the
vector sum of dielectric dipoles per unit volume. If p is
the average dipole moment per molecule and n is the
number of molecules per unit volume, then P = np. In
a polarized dielectric matter (e.g., in an electric field),
the bound surface charge density σp due to polarization
is equal to the normal component of P at that point,
σp = Pnormal.
Poling is the application of a temporary electric field
to a piezoelectric (or ferroelectric) material, generally

at an elevated temperature, to align the polarizations
of various grains and thereby develop piezoelectric
behavior.
Pyroelectric material is a polar dielectric (such as
barium titanate) in which a temperature change ΔT induces a proportional change ΔP in the polarization,
that is, ΔP = p ΔT, where p is the pyroelectric coefficient of the crystal.
PZT is a general acronym for the lead zirconate titanate (PbZrO3-PbTiO3 or PbTi0.48Zr0.52O3) family of
crystals.
Q-factor or quality factor for an impedance is the
ratio of its reactance to its resistance. The Q-factor of
a capacitor is Xc∕Rp where Xc = 1∕ωC and Rp is the
equivalent parallel resistance that represents the dielectric and conduction losses. The Q-factor of a
resonant circuit measures the circuit’s peak response
at the resonant frequency and also its bandwidth.
The greater the Q, the higher the peak response and
the narrower the bandwidth. For a series RLC resonant circuit,
Q=

ω oL
1
=
R
ωoCR

where ωo is the resonant angular frequency, ωo =
1∕ √LC. The width of the resonant response curve between half-power points is Δω = ωo∕Q.
Relative permittivity (εr) or dielectric constant of a
dielectric is the fractional increase in the stored charge
per unit voltage on the capacitor plates due to the presence of the dielectric between the plates (the whole
space between the plates is assumed to be filled). Alternatively, we can define it as the fractional increase
in the capacitance of a capacitor when the insulation
between the plates is changed from a vacuum to a dielectric material, keeping the geometry the same.
Relaxation time (τ) is a characteristic time that determines the sluggishness of the dipole response to an applied field. It is the mean time for the dipole to lose its
alignment with the field due to its random interactions
with the other molecules through molecular collisions,
lattice vibrations, and so forth.
Surface tracking is an external dielectric breakdown
that occurs over the surface of the insulation.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) is the
fractional change in the capacitance per unit temperature change.
Thermal breakdown is a breakdown process that
involves thermal runaway, which leads to a runaway
current or discharge between the electrodes. If the
heat generated by dielectric loss, due to ε″r , or Joule
heating, due to finite σ, cannot be removed sufficiently rapidly, then the temperature of the dielectric rises, which increases the conductivity and the

dielectric loss. The increases in ε″r and σ lead to more
heat generation and a further rise in the temperature,
so thermal runaway ensues, followed by either a large
shorting current or local thermal decomposition of
the insulation accompanied by a partial discharge in
this region.
Transducer is a device that converts electrical energy
into another form of usable energy or vice versa. For
example, piezoelectric transducers convert electrical
energy to mechanical energy and vice versa.

Dielectric breakdown of gases and Paschen curves Dielectric breakdown in gases typically
involves the avalanche ionization of the gas molecules by energetic electrons accelerated by the applied

sufficient energy from the field to impact ionize the gas molecules. The breakdown voltage Vbr
between two electrodes depends on the distance d between the electrodes as well as the gas pressure

Dielectric breakdown in a coaxial cable Consider a coaxial underwater high-voltage cable as
in Figure 7.66a. The current flowing through the inner conductor generates heat, which has to
flow through the dielectric insulation to the outer conductor where it will be carried away by
conduction and convection. We will assume that steady state has been reached and the inner conductor is carrying a dc current I. Heat generated per unit second Q′ = dQ∕dt by Joule heating of the
inner conductor is

where ρ is the resistivity, a the radius of the conductor, and L the cable length.
This heat flows radially out from the inner conductor through the dielectric insulator to the outer
conductor, then to the ambient. This heat flow is by thermal conduction through the dielectric. The
rate of heat flow Q′ depends on the temperature difference Ti − To between the inner and outer
conductors; on the sample geometry (a, b, and L); and on the thermal conductivity κ of the dielectric.

Maximum field

cable

The dielectric breakdown occurs when Emax reaches the dielectric strength Ebr. However the
dielectric strength Ebr for many polymeric insulation materials depends on the temperature, and
generally it decreases with temperature, as shown for a typical example in Figure 7.66b. If the
load current I increases, then more heat Q′ is generated per second and this leads to a higher
inner core temperature Ti by virtue of Equation 7.100. The increase in Ti with I eventually lowers Ebr so much that it becomes equal to Emax and the insulation breaks down (thermal breakdown). Suppose that a certain coaxial cable has an aluminum inner conductor of diameter 10 mm
and resistivity 27 nΩ m. The insulation is 3 mm thick and is a polyethylene-based polymer whose
long-term dc dielectric strength is shown in Figure 7.66b. Suppose that the cable is carrying a
voltage of 40 kV and the outer shield temperature is the ambient temperature, 25 °C. Given that
the thermal conductivity of the polymer is about 0.3 W K−1 m−1, at what dc current will the
cable fail?
Rederive Ti in Equation 7.100 by considering that ρ depends on the temperature as ρ = ρo[1 +

each material? For quartz, Y = 80 GPa and ρ = 2.65 g cm−3. For PZT, Y = 70 GPa and ρ = 7.7 g m−3.
Assume that the velocity of mechanical oscillations in the crystal is v = √Y/ρ and the wavelength
λ = v∕fs. Consider only the fundamental mode (n = 1).

allow the radiation to fall on the detector for short periods of time. Each input radiation pulse has a
duration of Δt = 10 ms. (The time between the radiation pulses is long, so consider only the response
of the detector to a single pulse of radiation.) Suppose that all the incident radiation is absorbed. If
the input radiation has an intensity of 10 μW cm−2, calculate the pyroelectric current, and the maximum possible output voltage that can be generated assuming that the input impedance of the amplifier is sufficiently large to be negligible. What is the current responsivity of this detector? What are

*7.32

Pyroelectric detectors Consider a typical pyroelectric radiation detector circuit as shown in Figure 7.68.
The FET circuit acts as a voltage follower (source follower). The resistance R1 represents the
input resistance of the FET in parallel with a bias resistance that is usually inserted between the
gate and source. C1 is the overall input capacitance of the FET including any stray capacitance
but excluding the capacitance of the pyroelectric detector. Suppose that the incident radiation
intensity is constant and equal to I. Emissivity η of a surface characterizes what fraction of the
incident radiation that is absorbed? ηI is the energy absorbed per unit area per unit time. Some of
the absorbed energy will increase the temperature of the detector and some of it will be lost to
surroundings by thermal conduction and convection. Let the detector receiving area be A, thickness be L, density be ρ, and specific heat capacity (heat capacity per unit mass) be c. The heat
losses will be proportional to the temperature difference between the detector temperature T and
the ambient temperature To, as well as the surface area A (much greater than L). Energy balance
requires that
Rate of increase in the internal energy (heat content) of the detector
= Rate of energy absorption − Rate of heat losses
that is,
(ALρ)c

where K is a constant of proportionality that represents the heat losses and hence depends on the
thermal conductivity κ. If the heat loss involves pure thermal conduction from the detector surface to
the detector base (detector mount), then K = κ∕L. In practice, this is generally not the case and K = κ∕L
is an oversimplification.

of 3.2. Using Equations 7.96, 7.97, 7.102, calculate the expected effective dielectric constant if the
ILD is 30 percent porous? What should be the starting εr2 if we need an effective εreff less than 2
and the porosity cannot exceed 30 percent?

Magnetic Properties
and Superconductivity

Many electrical engineering devices such as inductors, transformers, rotating
machines, and ferrite antennas are based on utilizing the magnetic properties of
materials. There are many instances where permanent magnets are also used either
on their own or as part of a device such as a rotating machine or a loud speaker.
The majority of engineering devices make use of the ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties, which are therefore treated in much more detail than other magnetic
properties such as diamagnetism and paramagnetism. Although superconductivity
involves the vanishing of the resistivity of a conductor at low temperatures and is
normally explained within quantum mechanics, we treat the subject in this chapter
because all superconductors are perfect diamagnets and, further, they have present
or potential uses that involve magnetic fields. The advent of high-Tc superconductivity, discovered in 1986 by George Bednorz and Alex Müller at IBM Research
Laboratories in Zürich, is undoubtedly one of the most significant discoveries over
the last 50. High-Tc superconductors are already finding applications in such devices
as superconducting solenoids, sensitive magnetometers, and high-Q microwave filters, power cables and superconducting current limiters and so on. Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is probably one of the most exciting discoveries in the field of
sprintronics, that is, spin transport electronics. GMR is a phenomenon that depends
on the spin of the electron as it passes from one thin ferromagnetic layer to an
adjacent antiferromagnetic layer. Its best known application is in the read heads of
magnetic hard drives.

8.1.1 MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT

Definition of
magnetic
moment

Magnetic properties of materials involve concepts based on the magnetic dipole
moment. Consider a current loop, as shown in Figure 8.1, where the circulating current is I. This may, for example, be a coil carrying a current. For simplicity we will
assume that the current loop lies within a single plane. The area enclosed by the
current is A. Suppose that un is a unit vector coming out from the area A. The direction of un is such that looking along it, the current circulates clockwise. Then the
magnetic dipole moment, or simply the magnetic moment μm, is defined by1
μm = IAun

[8.1]

When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque
that tries to rotate the magnetic moment to align its axis with the magnetic field, as
depicted in Figure 8.2. Moreover, since a magnetic moment is a current loop, it gives
rise to a magnetic field B around it, as shown in Figure 8.3, which is similar to the
magnetic field around a bar magnet. We can find the field B from the current I and

its geometry, which are treated in various physics textbooks. For example, the field
B at a point P at a distance r along the axis of the coil from the center, as shown
in Figure 8.3, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic moment but
inversely proportional to r3, that is, B ∝ μm ∕r3.

8.1.2 ATOMIC MAGNETIC MOMENTS
An orbiting electron in an atom behaves much like a current loop and has a magnetic
dipole moment associated with it, called the orbital magnetic moment (μorb), as
illustrated in Figure 8.4. If ω is the angular frequency of the electron, then the
current I due to the orbiting electron is
I = Charge flowing per unit time = −

e
eω

Period
2π

If r is the radius of the orbit, then the magnetic dipole moment is
μorb = I(πr2 ) = −

But the velocity v of the electron is ωr and its orbital angular momentum is
L = (mev)r = meωr2

Using this in μorb, we get
e
μorb = −
L
2me

[8.2]

We see that the magnetic moment is proportional to the orbital angular momentum through a factor that has the charge to mass ratio of the electron. The numerical
factor, in this case e∕2me, relating the angular momentum to the magnetic moment,
is called the gyromagnetic ratio. The negative sign in Equation 8.2 indicates that
μorb is in the opposite direction to L and is due to the negative charge of the electron.
The electron also has an intrinsic angular momentum S, that is, spin. The spin
of the electron has a spin magnetic moment, denoted by μspin, but the relationship
between μspin and S is not the same as that in Equation 8.2. The gyromagnetic ratio
is a factor of 2 greater,
μspin = −

The overall magnetic moment of the electron consists of μorb and μspin appropriately added. We cannot simply add them numerically as they are vector quantities.
Furthermore, the overall magnetic moment μatom of the atom itself depends on the
orbital motions and spins of all the electrons. Electrons in closed subshells, however,
do not contribute to the overall magnetic moment because for every electron with a
given L (or S), there is another one with an opposite L (or S). The reason is that
the direction of L is space quantized by mℓ and all negative and positive values of
mℓ are occupied in a closed shell. Similarly, there are as many electrons spinning up
as there are spinning down, so there is no net electron spin in a closed shell and no
net μspin. Thus, only unfilled subshells contribute to the overall magnetic moment
of an atom.
Consider an atom that has closed inner shells and a single electron in an s orbital
(ℓ = 0). This means that the orbital magnetic moment is zero and the atom has a
magnetic moment due to the spin of the electron alone, μatom = μspin. In the presence
of an external magnetic field along the z direction, the magnetic moment cannot
simply rotate and align with the field because quantum mechanics requires the spin
angular momentum to be space quantized, that is, Sz (the component of S along z)
must be msħ where ms = ±21 is the spin magnetic quantum number. The torque
experienced by the spinning electron causes the spin magnetic moment to precess
about the external magnetic field, as shown in Figure 8.5. This precession is such
that Sz = −12 ħ and leads to an average magnetic moment μz along the field given by
Equation 8.3 with Sz, that is,

The quantity β = eħ∕2me is called the Bohr magneton and has the value 9.27 ×

Thus, the spin of a single electron has a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton
along the field.

8.1.3 MAGNETIZATION VECTOR M

vacuum) as the medium inside the solenoid, as shown in Figure 8.6a. The magnetic

field inside the solenoid is denoted by Bo to specifically identify this field as in free
space. This field depends on the current I through the solenoid wire and the number
of turns per unit length n and is given by2
Bo = μonI = μoI′

[8.5]

where I′ is the current per unit length of the solenoid, that is, I′ = nI, and μo is the
absolute permeability of free space in henries per meter, H m−1.
If we now place a cylindrical material medium to fill the inside of this solenoid,
as in Figure 8.6b, we find that the magnetic field has changed. The new magnetic
field in the presence of a medium is denoted as B. We will take Bo to be the applied
magnetic field into which the material medium is placed.
Each atom of the material responds to the applied field Bo and develops, or
acquires, a net magnetic moment μm along the applied field. We can view each
magnetic moment μm as the result of the precession of each atomic magnetic moment
about Bo. The medium therefore develops a net magnetic moment along the field
and becomes magnetized. The magnetic vector M describes the extent of magnetization of the medium. M is defined as the magnetic dipole moment per unit
volume. Suppose that there are N atoms in a small volume ΔV and each atom i has
a magnetic moment μmi (where i = 1 to N). Then M is defined by
M=

1 N
∑ μmi = nat μav
ΔV i=1

[8.6]

where nat is the number of atoms per unit volume and μav is the average magnetic
moment per atom. We can assume that each atom acquires a magnetic moment μav
along Bo. Each of these magnetic moments along Bo can be viewed as an elementary
current loop at the atomic scale, as schematically depicted in Figure 8.6b. These
elementary current loops are due to electronic currents within the atom and arise
from both orbital and spin motions of the electrons. Each current loop has its current
plane normal to Bo.

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
Surface currents

Figure 8.7 Elementary current loops result in surface currents.
There is no internal current, as adjacent currents on neighboring
loops are in opposite directions.

Surface currents

Consider a cross section of the magnetized medium, as in Figure 8.7. All the
elementary current loops in this plane have the current circulation in the same direction inasmuch as each atom acquires the same magnetic moment μav. All neighboring loops in the bulk have adjacent currents in opposite directions that cancel each
other, as apparent in Figure 8.7. Thus, there are no net bulk currents, or internal
currents, within the bulk of the material. However, the currents at the surface in the
surface loops cannot be canceled and this leads to a net surface current, as depicted
in Figure 8.7. The surface currents are induced by the magnetization of the medium
by the applied magnetic field and therefore depend on the magnetization M of the
specimen.
From the definition of M, the total magnetic moment of the cylindrical specimen is
Total magnetic moment = M (Volume) = MAℓ

Suppose that the magnetization current on the surface per unit length of the
specimen is Im. Then the total circulating surface current is Imℓ and the total magnetic
moment of the specimen, by definition, is
Total magnetic moment = (Total current) × (Cross-sectional area) = ImℓA
Magnetization
and surface
currents

Equating the two total magnetic moments, we find
M = Im

[8.7]

We derived this for a particular sample geometry, a cylindrical specimen, in
which M is along the axis of the cylindrical specimen and Im flows in a plane perpendicular to M. The relationship, however, is more general, as derived in more
advanced texts. It should be emphasized that the magnetization current Im is not due
to the flow of free charge carriers, as in a current-carrying copper wire, but due to
localized electronic currents within the atoms of the solid at the surface. Equation
8.7 states that we can represent the magnetization of a medium by a surface current
per unit length Im that is equal to M.

8.1.4 MAGNETIZING FIELD OR MAGNETIC FIELD INTENSITY H
The magnetized specimen in Figure 8.6b placed inside the solenoid develops magnetization currents on the surface. It therefore behaves like a solenoid. We can now
regard the solenoid with medium inside, as depicted in Figure 8.8. The magnetic
field within the medium now arises from not only the conduction current per unit
length I′ in the solenoid wires but also from the magnetization current Im on the
surface. The magnetic field B inside the solenoid is now given by the usual solenoid
expression but with a current that includes both I′ and Im, as shown in Figure 8.8:
B = μo(I′ + Im) = Bo + μoM

This relationship is generally valid and can be written in vector form as
B = Bo + μoM

[8.8]

The field at a point inside a magnetized material is the sum of the applied field
Bo and a contribution from the magnetization M of the material. The magnetization
arises from the application of Bo due to the current of free carriers in the solenoid
wires, called the conduction current, which we can externally adjust. It becomes
useful to introduce a vector field that represents the effect of the external or conduction current alone. In general, B − μoM at a point is the contribution of the external
currents alone to the magnetic field at that point inside the material that we called
Bo. B − μoM represents a magnetizing field because it is the field of the external
currents that magnetize the material. The magnetizing field H is defined as
H=

1
B−M
μo

[8.9]

or
H=

B
μo o

The magnetizing field is also known as the magnetic field intensity and is
measured in A m−1. The reason for the division by μo is that the resulting vector field
H becomes simply related to the external conduction currents (through Ampere’s law).
Since in the solenoid Bo is μonI, we see that the magnetizing field in a solenoid is

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

It is generally helpful to imagine H as the cause and B as the effect. The cause
H depends only on the external conduction currents, whereas the effect B depends
on the magnetization M of matter.

8.1.5 MAGNETIC PERMEABILITY AND MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY
Suppose that at a point P in a material, the magnetic field is B and the magnetizing
field is H. We let Bo be the magnetic field at P in the absence of any material (i.e.,
in free space). The magnetic permeability of the medium at P is defined as the
magnetic field per unit magnetizing field,
Definition of
magnetic
permeability

μ=

H

[8.11]

It relates the effect B to the cause H at the same point P inside a material. In
simple qualitative terms, μ represents to what extent a medium is permeable by
magnetic fields. Relative permeability μr of a medium is the fractional increase in
the magnetic field with respect to the field in free space when a material medium
is introduced. For example, suppose that the field in a solenoid with free space in it
is Bo but with material inserted it is B. Then μr is defined by

[8.13]

The magnetization M produced in a material depends on the net magnetic field B.
It would be natural to proceed as in dielectrics by relating M to B analogously to
relating P (polarization) to E (electric field). However, for historic reasons, M is related
to H, the magnetizing field. Suppose that the medium is isotropic (same properties in
all directions), then magnetic susceptibility χm of the medium is defined simply by
M = χmH

[8.14]

This relationship is not obeyed by all magnetic materials. For example, as we will
see later, ferromagnetic materials do not obey Equation 8.12. Since the magnetic field
B = μo(H + M)

[8.15]

we have
B = μoH + μoM = μoH + μoχmH = μo(1 + χm)H

and
μr = 1 + χm

[8.16]

The presence of a magnetizable material is conveniently accounted for by using
the relative permeability μr, or (1 + χm), to simply multiply μo. Alternatively, one
can simply replace μo with μ = μoμr. For example, the inductance of the solenoid
with a magnetic medium inside increases by a factor of μr.

definitions, and units.

AMPERE’S LAW AND THE INDUCTANCE OF A TOROIDAL COIL Ampere’s law provides
a relationship between the conduction current I and the magnetic field intensity H threading
this current. The conduction current I is the current due to the flow of free charge carriers
through a conductor and not due to the magnetization of any medium. Consider an arbitrary
closed path C around a conductor carrying a current I, as shown in Figure 8.9. The tangential
component of H to the curve C at point P is Ht. If dl is an infinitesimally small path length
of C at P, as shown in Figure 8.9, then the summation of Ht dl around the path C gives the
conduction current enclosed within C. This is Ampere’s law,

Consider the toroidal coil with N turns shown in Figure 8.10. First assume that the toroid
core is air (μr ≈ 1). Suppose that the current through the coils is I. By symmetry, the magnetic
field intensity H inside the toroidal core is the same everywhere and is directed along the
circumference. Suppose that l is the length of the mean circumference C. The current is linked
N times by the circumference C, so Equation 8.17 is

or

The magnetic field Bo with air as core material is then simply
Bo = μoH =

μoNI

When the toroidal coil has a magnetic medium with a relative permeability μr, the magnetic field intensity is still H because the conduction current I has not changed. But the
magnetic field B is now different than Bo and is given by

If A is the cross-sectional area of the toroid, then the total flux Φ through the core is

the toroidal coil, by definition, is then

is energized from a voltage supply through a rheostat, as shown in Figure 8.11. The core of

i supplied to the coil. The current i produces magnetic flux Φ in the core, which is BA, where
B is the magnetic field and A is the cross-sectional area. We can now use Ampere’s law for
H to relate the current i to H, as in Example 8.1. If ℓ is the mean circumference, then
Hℓ = Ni

[8.20]

The changing current means that the flux is also changing (both increasing). We know
from Faraday’s law that a changing flux that threads a circuit generates a voltage v in that
circuit given by the rate of change of total threaded flux, or NΦ. Lenz’s law makes the polarity of the induced voltage oppose the applied voltage. Suppose that in a time interval δt
seconds, the magnetic field within the core changes by δB; then δΦ = AδB and
v=

δ(Total flux threaded) NδΦ
δB

δt

[8.21]

The battery has to supply the current i against this induced voltage v, which means
that it has to do electrical work iv every second. In other words, the battery has to do work
iv δt in a time interval δt to supply the necessary current to increase the magnetic field
by δB. The electric energy δE that is input into the coil in time δt is then, using Equations 8.20 and 8.21,
δE = iv δt = (

Hℓ
δB
NA
δt = (Aℓ)H δB
N )( δt )

This energy δE is the work done in increasing the field in the core by δB. The volume
of the toroid is Aℓ. Therefore, the total energy or work required per unit volume to increase
the magnetic field from an initial value B1 to a final value B2 in the toroid is
Evol =

B2

∫ H dB

[8.22]

B1

where the integration limits are determined by the initial and final magnetic field. This is the
expression for calculating the energy density (energy per unit volume) required to change
the field from B1 to B2. It should be emphasized that Equation 8.22 is valid for any medium.
We conclude that an incremental energy density of dEvol = H dB is required to increase the
magnetic field by dB at a point in any medium including free space.
We can now consider a core material that we can represent by a constant relative permeability μr. This means we can exclude those materials that do not have a linear relationship
between B and H, such as ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, which we will discuss
later. If the core is free space or air, then μr = 1.
Suppose that we increase the current in Figure 8.11 from zero to some final value I so
that the magnetic field changes from zero to some final value B. Since the medium has a
constant relative permeability μr, we can write
B = μrμoH

This is the energy absorbed from the battery per unit volume of core medium to establish the magnetic field. This energy is stored in the magnetic field and is called magnetostatic
energy density. It is a form of magnetic potential energy. If we were to suddenly remove the
battery and short those terminals, the current will continue to flow for a short while (determined by L∕R) and do external work in heating the resistor. This external work comes from
the stored energy in the magnetic field. If the medium is free space, or air, then the energy

MAGNETIC MATERIAL CLASSIFICATIONS

In general, magnetic materials are classified into five distinct groups: diamagnetic,
paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic. Table 8.2 provides
a summary of the magnetic properties of these classes of materials.

8.2.1 DIAMAGNETISM
Typical diamagnetic materials have a magnetic susceptibility that is negative and
small. For example, the silicon crystal is diamagnetic with χm = −5.2 × 10−6. The
relative permeability of diamagnetic materials is slightly less than unity. When a
diamagnetic substance such as a silicon crystal is placed in a magnetic field, the
magnetization vector M in the material is in the opposite direction to the applied
field μoH and the resulting field B within the material is less than μoH. The negative
susceptibility can be interpreted as the diamagnetic substance trying to expel the
applied field from the material. When a diamagnetic specimen is placed in a nonuniform magnetic field, the magnetization M of the material is in the opposite direction to B and the specimen experiences a net force toward smaller fields, as depicted
in Figure 8.12. A substance exhibits diamagnetism whenever the constituent atoms
in the material have closed subshells and shells. This means that each constituent
atom has no permanent magnetic moment in the absence of an applied field. Covalent
crystals and many ionic crystals are typical diamagnetic materials because the

constituent atoms have no unfilled subshells. Superconductors, as we will discuss
later, are perfect diamagnets with χm = −1 and totally expel the applied field from
the material.

8.2.2 PARAMAGNETISM
Paramagnetic materials have a small positive magnetic susceptibility. For example,
oxygen gas is paramagnetic with χm = 2.1 × 10−6 at atmospheric pressure and room
temperature. Each oxygen molecule has a net magnetic dipole moment μmol. In
the absence of an applied field, these molecular moments are randomly oriented
due to the random collisions of the molecules, as depicted in Figure 8.13a. The
magnetization of the gas is zero. In the presence of an applied field, the molecular magnetic moments take various alignments with the field, as illustrated in
Figure 8.13b. The degree of alignment of μmol with the applied field and hence
magnetization M increases with the strength of the applied field μoH. Magnetization M typically decreases with increasing temperature because at higher temperatures there are more molecular collisions, which destroy the alignments of
molecular magnetic moments with the applied field. When a paramagnetic substance is placed in a nonuniform magnetic field, the induced magnetization M is
along B and there is a net force toward greater fields. For example, when liquid
oxygen is poured close to a strong magnet, as depicted in Figure 8.14, the liquid
becomes attracted to the magnet.
Many metals are also paramagnetic, such as magnesium with χm = 1.2 × 10−5.
The origin of paramagnetism (called Pauli spin paramagnetism) in these metals
is due to the alignment of the majority of spins of conduction electrons with
the field.

MAGNETIC MATERIAL CLASSIFICATIONS

8.2.3 FERROMAGNETISM
Ferromagnetic materials such as iron can possess large permanent magnetizations
even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility χm
is typically positive and very large (even infinite) and, further, depends on the
applied field intensity. The relationship between the magnetization M and
the applied magnetic field μoH is highly nonlinear. At sufficiently high fields, the
magnetization M of the ferromagnet saturates. The origin of ferromagnetism is
the quantum mechanical exchange interaction (discussed later) between the constituent atoms that results in regions of the material possessing permanent magnetization. Figure 8.15 depicts a region of the Fe crystal, called a magnetic
domain, that has a net magnetization vector M due to the alignment of the magnetic moments of all Fe atoms in this region. This crystal domain has magnetic
ordering as all the atomic magnetic moments have been aligned parallel to each
other. Ferromagnetism occurs below a critical temperature called the Curie temperature TC. At temperatures above TC, ferromagnetism is lost and the material
becomes paramagnetic.

8.2.4 ANTIFERROMAGNETISM
Antiferromagnetic materials such as chromium have a small but positive susceptibility. They cannot possess any magnetization in the absence of an applied field, in
contrast to ferromagnets. Antiferromagnetic materials possess a magnetic ordering
in which the magnetic moments of alternating atoms in the crystals align in opposite
directions, as schematically depicted in Figure 8.16. The opposite alignments of
atomic magnetic moments are due to quantum mechanical exchange forces (described
later in Section 8.3). The net result is that in the absence of an applied field, there
is no net magnetization. Antiferromagnetism occurs below a critical temperature
called the Néel temperature TN. Above TN, antiferromagnetic material becomes
paramagnetic.

8.2.5 FERRIMAGNETISM
Ferrimagnetic materials such as ferrites (e.g., Fe3O4) exhibit magnetic behavior similar to ferromagnetism below a critical temperature called the Curie temperature TC.
Above TC they become paramagnetic. The origin of ferrimagnetism is based on
magnetic ordering, as schematically illustrated in Figure 8.17. All A atoms have their
spins aligned in one direction and all B atoms have their spins aligned in the opposite direction. As the magnetic moment of an A atom is greater than that of a B
atom, there is net magnetization M in the crystal. Unlike the antiferromagnetic case,
the oppositely directed magnetic moments have different magnitudes and do not
cancel. The net effect is that the crystal can possess magnetization even in the
absence of an applied field. Since ferrimagnetic materials are typically nonconducting and therefore do not suffer from eddy current losses, they are widely used in
high-frequency electronics applications.
All useful magnetic materials in electrical engineering are invariably ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic.

8.3

FERROMAGNETISM ORIGIN
AND THE EXCHANGE INTERACTION

The transition metals iron, cobalt, and nickel are all ferromagnetic at room temperature. The rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium are ferromagnetic
below room temperature. Ferromagnetic materials can exhibit permanent magnetization even in the absence of an applied field; that is, they possess a susceptibility
that is infinite.
In a magnetized iron crystal, all the atomic magnetic moments are aligned in
the same direction, as illustrated in Figure 8.15, where the moments in this case have
all been aligned along the [100] direction, which gives net magnetization along this
direction. It may be thought that the reason for the alignment of the moments is the
magnetic forces between the moments, just as bar magnets will tend to align head
to tail in an SNSN . . . fashion. This is not, however, the cause, as the magnetic
potential energy of interaction is small, indeed smaller than the thermal energy.
The iron atom has the electron structure [Ar]3d 64s2. An isolated iron atom has
only the 3d subshell with four of the five orbitals unfilled. By virtue of Hund’s rule,
the electrons try to align their spins so that the five 3d orbitals contain two paired

electrons and four unpaired electrons, as in Figure 8.18. The isolated atom has four
parallel electron spins and hence a spin magnetic moment of 4β.
The origin of Hund’s rule, visualized in Figure 8.19, lies in the fact that when
the spins are parallel (same ms), as a requirement of the Pauli exclusion principle,
the electrons must occupy orbitals with different mℓ and hence possess different
spatial distributions (recall that mℓ determines the orientation of an orbit). Different
mℓ values result in a smaller Coulombic repulsion energy between the electrons
compared with the case where the electrons have opposite spins (different ms), where
they would be in the same orbital (same mℓ), that is, in the same spatial region. It
is apparent that even though the interaction energy between the electrons has nothing
to do with magnetic forces, it does depend nonetheless on the orientations of their
spins (ms), or on their spin magnetic moments, and it is less when the spins are
parallel. Two electrons parallel their spins not because of the direct magnetic interaction between the spin magnetic moments but because of the Pauli exclusion
principle and the electrostatic interaction energy. Together they constitute what is
known as an exchange interaction, which forces two electrons to take ms and mℓ
values that result in the minimum of electrostatic energy. In an atom, the exchange
interaction therefore forces two electrons to take the same ms but different mℓ if this
can be done within the Pauli exclusion principle. This is the reason an isolated Fe
atom has four unpaired spins in the 3d subshell.
In the crystal, of course, the outer electrons are no longer strictly confined to
their parent Fe atoms, particularly the 4s electrons. The electrons now have wavefunctions that belong to the whole solid. Something like Hund’s rule also operates
at the crystal level for Fe, Co, and Ni. If two 3d electrons parallel their spins and
occupy different wavefunctions (and hence different negative charge distributions),
the resulting mutual Coulombic repulsion between them and also with all the other
electrons and the attraction to the positive Fe ions result in an overall reduction of
potential energy. This reduction in energy is again due to the exchange interaction
and is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle and the Coulombic
forces. Thus, the majority of 3d electrons spontaneously parallel their spins without
the need for the application of an external magnetic field. The number of electrons
that actually parallel their spins depends on the strength of the exchange interaction,
and for the iron crystal this turns out to be about 2.2 electrons per atom. Since
typically the wavefunctions of the 3d electrons in the whole iron crystal show

localization around the iron ions, some people prefer to view the 3d electrons as
spending the majority of their time around Fe atoms, which explains the reason for
drawing the magnetized iron crystal as in Figure 8.15.
It may be thought that all solids should follow the example of Fe and become
spontaneously ferromagnetic since paralleling spins would result in different spatial distributions of negative charge and probably a reduction in the electrostatic
energy, but this is not generally the case at all. We know that, in the case of covalent
bonding, the electrons have the lowest energy when the two electrons spin in
opposite directions. In covalent bonding in molecules, the exchange interaction does
not reduce the energy. Making the electron spins parallel leads to spatial negative
charge distributions that result in a net mutual electrostatic repulsion between the
positive nuclei.
In the simplest case, for two atoms only, the exchange energy depends on the
interatomic separation between two interacting atoms and the relative spins of the
two outer electrons (labeled as 1 and 2). From quantum mechanics, the exchange
interaction can be represented in terms of an exchange energy Eex as
Eex = −2JeS1 · S2

[8.25]

where S1 and S2 are the spin angular momenta of the two electrons and Je is a
numerical quantity called the exchange integral that involves integrating the wavefunctions with the various potential energy interaction terms. It therefore depends
on the electrostatic interactions and hence on the interatomic distance. For the majority of solids, Je is negative, so the exchange energy is negative if S1 and S2 are in
the opposite directions, that is, the spins are antiparallel (as we found in covalent
bonding). This is the antiferromagnetic state. For Fe, Co, and Ni, however, Je is
positive. Eex is then negative if S1 and S2 are parallel. Spins of the 3d electrons on
the Fe atoms therefore spontaneously align in the same direction to reduce the
exchange energy. This spontaneous magnetization is the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. Figure 8.20 illustrates how Je changes with the ratio of interatomic separation
to the radius of the 3d subshell (r∕rd). For the transition metals Fe, Co, and Ni, the
r∕rd is such that Je is positive.3 In all other cases, it is negative and does not produce
ferromagnetic behavior. It should be mentioned that Mn, which is not ferromagnetic,

can be alloyed with other elements to increase r∕rd and hence endow ferromagnetism
in the alloy.
The maximum magnetization, called saturation
magnetization Msat, in iron is about 1.75 × 106 A m−1. This corresponds to all possible net
spins aligning parallel to each other. Calculate the effective number of Bohr magnetons per
atom that would give Msat, given that the density and relative atomic mass of iron are 7.86 g cm−3

In the solid, each Fe atom contributes only 2.2 Bohr magnetons to the magnetization
even though the isolated Fe atom has 4 Bohr magnetons. There is no orbital contribution to
the magnetic moment per atom in the solid because all the outer electrons, 3d and 4s electrons,
can be viewed as belonging to the whole crystal, or being in an energy band, rather than
orbiting individual atoms. A 3d electron is attracted by various Fe ions in the crystal and
therefore does not experience a central force, in contrast to the 3d electron in the isolated Fe
atom that orbits the nucleus. The orbital momentum in the crystal is said to be quenched.
We should note that when the magnetization is saturated, all atomic magnetic moments
are aligned. The resulting magnetic field within the iron specimen in the absence of an applied
magnetizing field (H = 0) is
Bsat = μoMsat = 2.2 T

SATURATION MAGNETIZATION
AND CURIE TEMPERATURE

The maximum magnetization in a ferromagnet when all the atomic magnetic moments
have been aligned as much as possible is called the saturation magnetization Msat.
In the iron crystal, for example, this corresponds to each Fe atom with an effective
spin magnetic moment of 2.2 Bohr magnetons aligning in the same direction to give
a magnetic field μoMsat or 2.2 T. As we increase the temperature, lattice vibrations
become more energetic, which leads to a frequent disruption of the alignments of
the spins. The spins cannot align perfectly with each other as the temperature

increases due to lattice vibrations randomly agitating the individual spins. When an
energetic lattice vibration passes through a spin site, the energy in the vibration may
be sufficient to disorientate the spin of the atom. The ferromagnetic behavior disappears at a critical temperature called the Curie temperature, denoted by TC, when
the thermal energy of lattice vibrations in the crystal can overcome the potential
energy of the exchange interaction and hence destroy the spin alignments. Above the
Curie temperature, the crystal behaves as if it were paramagnetic. The saturation
magnetization Msat, therefore, decreases from its maximum value Msat(0) at absolute
zero of temperature to zero at the Curie temperature. Figure 8.21 shows the dependence of Msat on the temperature when Msat has been normalized to Msat(0) and the
temperature is the reduced temperature, that is, T∕TC. At T∕TC = 1, Msat = 0. When
plotted in this way, the ferromagnets cobalt and nickel follow closely the observed
behavior for iron. We should note that since for iron TC = 1043 K, at room temperature, T∕TC = 0.29 and Msat is very close to its value at Msat(0).
Since at the Curie temperature, the thermal energy, of the order of kTC, is sufficient to overcome the energy of the exchange interaction Eex that aligns the spins,
we can take kTC as an order of magnitude estimate of Eex. For iron, Eex is ∼0.09 eV
and for cobalt this is ∼0.1 eV.

MAGNETIC DOMAINS:
FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS

8.5.1 MAGNETIC DOMAINS
A single crystal of iron does not necessarily possess a net permanent magnetization
in the absence of an applied field. If a magnetized piece of iron is heated to a temperature above its Curie temperature and then allowed to cool in the absence of a
magnetic field, it will possess no net magnetization. The reason for the absence of
net magnetization is due to the formation of magnetic domains that effectively cancel each other, as discussed below. A magnetic domain is a region of the crystal in
which all the spin magnetic moments are aligned to produce a magnetic moment in
one direction only.
Figure 8.22a shows a single crystal of iron that has a permanent magnetization
as a result of ferromagnetism (aligning of all atomic spins). The crystal is like a bar
magnet with magnetic field lines around it. As we know, there is potential energy
(PE), called magnetostatic energy, stored in a magnetic field, and we can reduce
this energy in the external field by dividing the crystal into two domains where the
magnetizations are in the opposite directions, as shown in Figure 8.22b. The external
magnetic field lines are reduced and there is now less potential energy stored in the
magnetic field. There are only field lines at the ends. This arrangement is energetically favorable because the magnetostatic energy has been reduced by decreasing the
external field lines. However, there is now a boundary, called a domain wall (or
Bloch wall), between the two domains where the magnetization changes from one
direction to the opposite direction and hence the atomic spins do, also. It requires

energy to rotate the atomic spin through 180° with respect to its neighbor because
the exchange energy favors aligning neighboring atomic spins (0°). The wall in
Figure 8.22b is a 180° wall inasmuch as the magnetization through the wall is rotated
by 180°. It is apparent that the wall region where the neighboring atomic spins
change their relative direction (or orientation) from one domain to the neighboring
one has higher PE than the bulk of the domain, where all the atomic spins are
aligned. As we will show below, the domain wall is not simply one atomic spacing
but has a finite thickness, which for iron is typically of the order of 0.1 μm, or
several hundred atomic spacings. The excess energy in the wall increases with the
area of the wall.
The magnetostatic energy associated with the field lines at the ends in Figure 8.22b
can be further reduced by eliminating these external field lines by closing the ends
with sideway domains with magnetizations at 90°, as shown in Figure 8.22c. These
end domains are closure domains and have walls that are 90° walls. The magnetization is rotated through 90° through the wall. Although we have reduced the magnetostatic energy, we have increased the potential energy in the walls by adding
additional walls. The creation of magnetic domains continues (spontaneously) until
the potential energy reduction in creating an additional domain is the same as the
increase in creating an additional wall. The specimen then possesses minimum potential energy and is in equilibrium with no net magnetization. Figure 8.22d shows a
specimen with several domains and no net magnetization. The sizes, shapes, and
distributions of domains depend on a number of factors, including the size and shape
of the whole specimen. For iron particles of dimensions less than of the order of
0.01 μm, the increase in the potential energy in creating a domain wall is too costly
and these particles are single domains and hence always magnetized.
The magnetization of each domain is normally along one of the preferred directions in which the atomic spin alignments are easiest (the exchange interaction is the
strongest). For iron, the magnetization is easiest along any one of six ⟨100⟩ directions
(along cube edges), which are called easy directions. The domains have magnetizations along these easy directions. The magnetization of the crystal along an applied
field occurs, in principle, by the growth of domains with magnetizations (or components of M) along the applied field (H), as illustrated in Figure 8.23a and b. For
simplicity, the magnetizing field is taken along an easy direction. The Bloch wall
between the domains A and B migrates toward the right, which enlarges the domain

external magnetic field is applied, the domain wall migrates
into domain B, which enlarges A and shrinks B. The result is
that the specimen now acquires net magnetization.

wall, and also spins in section B adjacent to the wall, being gradually rotated by the
applied field (they experience a torque). The magnetization process therefore involves
the motions of Bloch walls in the crystal.

8.5.2 MAGNETOCRYSTALLINE ANISOTROPY
Ferromagnetic crystals characteristically exhibit magnetic anisotropy, which means
that the magnetic properties are different along different crystal directions. In the
case of iron (BCC), the spins in a domain are most easily aligned in any of the six
[100] type directions, collectively labeled as ⟨100⟩, and correspond to the six edges
of the cubic unit cell. The exchange interactions are such that spin magnetic moments
are most easily aligned with each other if they all point in one of the six ⟨100⟩
directions. Thus ⟨100⟩ directions in the iron crystal constitute the easy directions for
magnetization. When a magnetizing field H along a [100] direction is applied, as
illustrated in Figure 8.23a and b, domain walls migrate to allow those domains (e.g., A)
with magnetizations along H to grow at the expense of those domains (e.g., B) with
magnetizations opposing H. The observed M versus H behavior is shown in
Figure 8.24. Magnetization rapidly increases and saturates with an applied field of
less than 0.01 T.
On the other hand, if we want to magnetize the crystal along the [111] direction
by applying a field along this direction, then we have to apply a stronger field than
that along [100]. This is clearly shown in Figure 8.24, where the resulting magnetization along [111] is smaller than that along [100] for the same magnitude of applied
field. Indeed, saturation is reached at an applied field that is about a factor of 4 greater

than that along [100]. The [111] direction in the iron crystal is consequently known
as the hard direction. The M versus H behavior along [100], [110], and [111]
directions in an iron crystal and the associated anisotropy are shown in Figure 8.24.
When an external field is applied along the diagonal direction OD in Figure 8.24,
initially all those domains with M along OA, OB, and OC, that is, those with magnetization components along OD, grow by consuming those with M in the wrong
direction and eventually take over the whole specimen. This is an easy process
(similar to the process along [100]) and requires small fields and represents the
processes from 0 to P on the magnetization curve for [111] in Figure 8.24. However,
from P onwards, the magnetizations in the domains have to be rotated away from
their easy directions, that is, from OA, OB, and OC toward OD. This process consumes substantial energy and hence needs much stronger applied fields.
It is apparent that the magnetization of the crystal along [100] needs the least
energy, whereas that along [111] consumes the greatest energy. The excess energy
required to magnetize a unit volume of a crystal in a particular direction with respect
to that in the easy direction is called the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and
is denoted by K. For iron, the anisotropy energy is zero for [100] and largest for
the [111] direction, about 48 kJ m−3 or 3.5 × 10−6 eV per atom. For cobalt, which
has the HCP crystal structure, the anisotropy energy is at least an order of magnitude
greater. Table 8.4 summarizes the easy and hard directions, and the anisotropy energy
K for the hard direction.

8.5.3 DOMAIN WALLS
We recall that the spin magnetic moments rotate across a domain wall. We mentioned that the wall is not simply one atomic spacing wide, as this would mean two
neighboring spins being at 180° to each other and hence possessing excessive
exchange interaction. A schematic illustration of the structure of a typical 180°
Bloch wall, between two domains A and B, is depicted in Figure 8.25. It can be
seen that the neighboring spin magnetic moments are rotated gradually, and over
several hundred atomic spacings the magnetic moment reaches a rotation of 180°.
Exchange forces between neighboring atomic spins favor very little relative rotation.

would be so minute that the wall would have to be very thick (infinitely thick) to
achieve a 180° rotation.
However, magnetic moments that are oriented away from the easy direction possess excess energy, called the anisotropy energy (K). If the wall is thick, then it will
contain many magnetic moments rotated away from the easy direction and there
would be a substantial anisotropy energy in the wall. Minimum anisotropy energy
in the wall is obtained when the magnetic moment changes direction by 180° from
the easy direction along +z to that along −z in Figure 8.25 without any intermediate
rotations away from z. This requires a wall of one atomic spacing. In reality, the wall
thickness is a compromise between the exchange energy, demanding a thick wall,
and anisotropy energy, demanding a thin wall. The equilibrium wall thickness is that
which minimizes the total potential energy, which is the sum of the exchange energy
and the anisotropy energy within the wall. This thickness turns out to be ∼0.1 μm
for iron and less for cobalt, in which the anisotropy energy is greater.

MAGNETIC DOMAIN WALL ENERGY AND THICKNESS The Bloch wall energy and thickness depend on two main factors: the exchange energy Eex (J atom−1) and magnetocrystalline
energy K (J m−3). Suppose that we consider a Bloch wall of unit area, and thickness δ, and
calculate the potential energy Uwall in this wall due to the exchange energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The spins change by 180° across the thickness δ of the Bloch
wall as in Figure 8.25. The contribution Uexchange from the exchange energy arises because it
takes energy to rotate one spin with respect to another. If the thickness δ is large, then the
angular change from one spin to the next will be small, and the exchange energy contribution
Uexchange will also be small. Thus, Uexchange is inversely proportional to δ. Uexchange is also
directly proportional to Eex which gauges the magnitude of this exchange energy; it costs Eex
to rotate the two spins 180° to each other. Thus, Uexchange ∝ Eex∕δ.
The anisotropy energy contribution Uanisotropy arises from having spins point away from
the easy direction. If the thickness δ is large, there are more and more spin moments that are
aligned away from the easy direction, and the anisotropy energy contribution Uanisotropy is also
large. Thus, Uanisotropy is proportional to δ, and also, obviously, to the anisotropy energy K that
gauges the magnitude of this energy. Thus, Uanisotropy ∝ Kδ.

Figure 8.26 shows the contributions of the exchange and anisotropy energies, Uexchange
and Uanisotropy, to the total Bloch wall energy as a function of wall thickness δ. It is clear that
exchange and anisotropy energies have opposite (or conflicting) requirements on the wall
thickness. There is, however, an optimum thickness δ′ that minimizes the Bloch wall energy,
that is, a thickness that balances the requirements of exchange and anisotropy forces.
If the interatomic spacing is a, then there would be N = δ∕a atomic layers in the wall.
Since the spin moment angle changes by 180° across δ, we can calculate the relative spin
orientations (180°∕N) of adjacent atomic layers, and hence we can find the exact contributions
of exchange and anisotropy energies. We do not need the exact mathematics, but the final
result is that the potential energy Uwall per unit area of the wall is approximately

It is left as an exercise to show that when δ = δ′, the exchange and anisotropy energy contributions are equal.

8.5.4 MAGNETOSTRICTION
If we were to strain a ferromagnetic crystal (by applying a suitable stress) along a
certain direction, we would change the interatomic spacing not only along this direction but also in other directions and hence change the exchange interactions between
the atomic spins. This would lead to a change in the magnetization properties of the
crystal. In the converse effect, the magnetization of the crystal generates strains or
changes in the physical dimensions of the crystal. For example, in very qualitative
terms, when an iron crystal is magnetized along the [111] direction by a strong field,
the atomic spins within domains are rotated from their easy directions toward the
hard [111] direction. These electron spin rotations involve changes in the electron
charge distributions around the atoms and therefore affect the interatomic bonding
and hence the interatomic spacing. When an iron crystal is placed in a magnetic field
along an easy direction [100], it gets longer along this direction but contracts in the
transverse directions [010] and [001], as depicted in Figure 8.27. The reverse is true
for nickel. The longitudinal strain Δℓ∕ℓ along the direction of magnetization is called
the magnetostrictive constant, denoted by λ. The magnetostrictive constant depends
on the crystal direction and may be positive (extension) or negative (contraction).
Further, λ depends on the applied field and can even change sign as the field is
increased; for example, λ for iron along the [110] direction is initially positive and
then, at higher fields, becomes negative. When the crystal reaches saturation magnetization, λ also reaches saturation, called saturation magnetostriction strain λsat,
which is typically 10−6–10−5. Table 8.4 summarizes the λsat values for Fe and Ni
along the easy and hard directions. The crystal lattice strain energy associated with
magnetostriction is called the magnetostrictive energy, which is typically less than
the anisotropy energy.
Magnetostriction is responsible for the transformer hum noise one hears near power
transformers. As the core of a transformer is magnetized one way and then in the
opposite direction under an alternating voltage, the alternating changes in the longitudinal strain vibrate the surrounding environment, air, oil, and so forth, and generate an
acoustic noise at twice the main frequency, or 120 Hz, and its harmonics. (Why?)
The magnetostrictive constant can be controlled by alloying metals. For example,
λsat along the easy direction for nickel is negative and for iron it is positive, but for
the alloy 85% Ni–15% Fe, it is zero. In certain magnetic materials, λ can be quite

large, greater than 10−4, which has opened up new areas of sensor applications based
on the magnetostriction effect. For example, it may be possible to develop torque
sensors for automotive steering applications by using Co-ferrite type magnetic materials5 (e.g., CoO–Fe2O3 or similar compounds) that have λsat of the order of 10−4.

8.5.5 DOMAIN WALL MOTION
The magnetization of a single ferromagnetic crystal involves the motions of domain
boundaries to allow the favorably oriented domains to grow at the expense of domains
with magnetizations directed away from the field (Figure 8.23). The motion of a
domain wall in a crystal is affected by crystal imperfections and impurities and is
not smooth. For example, in a 90° Bloch wall, the magnetization changes direction
by 90° across the boundary. Due to magnetostriction (Figure 8.27), there is a change
in the distortion of the lattice across the 90° boundary, which leads to a complicated
strain and hence stress distribution around this boundary. We also know that crystal
imperfections such as dislocations and point defects also have strain and stress distributions around them. Domain walls and crystal imperfections therefore interact
with each other. Dislocations are line defects that have a substantial volume of
strained lattice around them. Figure 8.28 visualizes a dislocation with tensile and
compressive strains around it and a domain wall that has a tensile strain on the side
of the dislocation. If the wall gets close to the dislocation, the tensile and compressive strains cancel, which results in an unstrained lattice and hence a lower strain
energy. This energetically favorable arrangement keeps the domain boundary close
to the dislocation. It now takes greater magnetic field to snap away the boundary
from the dislocation. Domain walls also interact with nonmagnetic impurities and
inclusions. For example, an inclusion that finds itself in a domain becomes magnetized and develops south and north poles, as shown in Figure 8.29a. If the domain
wall were to intersect the inclusion and if there were to be two neighboring domains
around the inclusion, as in Figure 8.29b, then the magnetostatic energy would be
lowered—energetically a favorable event. This reduction in magnetostatic potential
energy means that it now takes greater force to move the domain wall past the
impurity, as if the wall were “pinned” by the impurity.
The motion of a domain wall in a crystal is therefore not smooth but rather jerky.
The wall becomes pinned somewhere by a defect or an impurity and then needs a
greater applied field to break free. Once it snaps off, the domain wall is moved until

it is attracted by another type of imperfection, where it is held until the field increases
further to snap it away again. Each time the domain wall is snapped loose, lattice
vibrations are generated, which means loss of energy as heat. The whole domain
wall motion is nonreversible and involves energy losses as heat to the crystal.

8.5.6 POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS AND THE M VERSUS H BEHAVIOR
The majority of the magnetic materials used in engineering are polycrystalline and
therefore have a microstructure that consists of many grains of various sizes and
orientations depending on the preparation and thermal history of the component. In
an unmagnetized polycrystalline sample, each crystal grain will possess domains, as
depicted in Figure 8.30. The domain structure in each grain will depend on the size
and shape of the grain and, to some extent, on the magnetizations in neighboring
grains. Although very small grains, perhaps smaller than 0.1 μm, may be single
domains, in most cases the majority of the grains will have many domains. Overall,
the structure will possess no net magnetization, provided that it was not previously
subjected to an applied magnetic field. We can assume that the component was
heated to a temperature above the Curie point and then allowed to cool to room
temperature without an applied field.
Suppose that we start applying a very small external magnetic field (μoH) along
some direction, which we can arbitrarily label as +x. The domain walls within various grains begin to move small distances, and favorably oriented domains (those
with a component of M along +x) grow a little larger at the expense of those pointing away from the field, as indicated by point a in Figure 8.31. The domain walls
that are pinned by imperfections tend to bow out. There is a very small but net
magnetization along the field, as indicated by the Oa region in the magnetization
versus magnetizing field (M versus H) behavior in Figure 8.31. As we increase the
magnetizing field, the domain motions extend larger distances, as shown for point b

An example grain in the unmagnetized specimen is that at O. (a) Under very small fields, the domain boundary motion

in Figure 8.31, and walls encounter various obstacles such as crystal imperfections,
impurities, second phases, and so on, which tend to attract the walls and thereby
hinder their motions. A domain wall that is stuck (or pinned) at an imperfection at
a given field cannot move until the field increases sufficiently to provide the necessary force to snap the wall free, which then suddenly surges forward to the next
obstacle. As a wall suddenly snaps free and shoots forward to the next obstacle,
essentially two causes lead to heat generation. Sudden changes in the lattice distortion,

8.5

MAGNETIC DOMAINS: FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS

due to magnetostriction, create lattice waves that carry off some of the energy. Sudden changes in the magnetization induce eddy currents that dissipate energy via Joule
heating (domains have a finite electrical resistance). These processes involve energy
conversion to heat and are irreversible. Sudden jerks in the wall motions lead to
small jumps in the magnetization of the specimen as the magnetizing field is
increased; the phenomenon is known as the Barkhausen effect. If we could examine the magnetization precisely with a highly sensitive instrument, we would see
jumps in the M versus H behavior, as shown in the inset in Figure 8.31.
As we increase the field, magnetization continues to increase by jerky domain
wall motions that enlarge domains with favorably oriented magnetizations and shrink
away those with magnetizations pointing away from the applied field. Eventually
domain wall motions leave each crystal grain with a single domain and magnetization
in one of the easy directions, as indicated by point c in Figure 8.31. Although some
grains would be oriented to have the easy direction and hence M along the applied
field, the magnetization in many grains will be pointing at some angle to H as shown
for point c in Figure 8.31. From then until point d, the increase in the applied field
forces the magnetization in a grain, such as that at point c to rotate toward the direction of H. Eventually the applied field is sufficiently strong to align M along H, and
the specimen reaches saturation magnetization Msat, directed along H or +x, as at
point d in Figure 8.31.
If we were to decrease and remove the magnetizing field, the magnetization in
each grain would rotate to align parallel with the nearest easy direction in that grain.
Further, in some grains, additional small domains may develop that reduce the magnetization within that grain, as indicated at point e in Figure 8.31. This process, from
point d to point e, leaves the specimen with a permanent magnetization, called the
remanent or residual magnetization and denoted by Mr.
If we were now to apply a magnetizing field in the reverse direction −x, the
magnetization of the specimen, still along +x, would decrease and eventually, at a
sufficiently large applied field M would be zero and the sample would have been
totally demagnetized. This is shown as point f in Figure 8.31. The magnetizing field
Hc required to totally demagnetize the sample is called the coercivity or the coercive
field. Some authors and various data sheets define Hc as the intrinsic coercivity. It
represents the resistance of the sample to demagnetization. We should note that at
point f in Figure 8.31, the sample again has grains with many domains, which means
that during the demagnetization process, from point e to point f, new domains had
to be generated. The demagnetization process invariably involves the nucleation of
various domains at various crystal imperfections to cancel the overall magnetization.
The treatment of the nucleation of domains is beyond the scope of this book; we will
nonetheless, accept it as required process for the demagnetization of the crystal grains.
If we continue to increase the applied magnetic field along −x, as illustrated in
Figure 8.32a, the process from point f onward becomes similar to that described for
magnetization from point a to point d in Figure 8.31 along +x except that it is now
directed along −x. At point g, the sample reaches saturation magnetization along the
−x direction. The full M versus H behavior as the magnetizing field is cycled between
+x to −x has a closed loop shape, shown in Figure 8.32a, called the hysteresis loop.
We observe that in both +x and −x directions, the magnetization reaches saturation

Msat when H reaches Hsat, and on removing the applied field, the specimen retains
an amount of permanent magnetization, represented by points e and h and denoted
by Mr. The necessary applied field of magnitude Hc that is needed to demagnetize
the specimen is the coercivity (or coercive field), which is represented by points f
and i. The initial magnetization curve, Oabcd in Figure 8.31, which starts from an
unmagnetized state, is called the initial magnetization curve.
We can, of course, monitor the magnetic field B instead of M, as in Figure 8.32b,
where
B = μo M + μo H

[8.26]

which leads to a hysteresis loop in the B versus H behavior. The very slight increase
in B with H when M is in saturation is due to the permeability of free space (μoH).
The area enclosed within the B versus H hysteresis loop, shown as the hatched region
in Figure 8.32b, represents the energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle of applied
field variation. Notice that the magnetizing field Hc for M = 0 is different than H′c for
B = 0 in the material. We will call H′c the coercivity on the B–H loop.6 H′c is smaller
than Hc because we are trying to make B = 0 in Equation 8.26, and this occurs at
a finite (and negative) M, before we reach point f on path def in Figure 8.32a.
Suppose we do not take a magnetic material to saturation but still subject the
specimen to a cyclic applied field alternating between the +x and −x directions.
Then the hysteresis loop would be different than that when the sample is taken all
the way to saturation, as shown in Figure 8.33. The magnetic field in the material
does not reach Bsat (corresponding to Msat) but instead reaches some maximum value
Bm when the magnetizing field is Hm. There is still a hysteresis effect because the

Unfortunately there is no accepted consensus on the exact terminology for Hc and H′c, which adds to confusion.
Nonetheless, intrinsic coercivity Hc defined on the M–H curve seems a reasonable definition. Hci is also used
for Hc.

magnetization and demagnetization processes are nonreversible and do not retrace
each other. The shape of the hysteresis loop depends on the magnitude of the applied
field in addition to the material and sample shape and size. The area enclosed within
the loop is still the energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle of applied field
oscillation. The hysteresis loop taken to saturation, as in Figure 8.32a and b, is called
the saturation (major) hysteresis loop. It is apparent from Figure 8.33 that the
remanence and coercivity exhibited by the sample depend on the B–H loop. The
quoted values normally correspond to the saturation hysteresis loop.
Ferrimagnetic materials exhibit properties that closely resemble those of ferromagnetic materials. One can again identify distinct magnetic domains and domain
wall motions during magnetization and demagnetization that also lead to B–H hysteresis curves with the same characteristic parameters, namely, saturation magnetization (Msat and Bsat at Hsat), remanence (Mr and Br), coercivity (Hc), hysteresis loss,
and so on.

8.5.7 DEMAGNETIZATION
The B–H hysteresis curves, as in Figure 8.32b, that are commonly given for magnetic
materials represent B versus H behavior observed under repeated cycling. The applied
field intensity H is cycled back and forward between the −x and +x directions. If
we were to try and demagnetize a specimen with a remanent magnetization at point
e in Figure 8.34 by applying a reverse field intensity, then the magnetization would
move along from point e to point f. If at point f we were to suddenly switch off the
applied field, we would find that B does not actually remain zero but recovers along
f to point e′ and attains some value B′r. The main reason is that small domain wall
motions are reversible and as soon as the field is removed, there is some reversible
domain wall motion “bouncing back” the magnetization along f–e′. We can anticipate this recovery and remove the field intensity at some point f′ so that the sample
recovers along f ′O and the magnetization ends up being zero. However, to remove
the field intensity at point f′, we need to know not only the exact B–H behavior but
also the exact location of point f ′ (or the recovery behavior). The simplest method
to demagnetize the sample is first to cycle H with ample magnitude to reach saturation
and then to continue cycling H but with a gradually decreasing magnitude, as

depicted in Figure 8.35. As H is cycled with a decreasing magnitude, the sample
traces out smaller and smaller B–H loops until the B–H loops are so small that they
end up at the origin when H reaches zero. The demagnetization process in Figure
8.35 is commonly known as deperming. Undesirable magnetization of various magnetic devices such as recording heads is typically removed by this deperming process
(for example, a demagnetizing gun brought close to a magnetized recording head
implements deperming by applying a cycled H with decreasing magnitude).

EXAMPLE 8.5

ENERGY DISSIPATED PER UNIT VOLUME AND THE HYSTERESIS LOOP Consider a toroidal coil with an iron core that is energized from a voltage supply through a rheostat, as shown
in Figure 8.11. Suppose that by adjusting the rheostat we can adjust the current i supplied to
the coil and hence the magnetizing field H in the core material. H and i are simply related
by Ampere’s law. However, the magnetic field B in the core is determined by the B–H characteristics of the core material. From electromagnetism (see Example 8.2), we know that the
battery has to do work dEvol per unit volume of core material to increase the magnetic field
by dB, where
dEvol = H dB

where the integration limits are determined by the initial and final magnetic fields.
Equation 8.27 corresponds to the area between the B–H curve and the B axis between
B1 and B2. Suppose that we take the iron core in the toroid from point P on the hysteresis
curve to Q, as shown in Figure 8.36. This is a magnetization process for which energy is put
into the sample. The work done per unit volume from P to Q is the area PQRS, shown as

hatched. On returning the sample to the same initial magnetization (same magnetic field B
as we had at P), taking it from Q to S, energy is returned from the core into the electric
circuit. This energy per unit volume is the area QRS, shown as gray, and is less than PQRS
during magnetization. The difference is the energy dissipated in the sample as heat (moving
domain walls and so on) and corresponds to the hysteresis loop area PQS. Over one full cycle,
the energy dissipated per unit volume is the total hysteresis loop area.
The hysteresis loop and hence the energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle depend
not only on the core material but also on the magnitude of the magnetic field (Bm), as apparent in Figure 8.33. For example, for magnetic steels used in transformer cores, the hysteresis
power loss Ph per unit volume of core is empirically expressed in terms of the maximum
magnetic field Bm and the ac frequency f as7
Ph = K fBmn

[8.28]

where K is a constant that depends on the core material (typically, K = 150.7), f is the ac
frequency (Hz), Bm is the maximum magnetic field (T) in the core (assumed to be in the
range 0.1–1.5 T), and n = 1.6. According to Equation 8.28, the hysteresis loss can be decreased
by operating the transformer with a reduced magnetic field.

8.6 SOFT AND HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS
8.6.1 DEFINITIONS
Based on their B–H behavior, engineering materials are typically classified into soft
and hard magnetic materials. Their typical B–H hysteresis curves are shown in
Figure 8.37. Soft magnetic materials are easy to magnetize and demagnetize and hence
require relatively low magnetic field intensities. Put differently, their B–H loops are
narrow, as shown in Figure 8.37. The hysteresis loop has a small area, so the hysteresis power loss per cycle is small. Soft magnetic materials are typically suitable for
applications where repeated cycles of magnetization and demagnetization are involved,
as in electric motors, transformers, and inductors, where the magnetic field varies
cyclically. These applications also require low hysteresis losses, or small hysteresis
loop area. Electromagnetic relays that have to be turned on and off require the relay
iron to be magnetized and demagnetized and therefore need soft magnetic materials.
Hard magnetic materials, on the other hand, are difficult to magnetize and
demagnetize and hence require relatively large magnetic field intensities, as apparent

in Figure 8.37. Their B–H curves are broad and almost rectangular. They possess
relatively large coercivities, which means that they need large applied fields to be
demagnetized. The coercive field for hard materials can be millions of times greater
than those for soft magnetic materials. Their characteristics make hard magnetic
materials useful as permanent magnets in a variety of applications. It is also clear
that the magnetization can be switched from one very persistent direction to another
very persistent direction, from +Br to −Br, by a suitably large magnetizing field
intensity. As the coercivity is strong, both the states +Br and −Br persist until a
suitable (large) magnetic field intensity switches the field from one direction to the
other. It is apparent that hard magnetic materials can also be used in magnetic storage of digital data, where the states +Br and −Br can be made to represent 1 and 0
(or vice versa).

8.6.2 INITIAL AND MAXIMUM PERMEABILITY
It is useful to characterize the magnetization of a material by a relative permeability
μr, since this simplifies magnetic calculations. For example, inductance calculations
become straightforward if one could represent the magnetic material by μr alone. But
it is clear from Figure 8.38a that
μr =

μoH

is not even approximately constant because it depends on the applied field and the
magnetic history of the sample. Nonetheless, we still find it useful to specify a
relative permeability to compare various materials and even use it in various calculations. The definition μr = B∕(μoH) represents the slope of the straight line from
the origin O to the point P, as shown in Figure 8.38a. This is a maximum when the
line becomes a tangent to the B–H curve at P, as in the figure. Any other line from
O to the B–H curve that is not a tangent does not yield a maximum relative permeability (the mathematical proof is left to the reader, though the argument is intuitively
acceptable from the figure). The maximum relative permeability, as defined in
Figure 8.38a, is denoted by μr,max and serves as a useful magnetic parameter.

The point P in Figure 8.38a that defines the maximum permeability corresponds to
what is called the “knee” of the B–H curve. Many transformers are designed to
operate with the maximum magnetic field in the core reaching this knee point. For
pure iron, μr,max is less than 104, but for certain soft magnetic materials such as
supermalloys (a nickel–iron alloy), the values of μr,max can be as high as 106.
Initial relative permeability, denoted as μri, represents the initial slope of the
initial B versus H curve as the material is first magnetized from an unmagnetized
state, as illustrated in Figure 8.38b. This definition is useful for soft magnetic materials that are employed at very low magnetic fields (e.g., small signals in electronics
and communications engineering). In practice, weak applied magnetic fields where
μri is useful are typically less than 10−4 T. In contrast, μr,max is useful when the
magnetic field in the material is not far removed from saturation. Initial relative
permeability of a magnetically soft material can vary by orders of magnitude. For
example, μri for iron is 150, whereas for supernumetal-200, a commercial alloy of
nickel and iron, it is about 2 × 105.

8.7

SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALS:
EXAMPLES AND USES

Table 8.5 identifies what properties are desirable in soft magnetic materials and also
lists some typical examples with various applications. An ideal soft magnetic material would have zero coercivity (Hc), a very large saturation magnetization (Bsat), zero
remanent magnetization (Br), zero hysteresis loss, and very large μr,max and μri. A
number of example materials, from pure iron to ferrites, which are ferrimagnetic, are
listed in Table 8.5. Pure iron, although soft, is normally not used in electric machines
(except in a few specific relay-type applications) because its good conductivity
allows large eddy currents to be induced under varying fields. Induced eddy currents
in the iron lead to Joule losses (RI2), which are undesirable. The addition of a few
percentages of silicon to iron (silicon–iron), known typically as silicon–steels,
increases the resistivity and hence reduces the eddy current losses. Silicon–iron is
widely used in power transformers and electric machinery.

The nickel–iron alloys with compositions around 77% Ni–23% Fe constitute an
important class of soft magnetic materials with low coercivity, low hysteresis losses,
and high permeabilities (μri and μr,max). High μri makes these alloys particularly
useful in low magnetic field applications that are typically found in high-frequency
work in electronics (e.g., audio and wide-band transformers). They have found many
engineering uses in sensitive relays, pulse and wide-band transformers, current
transformers, magnetic recording heads, magnetic shielding, and so forth. Alloying
iron with nickel increases the resistivity and hence reduces eddy current losses. The
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is least at these nickel compositions, which
leads to easier domain wall motions and hence smaller hysteresis losses. There are
a number of commercial nickel–iron alloys whose application depends on the exact
composition (which may also have a few percentages of Mo, Cu, or Cr) and the
method of preparation (e.g., mechanical rolling). For example, supermalloy
(79% Ni–16% Fe–5% Co) has μri ≈ 105, compared with commercial grade iron,
which has μri less than 103.

8 .7

SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALS: EXAMPLES AND USES

805

Amorphous magnetic metals, as the name implies, have no crystal structure
(they only have short-range order) and consequently possess no crystalline imperfections such as grain boundaries and dislocations. They are prepared by rapid
solidification of the melt by using special techniques such as melt spinning (as
described in Chapter 1). Typically they are thin ribbons by virtue of their preparation method. Since they have no crystal structure, they also have no magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, which means that all directions are easy. The absence of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy and usual crystalline defects which normally impede
domain wall motions, leads to low coercivities and hence to soft magnetic properties. The coercivity, however, is not zero inasmuch as there is still some magnetic
anisotropy due to the directional nature of the strains frozen in the metal during
rapid solidification. By virtue of their disordered structure, these metallic glasses
also have higher resistivities and hence they have smaller eddy current losses.
Although they are ideally suited for various transformer and electric machinery
applications, their limited size and shape, at present, prevent their use in power
applications.
Ferrites are ferrimagnetic materials that are typically oxides of mixed transition
metals, one of which is iron. For example, Mn ferrite is MnFe2O4 and MgZn ferrite
is Mn1−xZnxFe2O4. They are normally insulators and therefore do not suffer from
eddy current losses. They are ideal as magnetic materials for high-frequency work
where eddy current losses would prevent the use of any material with a reasonable
conductivity. Although they can have high initial permeabilities and low losses, they
do not possess as large saturation magnetizations as ferromagnets, and further, their
useful temperature range (determined by the Curie temperature) is lower. There are
many types of commercial ferrites available depending on the application, tolerable
losses, and the required upper frequency of operation. MnZn ferrites, for example,
have high initial permeabilities (e.g., 2 × 103) but are only useful up to about 1 MHz,
whereas NiZn ferrites have lower initial permeability (e.g., 102) but can be used up
to 200 MHz. Generally, the initial permeability in the high-frequency region decreases
with frequency.
Garnets are ferrimagnetic materials that are typically used at the highest frequencies that cover the microwave range (1–300 GHz). The yttrium iron garnet, YIG,
which is Y3Fe5O12, is one of the simplest garnets with a very low hysteresis loss at
microwave frequencies. Garnets have excellent dielectric properties with high resistivities and hence low losses. The main disadvantages are the low saturation magnetization, which is 0.18 T for YIG, and low Curie temperature, 280 °C for YIG.
The compositions of garnets depend on the properties required for the particular
microwave application. For example, Y2.1Gd0.98Fe5O12 is a garnet that is used in
X-band (8–12 GHz) three-port circulators handling high microwave powers (e.g.,
peak power 200 kW and average power 200 W).

AN INDUCTOR WITH A FERRITE CORE Consider a toroidal coil with a ferrite core. Suppose
that the coil has 200 turns and is used in HF work with small signals. The mean diameter of
the toroid is 2.5 cm and the core diameter is 0.5 cm. If the core is a MnZn ferrite with
μr = 2 × 103, what is the approximate inductance of the coil?

Had the core been air, the inductance would have been 1.26 × 10−5 H or 12.6 μH. The
main assumption is that B is uniform in the core, and this will be only so if the diameter of
the toroid (2.5 cm) is much greater than the core diameter (0.5 cm). Here this ratio is 5 and
the calculation is only approximate.

HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS:

An ideal hard magnetic material, as summarized in Table 8.6, has very large coercivity and remanent magnetic field. Further, since they are used as permanent magnets,
the energy stored per unit volume in the external magnetic field should be as large
as possible since this is the energy available to do work. This energy density (J m−3)

in the external field depends on the maximum value of the product BH in the second
quadrant of the B–H characteristics and is denoted as (BH)max. It corresponds to the
largest rectangular area that fits the B–H curve in the second quadrant, as shown in
Figure 8.39.
When the size of a ferromagnetic sample falls below a certain critical dimension,
of the order of 0.1 μm for cobalt, the whole sample becomes a single domain, as
depicted in Figure 8.40, because the cost of energy in generating a domain wall is
too high compared with the reduction in external magnetostatic energy. These small
particle-like pieces of magnets are called single domain fine particles. Their magnetic properties depend not only on the crystal structure of the particle but also on
the shape of the particle because different shapes give rise to different external
magnetic fields. For a spherical iron particle, the magnetization M will be in an easy
direction, for example, along [100] taken along +z. To reverse the magnetization
from +z to −z by an applied field, we have to rotate the spins around past the hard
direction, as shown in Figure 8.40, since we cannot generate reverse domains (or
move domain walls). The rotation of magnetization involves substantial work due to
the magnetocrystalline anisotropic energy, and the result is high coercivity. The
higher the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, the greater the coercivity. The energy
involved in creating a domain wall increases with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy. The critical size below which a particle becomes a single domain therefore
increases with the crystalline anisotropy. Barium ferrite crystals have the hexagonal
structure and hence have a high degree of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Critical
size for single domain barium ferrite particles is about 1–1.5 μm, and the coercivity
μoHc of small particles can be as high as 0.3 T, compared with values 0.02–0.1 T
in multidomain barium ferrite pieces.
Particles that are not spherical may even have higher coercivity as a result of
shape anisotropy. Consider an ellipsoid (elongated) fine particle, shown in Figure 8.41a.
If the magnetization M is along the long axis (along z), then the potential energy in
the external magnetic field is less than if M were along the minor axis (along y), as
compared in Figure 8.41a and b. Thus, we have to do work to rotate M from the
long to the short axis, or from Figure 8.41a to b. An elongated fine particle therefore
has its magnetization along its length, and the effect is called shape anisotropy. If
we have to reverse the magnetization from +z to −z by applying a reverse field, then

we can only do so by rotating the magnetization, as shown in Figure 8.41a to c. M
has to be rotated around through the minor axis, and this involves substantial work.
Thus the coercivity is high. In general, the greater the elongation of the particle with
respect to its width, the higher the coercivity. Small spherical Fe–Cr–Co particles
have a coercivity μoHc at most 0.02 T, but elongated and aligned particles can have
a coercivity as high as 0.075 T due to shape anisotropy.
High coercivity magnets can be fabricated by having elongated fine particles
dispersed by precipitation in a structure. Fine particles will be single domains. Alnico
is a popular permanent magnet material that is an alloy of the metals Al, Ni, Co,
and Fe (hence the name). Its microstructure consists of fine elongated Fe–Co rich
particles, called the α′-phase, dispersed in a matrix that is Ni–Al rich and called the
α-phase. The structure is obtained by an appropriate heat treatment that allows fine α′
particles to precipitate out from a solid solution of the alloy. The α′ particles are

8.8

HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS: EXAMPLES AND USES

809

strongly magnetic, whereas the α-phase matrix is weakly magnetic. When the heat
treatment is carried out in the presence of a strong applied magnetic field, the α′
particles that are formed have their elongations (or lengths) and hence their magnetizations along the applied field. The demagnetization process requires the rotations
of the magnetizations in single domain elongated α′ particles, which is a difficult
process (shape anisotropy), and hence the coercivity is high. The main drawback of
the Alnico magnet is that the alloy is mechanically hard and brittle and cannot be
shaped except by casting or sintering before heat treatment. There are, however, other
alloy permanent magnets that can be machined.
A variety of permanent magnets are made by compacting high-coercivity particles by using powder metallurgy (e.g., powder pressing or sintering). The particles
are magnetically hard because they are sufficiently small for each to be of single
domain or they possess substantial shape anisotropy (elongated particles may be
ferromagnetic alloys, e.g., Fe–Co, or various hard ferrites). These are generically
called powdered solid permanent magnets. An important class is the ceramic magnets
that are made by compacting barium ferrite, BaFe12O9, or strontium ferrite, SrFe12O9,
particles. The barium ferrite has the hexagonal crystal structure with a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which means that barium ferrite particles have high coercivity.
The ceramic magnet is typically formed by wet pressing ferrite powder in the presence of a magnetizing field, which allows the easy directions of the particles to be
aligned, and then drying and carefully sintering the ceramic. They are used in many
low-cost applications.
Rare earth cobalt permanent magnets based on samarium–cobalt (Sm–Co)
alloys have very high (BH)max values and are widely used in many applications
such as dc motors, stepper and servo motors, traveling wave tubes, klystrons, and

One important application of permanent
magnets is in small dc motors. Toothbrushes
that operate from batteries use dc motors
with strong permanent magnets to get the
required torque to drive the brushes.

gyroscopes. The intermetallic compound SmCo5 has a hexagonal crystal structure
with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy and hence high coercivity. The SmCo5
powder is pressed in the presence of an applied magnetic field to align the magnetizations of the particles. This is followed by careful sintering to produce a
solid powder magnet. The Sm2Co15 magnets are more recent and have particularly
high values of (BH)max up to about 250 kJ m−3. Sm2Co15 is actually a generic
name and the alloy may contain other transition metals substituting for some of
the Co atoms.
The more recent neodymium–iron–boron, NdFeB, powdered solid magnets can
have very large (HB)max values up to about 350 kJ m−3. The tetragonal crystal structure has the easy direction along the long axis and possesses high magnetocrystalline
anisotropic energy. This means that we need a substantial amount of work to rotate
the magnetization around through the hard direction, and hence the coercivity is also
high. The main drawback is the lower Curie temperature, typically around 300 °C,
whereas for Alnico and rare earth cobalt magnets, the Curie temperatures are above
700 °C. Another method of preparing NdFeB magnets is by the recrystallization of
amorphous NdFeB at an elevated temperature in an applied field. The grains in the
recrystallized structure are sufficiently small to be single domain grains and therefore
possess high coercivity.
EXAMPLE 8.7

(BH)max FOR A PERMANENT MAGNET Consider the permanent magnet in Figure 8.42.
There is a small air gap of length ℓg where there is an external magnetic field that is available
to do work. For example, if we were to insert an appropriate coil in the gap and pass a current through the coil, it would rotate as in a moving coil panel meter. Show that the magnetic
energy per unit volume stored in the gap is proportional to the maximum value of BH. How
does (BH)max vary with the magnetizing field?
SOLUTION

Let ℓm be the mean length of the magnet from one end to the other, as shown in Figure 8.42.
We assume that the cross-sectional area A is constant throughout. There are no windings
around the magnet and no current, I = 0. Ampere’s law for H involves integrating H along
a closed path or around the mean path length ℓm + ℓg. Suppose that Hm and Hg are the magnetic field intensities in the permanent magnet and in the gap, respectively. Then H dℓ integrated around ℓm + ℓg is
∮

H dℓ = Hm ℓm + Hgℓg = 0

Equation 8.29 is a relationship between Bg in the gap and Hm in the magnet. In addition,
we have the B–H relationship for the magnetic material itself between the magnetic field Bm
and intensity Hm in the magnet, that is,
Bm = f (Hm)

[8.30]

The magnetic flux in the magnet and in the air gap must be continuous. Since we
assumed a uniform cross-sectional area, the continuity of flux across the air gap implies that
Bm = Bg. Thus we need to equate Equation 8.29 to Equation 8.30. Equation 8.29 is a straight
line with a negative slope in a Bg versus Hm plot, as shown in Figure 8.43a. Equation 8.30
is, of course, the B–H characteristics of the material. The two intersect at point P, as shown
in Figure 8.43a, where Bg = Bm = B′m and Hm = H′m.
We know that there is magnetic energy in the air gap given by

(BH)max, when the magnetic field is B*m and the field intensity is H*
m. We can appropriately
choose the air-gap size to operate at these values, in which case we will be only limited by
the (BH)max available for that magnetic material. It is clear that (BH)max is a good figure of
merit for comparing hard magnetic materials. According to Table 8.6, we can extract four to
five times more work from a rare earth cobalt magnet than from an Alnico magnet of the
same size if we were not limited by economics and weight. It should be mentioned that
Equation 8.31 is only approximate as it neglects all fringe fields.

8.9

ENERGY BAND DIAGRAMS AND MAGNETISM

8.9.1 PAULI SPIN PARAMAGNETISM
Consider a paramagnetic metal such as sodium. The paramagnetism arises from the
alignment of the spins of conduction electrons with the applied magnetic field. A
conduction electron in a metal has an extended wave function and does not orbit any
particular metal ion. The conduction electron’s magnetic moment arises from the
electron spin alone, and μspin is in the opposite direction to the spin; μspin can be either
up (ms = −12 ) or down (ms = +12 ). In the absence of a magnetic field, the energies
of magnetic moment up and down states (or wavefunctions) are the same and there
are as many electrons with magnetic moment up as there are with magnetic moment
down. Figure 8.44a shows the density of states (number of states per unit energy per
unit volume) for states with magnetic moment up (↑), denoted as g↑(E), and for states
with magnetic moment down (↓), denoted as g↓(E). Both states have the same energy
and both are equally occupied. All energy levels up to the Fermi energy EF are occupied as shown in Figure 8.44a. Effectively we are viewing the energy band of the
metal as two subbands corresponding to magnetic moment up and down bands. The
bands overlap in the absence of a field and are indistinguishable.
Consider what happens in the presence of an applied field Bo along the z direction. If a conduction electron’s magnetic moment μz is along the field (aligned with

the field), then it has a lower potential energy. Thus, those electron wavefunctions
with a magnetic moment up have lower energy, whereas those wavefunctions with
a magnetic moment down have higher energy. In the presence of a field Bo, therefore, all states with magnetic moment up, and hence g↑(E), are lowered in energy
by βBo where β is the Bohr magneton. All states with magnetic moment down, and
hence g↓(E), are raised by βBo. Both shifts are shown in Figure 8.44b. Those electrons with magnetic moment down near EF in the g↓(E) band can now find lower
energy states in the g↑(E) band and hence flip their spins and transfer to the g↑(E)
band. There are now more electrons in states with magnetic moment up in the g↑(E)
band than in the g↓(E) band. When averaged over all conduction electrons there is
now a net magnetic moment per conduction electron along the z direction or the
applied field.
To find the net magnetic moment per conduction electron we have to find how
many electrons transfer from the g↓(E) band to the g↑(E) band. The energy separation
ΔE between the magnetic moment down and up states is 2βBo. All electrons, ne per
unit volume, in the g↓(E) band around EF within an energy range 12 ΔE transfer to
the g↑(E) band. ΔE is small, so ne is approximately g↓ (EF ) ( 21 ΔE) or 12 g(EF ) ( 21 ΔE)
because g(EF) includes states with spin up and down, that is, 12 g(EF ) = g↓ (EF ). The
magnetic moment down band decreases by ne and the magnetic moment up band
increases by ne and the net magnetic moment per unit volume is
M ≈ 2ne μz = 2[ 12 g(EF )( 21 ΔE)]β
= 2[ 12 g(EF )( 212βBo )]β = β2g(EF )Bo

Using Bo = μoH and the definition χm = M∕H, the paramagnetic susceptibility is
χpara ≈ μo β2g(EF)

[8.32]

We see that the density of states at the Fermi level determines the susceptibility.

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

We need to subtract the diamagnetic from the calculated paramagnetic susceptibility to obtain
the net susceptibility, which would decrease the calculated value slightly. Nonetheless, given the
approximate nature of the theory, the calculated value is not far out from the measured value.

8.9.2 ENERGY BAND MODEL OF FERROMAGNETISM
The energy band model of paramagnetism can be extended to explain ferromagnetism. Once we start using the energy band model, we are essentially assigning all
the valence (outer shell) electrons of the atoms to a collective sharing among all the
atoms; they no longer belong to their individual parents. These valence electrons
now belong to the whole crystal. (The model is also known as the itinerant electron
model.)
Recall that in a ferromagnetic crystal there is an internal magnetization, even in
the absence of an applied field, due to a net number of unpaired spins; that is, overall, the crystal has more electrons with spins up than with spins down. The reason
is the exchange energy, which causes the spin magnetic moments of two electrons
to line up parallel to each other so that their energy is lowered in much the same
way as Hund’s rule works within an atom. In magnetic metals such as Fe, Ni, and
Co, there are two bands of interest, the s-band and the d-band. The two bands overlap but the s-band is much wider. We can represent the density of states for magnetic
moment up and magnetic moment down states separately. Consider the d-band. The
density of states g↑(E) for magnetic moment up states is lowered by ΔE with respect
to the density of states g↓(E) for magnetic moment down states due to the exchange
energy as shown in Figure 8.45a. The energy lowering ΔE for the s-band can be
neglected as in Figure 8.45b. All the states up to the Fermi energy are occupied. For
Fe, the d-band magnetic moment up states are filled almost to the top of the band
(this band is 96 percent full), and magnetic moment down states are filled roughly
halfway. Thus, there are many more electrons with moments up than moments down;
put differently there are many electrons that have aligned their spins. The spin magnetic moment alignment of electrons is exactly what is needed to generate a net
magnetization. (In some books, the spin magnetic moment down band is sketched
lower than the spin magnetic moment up band in contrast to Figure 8.45a. Both
sketches are correct since both would also result in a net number of electrons having

their spins in parallel, and hence a net magnetization within the crystal. Another way
to look at it is to realize that there are two bands: one band for the “majority of
spins,” and another band for the “minority spins.”)
The s-band is filled up to EF, and there are almost equal numbers of electrons
with up and down moments in this band. The ferromagnetic effect arises from the
behavior of electrons mainly in the d-band. Electrical conduction, on the other hand,
is determined by electrons in the s-band. The reason is that the s-band is very wide
compared with the d-band, and the electron effective mass in the s-band is very
small. Thus, electrons have a much higher mobility in the s-band than in the d-band.
When an s-electron is scattered (by phonons, impurities, defects, etc.) into the d-band,
it does not make any significant contribution to conduction because the drift mobility is very small in this band. The spin of the electron cannot be flipped easily in a
scattering process. An s-electron with its moment down can be easily scattered into
the empty states in the corresponding moment-down d-band (there are many empty
states at EF), but the moment-up electron has no states in the moment-up d-band
into which it can be scattered. Conduction occurs by moment-up electrons; these are
the favored electrons for conduction.
The band model is particularly useful in explaining the noninteger number of Bohr
magnetons that give rise to the ferromagnetism. The isolated Fe atom has six 3d and
two 4s electrons or 8 valence electrons. These electrons in the crystal become shared
by all the atoms. If N is the number of atoms per unit volume, then one unit volume
of crystal has 8N valence electrons. 8N electrons enter the s and d bands, filling states
starting from the lowest energy.8 The exact distribution of electrons depends on how
many states are available at each energy as electrons fill the bands. We simply summarize the results of the filling process that is shown in Figure 8.45 for Fe:
0.3N electrons in the moment-up s-band (N states available)
0.3N electrons in the moment-down s-band (N states available)
4.8N electrons in the moment-up d-band (5N states available)
2.6N electrons in the moment-down d-band (5N states available)
To find how many electrons have parallel spin magnetic moments, we simply
sum the above, which is 2.2N moment-up electrons per unit volume or 2.2N Bohr
magnetons per unit volume, or 2.2 Bohr magnetons per atom. The saturation magnetization Msat is then (2.2N)β or 2.2 T. There is therefore a natural explanation for
a noninteger number of spins per atom in the band model of ferromagnetism.

ANISOTROPIC AND GIANT MAGNETORESISTANCE

In general, magnetoresistance refers to the change in the resistance of a material
(any material) when it is placed in a magnetic field. When a nonmagnetic metal such
as copper is placed in a magnetic field, the change in its resistivity, and hence the
sample resistance, is so small that it has no real practical use. When a magnetic

metal, such as iron, is placed in a magnetic field, the change in the resistivity depends
on the direction of the current flow with respect to the magnetic field. The resistivity ρ∕∕ for current flow parallel to the magnetic field decreases, and the resistivity
ρ⊥ , perpendicular to the field, increases by roughly the same amount. The change
in the resistivity due to the applied magnetic field is anisotropic (depends on the
direction) and is called anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The change in resistivity is limited to a few percent, but, nonetheless, is still useful. The physical origin
of this phenomenon is based on the applied field being able to tilt the orbital angular momenta of the 3d electrons as shown in Figure 8.46a. The field rotates the 3d
orbitals, which changes the scattering of the conduction electrons according to their
direction of travel; hence ρ∕∕ and ρ⊥ are different, as shown in Figure 8.46b.
On the other hand, a very large magnetoresistance, called giant magnetoresistance (GMR), has been observed in certain special multilayer structures, which
exhibit substantial changes in the resistance (e.g., more than 10 percent) when a
magnetic field is applied.9 The discovery of GMR in 1988 was one of the most

GMR was discovered in the late 1980s by Peter Grünberg (Julich, Germany), and Albert Fert (University of
Paris-Sud) and their coworkers. Magnetoresistance itself, however, has been well known, and dates back to Lord
Kelvin’s experiments in 1857.

important developments in magnetic devices. GMR based devices are widely used
in the read heads of hard disk drives, and also in various magnetic field sensors.
The special multilayer structure in its simplest form has two ferromagnetic layers
(such as Fe or Co or their alloys, etc.) separated by a nonmagnetic transition metal
layer (such as Cu), called the spacer, as shown in Figure 8.47a. The magnetic layers
are thin (less than 10 nm), and the nonmagnetic layer is even thinner. The magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers are not random; they depend on the thickness
of the spacer because the two layers are “coupled” indirectly through this thin
spacer.10 In the absence of an external field, two magnetic layers are coupled in such
a way that their magnetizations are antiparallel or in opposite directions; this arrangement is also called an antiferromagnetically coupled configuration. We will use the
notation FNA to represent the antiparallel configuration, where N stands for the
nonmagnetic metal.
We can apply an external magnetic field to one of the layers and rotate its
magnetization so that the two magnetizations are now in parallel as in Figure 8.47c.
This parallel configuration is frequently called ferromagnetically coupled layers
and is denoted as FNF. The two structures have a giant difference in their resistances, hence the term giant magnetoresistance. The resistance of the antiparallel
FNA in Figure 8.47b structure is much higher than that of the parallel structure
FNF in Figure 8.47c.
The current flow through this multilayer structure (whether along or perpendicular
to the layers) will involve electrons crossing from one layer to another, passing through

The physics of the coupling process between the two magnetic layers is an indirect exchange interaction, the
details of which are not needed to understand the basics of the GMR phenomenon.

the interfaces. Recall that it is the electrons around the Fermi energy that are involved
in the conduction and that their mean speed is orders of magnitude larger than the drift
velocity. The electron trajectories are therefore not parallel to the current flow (and
should not be confused with current flow lines).
Consider the antiparallel FNA structure. The magnetic moment up electron in
the first magnetic layer is the favored conduction electron; that is, it suffers very
little scattering. However, when this moment-up electron arrives at the A layer in
which the magnetization is reversed, it finds itself with the wrong spin or wrong
moment. It is now an unfavored electron and is subject to scattering. Thus, the
moment-up electron suffers scattering not only in the bulk of A but, more significantly, as it crosses the N-layer into the A-layer, that is, at the interface as in Figure 8.47b. The antiparallel FNA structure therefore has a high resistance, denoted
as RAP. In contrast, when the magnetizations are parallel, the moment-up electron is
the favored electron in both the layers and experiences very little scattering. The
resistance RP of this parallel (FNF) structure is smaller than RAP (RP < RAP). The
difference in the resistances RP and RAP in this simple trilayer is roughly 10 percent
or less. But, in multilayered structures, which have a series of alternating magnetic
and nonmagnetic layers (e.g., 50 or more magnetic and nonmagnetic alternating layers as in FNANFANFA . . .), the change in the resistance can be impressively large,
exceeding 100 percent at low temperature and 60–80 percent at room temperature.
The GMR effect is often measured by quoting the change in the resistance with
respect to RP,

Further, the magnetoresistance effect can be measured either by passing a current
that flows in the plane of the layers or perpendicular to the plane. Most experiments
use the first one, in what is known as current in plane (CIP) measurements; but
the biggest change, however, is observed for currents perpendicular to the plane of
the layers. Table 8.7 summarizes typically reported ΔR∕RP values for the GMR effect
in simple trilayers and multilayers.

the minimum for θ = 0 (FNF) and the maximum for θ = 180° (FNA) as shown in
Figure 8.48. The fractional change in the resistance depends on θ as

As expected, the change is maximum when θ = 180°.
One of the best applications of GMR is in a spin valve, in which the current
flow is controlled by an external applied magnetic field. Stated differently, the resistance of the valve is controlled by an applied field. Figure 8.49a shows one possible
simple spin valve structure. The magnetization of the Co magnetic layer is fixed,
that is, pinned, by having this layer next to an antiferromagnetic layer, called the
pinning layer. The exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the
antiferromagnetic CoMn layer effectively pins the direction of the Co layer; it takes
an enormous field to change the magnetization of the Co layer. A Cu spacer layer
separates the Co and the next magnetic FeNi layer. The FeNi layer is called the free

layer because its magnetization can be changed by an external magnetic field. Normally, in the absence of a field, the magnetization of the FeNi layer is antiparallel
to the Co layer, and the structure has a high resistance RAP. An applied external field
Bo = μoH can rotate the FeNi layer’s magnetization and can easily align FeNi’s
magnetization fully in parallel with that of Co so that the resistance becomes minimum, i.e., RP as in Figure 8.49b. It is clear that the external field can be used to
control the flow of current through this structure. (The name spin valve reflects the
fact that the valve operation relies on the spin of the electrons.) The free layer should
be relatively soft to be able to respond to the applied field, whereas the pinned layer
should have sufficient coercivity not to lose its magnetization. Figure 8.49c shows
a typical magnetoresistance versus applied field characteristics for one particular type
of spin valve. The spin valve exhibits hysteresis; that is, the signal ΔR versus H depends
on the direction of magnetization as shown in the figure.

MAGNETIC RECORDING MATERIALS

8.11.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETIC RECORDING
Outside electric machinery (mainly rotating machines and transformers), magnetic
materials are most widely used in magnetic recording media to store information in
digital form. The deep disappointment of accidentally losing valuable stored information on the hard drive of one’s computer is well known to most computer users.
Magnetic materials in magnetic recording essentially fall into three categories: those
used in magnetic heads to write (record), those used in read sensors, and those used
in magnetic media in which the information is stored either permanently or until the
next write requirement.
As a very simple example, consider magnetic recording of digital data (1s and 0s)
on a magnetic disk in a hard disk drive (HDD), as shown schematically in Figure 8.50.11
The information storage medium, that is the recording medium, is a thin film of
magnetic material coated, for example, by sputtering, on a disk substrate, which
rotates inside the hard drive. The substrate is called the platter. The information is
recorded as magnetization patterns on this thin-film magnetic medium. The digital
information is converted into current pulses that flow into a miniature electromagnet
write element with a very small air gap. This gapped core electromagnet is called
the inductive write head or element. The current modulates the magnetic field
intensity in the core of the electromagnet and hence the field in the gap and around
it. The recording of information is achieved by the fringing magnetic field around
the gap region, magnetizing the magnetic medium passing under the head at a constant speed. As the fringing field changes according to the current signal, so does
the magnetization of the regions that pass under the write head. Thus, the electrical
signal is stored as a spatial magnetic pattern in the magnetic film in circular tracks.
The fringing fields of the write head modulate the magnetization in the thin magnetic film in the direction of motion; that is, in a circular path in a disc medium.

turns than two.

This type of magnetic information storage is called longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR).
The information that is written in the thin film as different orientations of magnetization is sensed by a read element, such as a giant magneto resistance (GMR)
sensor. Figure 8.51a shows how an inductive head and a GMR sensor are used to
write and read the magnetic information in the thin film. Both the write and the read
heads are in a single compact assembly that moves radially across the rotating disk

to write or read the information into tracks, called magnetic bit tracks, on the
magnetic medium as shown in Figure 8.50. The read-write head is on an air bearing
and the head to thin magnetic film separation is roughly 10 nm or less. GMR sensor
has a width that is something like 50 nm or less (∼1000 times thinner than the human
hair) so that we can squeeze more information into a given area on the magnetic
storage medium.
The inductive write head is normally a thin-film head, which has a very small
width as shown in Figure 8.51b and c. Consequently, the information can be written
into a very small area on the magnetic storage medium. The write head shown in
Figure 8.51b and c are fabricated from films of various ferromagnetic metals or ferrite alloys that have sufficiently small eddy current losses to be useable at high
frequencies. The head is manufactured by using typical thin film deposition techniques. The magnetic core is in the form of a thin film whose thickness is a few
microns and whose width determines the track width. The gap at the end of the core
has the same width as the core, but its spacing is very small (e.g., 100 nm) and
generates the necessary fringing field. A spiral-type coil made by depositing a nonmagnetic metal thin film threads the core. The magnetic core is like a U-shaped core
that is threaded by the metal strips of the coil. If the core is a metallic material, the
coil metal is appropriately insulated from it by thin films of insulation. The width
w of the bit-track is determined by the width of the write head in Figure 8.51b, and
is typically 100 nm or less.
The resistance of the GMR sensor depends on the external magnetic field, as
explained in Section 8.10. In this case, the field that influences the GMR sensor
comes from that of the magnetized patch of the disk that is under the GMR sensor.
The principle of the GMR is shown in Figure 8.49. The GMR sensor is a multilayered thin-film device whose resistance changes by roughly 10 percent or so in
response to an applied field. This change in the resistance generates the read signal.
The voltage from the sensor is maximum on locations on the film where magnetic
field changes sharply (dB∕dx is largest) and this corresponds to the transition region
from one-bit to the next. Normally a constant current is passed through the GMR
sensor, and the read signal is the voltage variation across the sensor; this voltage is
due to the resistance variation induced by the field from the magnetization pattern
under the sensor. Modern GMR sensors are operated in the current perpendicular

to the plane (CPP) mode because the current is passed perpendicular to the thin-film
layers in the GMR device (Figure 8.47).
In perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR), the stored information in the
magnetic film corresponds to magnetization directions that are perpendicular to the
film surface and the disk velocity, as shown in Figure 8.52; induced M is either up
or down. The easy direction of the grains are also perpendicular. More bits can be
packed to a given surface area, for reasons explained below, and many recent magnetic HDDs use this technology. The write operation in this case is distinctly different than that in longitudinal storage. There is an inductive write head with a narrow
“write pole” that brings the magnetic flux onto the film.
The magnetic thin film has a magnetically soft underlayer (SUL) that can be
easily magnetized. Remember also that magnetic flux prefers to flow through high
permeability regions in a medium. Thus, the flux flows from the write pole to the
underlayer and then to the return pole, which has a large cross sectional area as
shown in Figure 8.52.12 It is clear that the magnetic field lines pass through the
whole film perpendicularly, and the write operation does not depend on the fringe
field; a distinct advantage. The magnetizing field is strong under the write pole where
the cross sectional area is small, but it is weak under the return pole. The strong
field at the write pole is able to magnetize the thin film and write the information,
but the weak field under the return pole cannot erase this magnetization.
The magnetic thin film for storage is usually a heterogeneous granular medium.
The thin film has small crystalline grains and a region between the grains that is
nonmagnetic as shown in Figure 8.53a. For example, the crystalline grains could be
CoCrPt and the intergrain region may be an amorphous oxide such as SiO2 or a
mixture of SiO2–TiO2. Notice that the information boundary between the patches is
rugged because it follows the grain boundaries. If we did not have a magnetic insulation (a nonmagnetic medium) between the grains, then the exchange interaction
between the atoms in two neighboring grains would force the two grains to align
their magnetizations; we would not be able to magnetize a small patch on the track.
The nonmagnetic intergrain region is essential.
12

823

To understand the true function of the soft underlayer, we need to go into the fact that the write pole (say
N at one instant) sees an induced opposite image pole (S) in the underlayer in the same way a positive charge
+Q on an infinite dielectric medium sees an opposite image charge −Q within the dielectric. The field lines flow
+Q to −Q. It is clear though the field from the write pole cuts through the magnetic film.

How small can we make one-bit patch (the magnetized region for one bit) in
Figure 8.53a to store as much information as possible? Consider longitudinal recording. Let λ be the length of a one-bit patch, t be the thickness of the film and w be
the track width in which information is stored as in Figure 8.53b. The volume of
one-bit is λwt. Clearly, we would like λw to be as small as possible to increase the
storage capacity. One possibility is to reduce the number of grains in the one-bit
volume and hence the patch area. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a granular
magnetic recording medium depends on the number of grains (domains) N in the
one-bit volume (Figure 8.53a). The more grains, the higher the signal is, that is
the signal is proportional to N. The noise depends on how many grains would have
the wrong magnetization and is proportional to13 √N. In terms of commonly used
decibels (dB), this is
SNRgrain ≈ 20 log √N = 10 logN

[8.35]

A 20 dB SNR implies that a bit-volume should have 100 grains, which we can
take very roughly as the number of minimum grains Nmin we need; some authors use
a higher Nmin. It is also obvious that we cannot simply reduce λw to increase the
storage capacity because we need at least Nmin grains in the bit-volume. In perpendicular recording, we can reduce λw and increase t, keeping the bit volume the same,
which is one of its advantages.
The boundary between two neighboring one-bit patches is quite rugged, zigzagged, because the bit boundary follows the surfaces of the grains with the same
13

We can understand this with an analogy to the random walk example (impurity diffusion) in Section 1.8.2.
If I take N random steps, my root mean square distance from the origin is proportional to √N, which is noise
because the direction is random. (Remember that this is an analogy, not an explanation of the physics.)
The increase in SNR with smaller grains was particularly well known in the era of photographic films.

magnetization as shown in Figure 8.53a. The root mean square variation σ in the
position of the boundary represents another form of noise, jitter noise, inherent in
a granular medium even if we had a perfect write head. The jitter noise σ increases
with grain size d, and a very rough estimate gives σ ≈ d∕3. The signal is proportional
to the bit length λ whereas noise is proportional to σ so the SNR ratio will be roughly
proportional to λ∕σ, that is14
SNRjitter ≈ 20 log(λ∕σ)

[8.36]

It is desirable to keep σ less than 10 percent of the bit length λ. We need to adjust
our Nmin above to reflect both granular and jitter noise because both contribute significantly to the overall SNR.
Both granular and jitter noise are important limitations in using granular media
as a magnetic storage medium. We can try to reduce the grain size, and hence σ, as
we try and shrink the bit-volume, but there is still another fundamental limit.
We know that the energy involved in thermal fluctuations is roughly kT. The
energy involved in rotating the magnetization M in a magnetized grain (essentially,
a domain) from one direction to the opposite direction (changing 1 to 0 or vice versa)
depends on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, measured in energy per unit
domain volume (J m−3), which was defined in Section 8.5.2. In the present case, this
energy is given a special name called uniaxial magnetocrystalline energy Ku due
to the HCP crystal structure and the shape of the grains. Both influence Ku. Thus,
if Vgrain is the average grain volume, the energy needed to rotate M in a grain is
KuVgrain and this must be much greater than kT, say by a numerical factor of r (e.g.,
r = 40 − 60) for a thermally stable operation. We need at least KuVgrain ≈ rkT. We
cannot therefore expect to reduce the grain volume as much as we like because of
this fundamental limit. The advantage of perpendicular recording is that the magnetizing field is within the main magnetic flux through the whole thickness of the film
and it is stronger than in longitudinal recording; see Figure 8.52. We can therefore
increase the film thickness from t to t′ and shrink λ to λ′ as in Figure 8.53b. More
importantly, we can use a magnetic medium that has a higher Ku because the magnetizing field is stronger. This means Vgrain can be smaller. Consequently, we can
reduce the grain size (d) and still have sufficient Nmin number of grains within a
one-bit volume to avoid SNR problems.
When the grain size becomes so small that thermal energy (i.e., thermal fluctuations) can easily randomize the alignments of magnetized grains, then basically
the medium exhibits paramagnetic behavior as described in Section 8.2.2. This is
called the superparamagnetic state, and represents a fundamental limit on how
small we can make the domains.

NOTE: Ku is the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Data collected from various sources.

The deposition of the magnetic thin film involves vacuum deposition techniques such
as sputtering, electron beam evaporation or electroplating. Typical film thicknesses
are less than 30 nm. The film is not a single phase homogenous magnetic medium.
The magnetic material consists of crystalline grains (at present roughly 10 nm in
size) separated by a nonmagnetic amorphous region that is usually an oxide as mentioned above and shown in Figure 8.53c; it is a phase-separated medium. Each grain
is a single magnetic domain inasmuch as the grains are too small to support several
domains. Table 8.8 summarizes the properties of a typical thin-film storage medium.
The film must be such that it is able to retain the spatial magnetization pattern written on it after it has passed the write head. This requires high remanent magnetization Mr. High remanent magnetization is also important in the reading process
because the magnetic flux that penetrates into the sensor depends on this remanent
magnetization, given a particular speed of motion under the read head. Thus, the
read operation also requires a medium with high Mr. Further, it should be difficult
to undesirably erase the magnetic information on the disk by demagnetizing it under
stray fields, and this requires high coercivity Hc. However, Hc cannot be too high
because, otherwise, the inductive head will not be able to change the magnetization
M of a magnetic grain; we need a semihard magnetic medium. Most thin films are
alloys of Co because Co has a high degree of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy
and hence good coercivity Hc. Alloying Co with Cr provides good corrosion resistance and increases Hc. Alloying with Pt also increases Hc. The desired film properties can usually be obtained by alloying Co with other elements and optimizing the
deposition conditions; for example CoCrPt–SiO2 is considered to be a good magnetic
storage medium but there are many others. The crystal grains have the HCP structure,
which has a large Ku.
The magnetically soft underlayer (SUL) beneath the magnetic thin film in Figure 8.52 has to be sufficiently soft to be easily magnetized so that the magnetic field
lines from the write head, after passing through the thin film, will be restricted to
this layer. Consequently we need a soft medium with a high μr, e.g., greater than
100, and a high Msat that should match that of the write pole. There are several soft

magnetic media that serve as an SUL and a typical example is listed in Table 8.8.
There is usually a thin interlayer between the storage thin film and the SUL, as
shown in Figure 8.54, to magnetically separate the two layers. The interlayer can
also be used to control the grain orientations and size distribution in the recording
film. Further, the recording film itself may consist of several thin layers to tune the
magnetic properties of this medium. The interlayer may have two sublayers to tune
its properties as well. The current materials research on perpendicular recording
involves optimizing the interlayer and the soft underlayer towards higher capacity.
There is also a very thin top overcoat layer, usually carbon, to protect the magnetic
thin film’s surface.
The thin film inductive recording head in Figure 8.51c must be able to produce
a strong magnetizing field. The thin film coil is normally Cu and the oxide insulation
maybe SiO2 or Al2O3. The magnetic core is a soft medium that can be easily magnetized such as an NiFe alloy. The narrow pole at the tip of the write head above
the thin film storage medium has a large Msat or Bsat (Figure 8.32). For example CoFe
alloys can have Bsat around 2.4 T. What is important in recording digital information
is that the write head should generate a strong magnetizing field and whose direction
can be reversed by the coil. Table 8.8 summarizes some of the properties of materials involved in perpendicular magnetic recording.
So far we have only considered a granular magnetic recording medium. Within
this material system, a one-bit volume has many independent grains that have to be
magnetized. There is a limit to the bit-size as we need to have a certain number of
grains (Nmin); put differently, the grain size cannot be arbitrarily small. Suppose that
we fabricate a recording medium in which a bit is a well-defined nanostructure, and
these nanostructures are patterned to form a periodic array of “isolated magnetic
islands” as shown in Figure 8.55a. An SEM image of such a bit-patterned recording medium (BPRM) is shown in Figure 8.55b. Clearly, we no longer have a
granular medium and Equation 8.35 does not apply. Indeed, intuitively, we can
expect an N-fold increase in storage capacity, breaking through the limits of multigrain media. Further, we can develop write and read techniques that involve synchronization with the periodicity in the bit-pattern; obviously such new techniques
would require a more demanding technology for the inductive write head. This is
the advantage of BPRM. The array of magnetic bits in Figure 8.55b have a pitch of
35 nm, which corresponds roughly to 0.5 Tb in−2, a significant jump in areal storage
density. The magnetic medium in this case is a multilayer of Co/Pd films deposited
by sputtering on a patterned array of SO2 nanoposts. Magnetic bit arrays of smaller

pitches have also been recorded with areal bit densities over 1 Tb in−2. While the
BPRM has the potential for a much higher areal density, the actual techniques used
for writing and reading the bits are quite different. Further, the BPRM is not free of
imperfections such as variations in the periodicity of the array of magnetic bits,
which is essentially noise within this material system. Nonetheless, such BPRM have
been shown to have potential areal recording densities 1–1.5 Tb in−2, a factor of 10
higher than granular PRM.

EXAMPLE 8.9

AREAL DENSITY IN GRANULAR RECORDING MEDIA Consider a longitudinal recording

medium as in Figure 8.53a. Suppose that the magnetic grains have a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy Ku of 500 kJ m−3. The stability of magnetized grains against thermal
fluctuations means that the energy involved in rotating the magnetization M of a grain in the
wrong direction must be much greater than the thermal energy kT. Taking the ratio r = 50 in
KuVgrain ≈ rkT we find the minimum volume for a grain
Vgrain ≈ (50)(0.0259 eV)(1.602 × 10−19 J∕eV)∕(500 × 103 J m−3) = 4.15 × 10−25 m3 or 415 nm3.

If d is the mean grain size, we can take d3 to very roughly represent the grain volume.
Thus, d 3 ≈ Vgrain so that d ≈ 7.5 nm.
The one-bit volume will have N grains. If p is the volume fraction (packing factor) of
the grains in the film structure in Figure 8.53c, only the volume p(λwt) is occupied by N
magnetic grains. Thus,
p(λwt) = NVgrain

value. It is clear from Equation 8.38 that we can increase Dbit by increasing Ku and t, or
reducing N; but N is limited by the acceptable SNR.
Further, as an estimate, we can take the packing factor p = 0.85, w = 100 nm (write
head width), t = 20 nm (film thickness), N = 200 in Equations 8.37 to find λ = 49 nm,
which is the size of one-bit. We can now use Equation 8.38 with λ = 49 nm and w =
100 nm to find Dinfo = 205 bits μm−2 or 132 Gb in−2 in tracks and roughly 92.4 Gb in−2
on the disk.
Further, from Equation 8.35,
SNRgrain = 10 logN = 23.0 dB.

Taking σ ≈ d∕3 = 2.5 nm, from Equation 8.36,
SNRjitter ≈ 20 log(λ∕σ) = 25.8 dB.

The importance of Ku should be clearly apparent. There are magnetic media with higher Ku
values than 500 kJ m−3 used in this example. The above estimate calculations show that there is
a fundamental limit to how much information can be stored in a granular recording medium.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

8.12.1 ZERO RESISTANCE AND THE MEISSNER EFFECT
In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes at the University of Leiden in Holland observed that
when a sample of mercury is cooled to below 4.2 K, its resistivity totally vanishes
and the material behaves as a superconductor, exhibiting no resistance to current
flow. Other experiments since then have shown that there are many such substances,
not simply metals, that exhibit superconductivity when cooled below a critical
temperature Tc that depends on the material. On the other hand, there are also many
conductors, including some with the highest conductivities such as silver, gold,
and copper, that do not exhibit superconductivity. The resistivity of these normal
conductors at low temperatures is limited by scattering from impurities and crystal
defects and saturates at a finite value determined by the residual resistivity. The two
distinctly different types of behavior are depicted in Figure 8.56. Between 1911 and
1986, many different metals and metal alloys had been studied, and the highest
recorded critical temperature was about 23 K in a niobium–germanium compound

(Nb3Ge) whose superconductivity was discovered in the early 1970s. In 1986 Bednorz
and Müller, at IBM Research Laboratories in Zürich, discovered that a copper oxide–
based ceramic-type compound La–Ba–Cu–O, which normally has high resistivity,
becomes superconducting when cooled below 35 K. Following this Nobel prize–
winning discovery, a variety of copper oxide–based compounds (called cuprate ceramics)
have been synthesized and studied. In 1987 it was found that yttrium barium copper
oxide (Y–Ba–Cu–O) becomes superconducting at a critical temperature of 95 K,
which is above the boiling point of nitrogen (77 K). This discovery was particularly
significant because liquid nitrogen is an inexpensive cryogent that is readily liquified
and easy to use compared with cryogent liquids that had to be used in the past (liquid
helium). At present the highest critical temperature for a superconductor is around
130 K (−143 °C) for Hg–Ba–Ca–Cu–O. These superconductors with Tc above ∼30 K
are now typically referred as high-Tc superconductors. The quest for a near-roomtemperature superconductor goes on, with many scientists around the world trying
different materials, or synthesizing them, to raise Tc even higher. There are already
commercial devices utilizing high-Tc superconductors, for example, thin-film
SQUIDs15 that can accurately measure very small magnetic fluxes, high-Q filters,
resonant cavities in microwave communications, superconducting power cables and
superconducting fault current limiters.
The vanishing of resistivity is not the only characteristic of a superconductor. A
superconductor cannot be viewed simply as a substance that has infinite conductivity below its critical temperature. A superconductor below its critical temperature
expels all the magnetic field from the bulk of the sample as if it were a perfectly
diamagnetic substance. This phenomenon is known as the Meissner effect. Suppose
that we place a superconducting material in a magnetic field above Tc. The magnetic
field lines will penetrate the sample, as we expect for any low μr medium. However,
when the superconductor is cooled below Tc, it rejects all the magnetic flux in the
sample, as depicted in Figure 8.57. The superconductor develops a magnetization M
by developing surface currents, such that M and the applied field cancel everywhere
inside the sample. Put differently μoM is in the opposite direction to the applied

field and equal to it in magnitude. Thus, below Tc a superconductor is a perfectly
diamagnetic substance ( χm = −1). This should be contrasted with the behavior of
a perfect conductor, which only exhibits infinite conductivity, or ρ = 0, below Tc. If
we place a perfect conductor in a magnetic field and then cool it below Tc, the
magnetic field is not rejected. These two types of behavior are identified in Figure
8.57. If we switch off the field, the field around the superconductor simply disappears. But switching off the field means there is a decreasing applied field. This
change in the field induces currents in the perfect conductor by virtue of Faraday’s
law of induction. These currents generate a magnetic field that opposes the change
(Lenz’s law); in other words, they generate a field along the same direction as the
applied field to reenforce the decreasing field. As the current can be sustained (ρ = 0)
without Joule dissipation, it keeps on flowing and maintaining the magnetic field.
The two final situations are shown in Figure 8.57 and distinguish the Meissner effect,
a distinct characteristic of a superconductor, from the behavior of a perfect conductor ( ρ = 0 only). The photograph showing the levitation of a magnet above the
surface of a superconductor (Figure 8.58) is the direct result of the Meissner effect:
the exclusion of the magnet’s magnetic fields from the interior of the superconductor.
The transition from the normal state to the superconducting state as the temperature falls below the critical temperature has similarities with phase transitions
such as solid to liquid or liquid to vapor changes. At the critical temperature, there
is a sharp change in the heat capacity as one would observe for any phase change.
In the superconducting state, we cannot treat a conduction electron in isolation. The
electrons behave collectively and thereby impart the superconducting characteristics
to the substance, as discussed later.

8.12.2 TYPE I AND TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS
The superconductivity below the critical temperature has been observed to disappear
in the presence of an applied magnetic field exceeding a critical value denoted by
Bc. This critical field depends on the temperature and is a characteristic of the material. Figure 8.59 shows the dependence of the critical field on the temperature. The
critical field is maximum, Bc(0), when T = 0 K (obtained by extrapolation16). As
long as the applied field is below Bc at that temperature, the material is in the superconducting state, but when the field exceeds Bc, the material reverts to the normal
state. We know that in the superconducting state, the applied magnetic field lines
are expelled from the sample and the phenomenon is called the Meissner effect. The
external field, in fact, does penetrate the sample from the surface into the bulk, but
the magnitude of this penetrating field decreases exponentially from the surface.
If the field at the surface of the sample is Bo, then at a distance x from the surface,
the field is given by an exponential decay,
Penetration

where λ is a “characteristic length” of penetration, called the penetration depth,
and depends on the temperature and Tc (or the material). At the critical temperature,
the penetration length is infinite and any magnetic field can penetrate the sample
and destroy the superconducting state. Near absolute zero of temperature, however,

There is a third law to thermodynamics that is not as emphasized as the first two laws, which dominate all
branches of engineering; that is, one can never reach the absolute zero of temperature.

typical penetration depths are 10–100 nm. Figure 8.60 shows the Bc versus T behavior
for three example superconductors, tin, mercury, and lead.
Superconductors are classified into two types, called Type I and Type II, based
on their diamagnetic properties. In Type I superconductors, as the applied magnetic
field B increases, so does the opposing magnetization M until the field reaches the
critical field Bc, whereupon the superconductivity disappears. At that point, the perfect diamagnetic behavior, the Meissner effect, is lost, as illustrated in Figure 8.61.
A Type I superconductor below Bc is in the Meissner state, where it excludes all
the magnetic flux from the interior of the sample. Above Bc it is in the normal state,
where the magnetic flux penetrates the sample as it would normally and the conductivity is finite.
In the case of Type II superconductors, the transition does not occur sharply
from the Meissner state to the normal state but goes through an intermediate phase
in which the applied field is able to pierce through certain local regions of the
sample. As the magnetic field increases, initially the sample behaves as a perfect
diamagnet exhibiting the Meissner effect and rejecting all the magnetic flux. When
the applied field increases beyond a critical field denoted as Bc1, the lower critical
field, the magnetic flux lines are no longer totally expelled from the sample. The

overall magnetization M in the sample opposes the field, but its magnitude does
not cancel the field everywhere. As the field increases, M gets smaller and more
flux lines pierce through the sample until at Bc2, the upper critical field, all field
lines penetrate the sample and superconductivity disappears. This behavior is
shown in Figure 8.61. Type II superconductors therefore have two critical fields
Bc1 and Bc2.
When the applied field is between Bc1 and Bc2, the field lines pierce through the
sample through tubular local regions, as pictured in Figure 8.62. The sample develops
local small cylindrical (filamentary) regions of normal state in a matrix of superconducting state and the magnetic flux lines go through these filaments of local normal
state, as shown in Figure 8.62. The state between Bc1 and Bc2 is called the mixed
state (or vortex state) because there are two states—normal and superconducting—
mixed in the same sample. The filaments of normal state have finite conductivity
and a quantized amount of flux through them. Each filament is a vortex of flux lines
(hence the name vortex state). It should be apparent that there should be currents
circulating around the walls of vortices. These circulating currents ensure that the
magnetic flux through the superconducting matrix is zero. The sample overall has
infinite conductivity due to the superconducting regions. Figure 8.63 shows the
dependence of Bc1 and Bc2 on the temperature and identifies the regions of Meissner,
mixed, and normal states. All engineering applications of superconductors invariably
use Type II materials because Bc2 is typically much greater than Bc found in Type I
materials and, furthermore, the critical temperatures of Type II materials are higher
than those of Type I. Many superconductors, including the recent high-Tc superconductors, are of Type II. Table 8.9 summarizes the characteristics of selected Type I
and Type II superconductors.

8.12.3 CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY
Another important characteristic feature of the superconducting state is that when
the current density through the sample exceeds a critical value Jc, it is found that
superconductivity disappears. This is not surprising since the current through the
superconductor will itself generate a magnetic field and at sufficiently high current

and extinguish superconductivity. This plausible direct relation between Bc and Jc is
only true for Type I superconductors, whereas in Type II superconductors, Jc depends
in a complicated way on the interaction between the current and the flux vortices.
New high-Tc superconductors have exceedingly high critical fields, as apparent in
Table 8.9, that do not seem to necessarily translate to high critical current densities.
The critical current density in Type II superconductors depends not only on the
temperature and the applied magnetic field but also on the preparation and hence
the microstructure (e.g., polycrystallinity) of the superconductor material. Critical

current densities in new high-Tc superconductors vary widely with preparation conditions. For example, in Y–Ba–Cu–O, Jc may be greater than 107 A cm−2 in some carefully prepared thin films and single crystals but around 103–106 A cm−2 in some of the
polycrystalline bulk material (e.g., sintered bulk samples). In Nb3Sn, used in superconducting solenoid magnets, on the other hand, Jc is close to 107 A cm−2 at near 0 K.
The critical current density is important in engineering because it limits the total
current that can be passed through a superconducting wire or a device. The limits
of superconductivity are therefore defined by the critical temperature Tc, critical
magnetic field Bc (or Bc2), and critical current density Jc. These constitute a surface
in a three-dimensional plot, as shown in Figure 8.64, which separates the superconducting state from the normal state. Any operating point (T1, B1, J1) inside this
surface is in the superconducting state. When the cuprate ceramic superconductors
were first discovered, their Jc values were too low to allow immediate significant
applications in engineering. Their synthesis over the last 20 years has advanced to
a level that we can now benefit from large critical currents and fields. Over the same
temperature range, ceramic cuprate superconductors now easily outperform the traditional superconductors for many applications. There are already a number of applications of these high-Tc superconductors in the commercial market.
EXAMPLE 8.10

SUPERCONDUCTING SOLENOIDS17 Superconducting solenoid magnets can produce very

large magnetic fields up to ∼15 T or so, whereas the magnetic fields available from a ferromagnetic core solenoid is limited to ∼2 T. High field magnets used in magnetic resonance
imaging are based on superconducting solenoids wound using a superconducting wire. They are
operated around 4 K with expensive liquid helium as the cryogen. These superconducting wires
are typically Nb3Sn or NbTi alloy filaments embedded in a copper matrix. A very large current,
several hundred amperes, is passed through the solenoid winding to obtain the necessary high
magnetic fields. There is, of course, no Joule heating once the current is flowing in the superconducting state. The main problem is the large forces and hence stresses in the coil due to
large currents. Two wires carrying currents in the opposite direction repel each other, and the

force is proportional to I2. Thus the magnetic forces between the wires of the coil give rise to
outward radial forces trying to “blow open” the solenoid, as depicted in Figure 8.65. The forces
between neighboring wires are attractive and hence give rise to compressional forces squeezing
the solenoid axially. The solenoid has to have a proper mechanical support structure around it
to prevent mechanical fracture and failure due to large forces between the windings. The copper
matrix serves as mechanical support to cushion against the stresses as well as a good thermal
conductor in the event that superconductivity is inadvertently lost during operation.
Suppose that we have a superconducting solenoid that is 10 cm in diameter and 1 m in
length and has 500 turns of Nb3Sn wire, whose critical field Bc at 4.2 K (liquid He temperature) is about 20 T and critical current density Jc is 3 × 106 A cm−2. What is the current
necessary to set up a field of 5 T at the center of a solenoid? What is the approximate energy
stored in the solenoid? Assume that the critical current density decreases linearly with the
applied field. Further, assume also that the field across the diameter of the solenoid is approximately uniform (field at the windings is the same as that at the center).
SOLUTION

We can assume that we have a long solenoid, that is, length (100 cm) ≫ diameter (10 cm).
The field at the center of a long solenoid is given by

or

As the coil is 1 m and there are 500 turns, the coil wire radius must be 1 mm. If all the
cross section of the wire were of superconducting medium, then the corresponding current
density would be

or

2.5 × 105 A cm−2

The actual current density through the superconductors will be greater than this as the
wires are embedded in a metal matrix. Suppose that 20 percent by cross-sectional area (and
hence as volume percentage) is the superconductor; then the actual current density through
the superconductor is
Jsuper =

We now need the critical current density J′c at a field of 5 T. Assuming Jc decreases linearly
with the applied field and vanishes when B = Bc, we can find J′c, from linear interpolation
J′c = Jc

The actual current density Jsuper through the superconductors is less than this critical
value J′c. We can assume that the superconducting solenoid will operate “safely” (with all
other designs correctly implemented). It should be emphasized that accurate and reliable
calculations will involve the actual Jc–Bc–Tc surface, as in Figure 8.64 for the given material.
Since the field in the solenoid is B = 5 T, assuming that this is uniform along the axis
and the core is air, the energy density or energy per unit volume is

If all this energy can be converted to electrical work, it would light a 100 W lamp for
13 min (and if converted to mechanical work, it could lift a 7,900 kg truck by 1 m).

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY ORIGIN

Although superconductivity was discovered in 1911, the understanding of its origin
did not emerge until 1957 when Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer formulated the
theory (called the BCS theory) in terms of quantum mechanics. The quantum
mechanical treatment is certainly beyond the scope of this book, but one can nonetheless grasp an intuitive understanding, as follows. The cardinal idea is that, at
sufficiently low temperatures, two oppositely spinning and oppositely traveling electrons can attract each other indirectly through the deformation of the crystal lattice

of positive metal ions. The idea is illustrated pictorially in Figure 8.66. The electron
1 distorts the lattice around it and changes its vibrations as it passes through this
region. Random thermal vibrations of the lattice at low temperatures are not strong
enough to randomize this induced lattice distortion and vibration. The vibrations of
this distorted region now look differently to another electron, 2, passing by. This
second electron feels a “net” attractive force due to the slight displacements of positive metal ions from their equilibrium positions. The two electrons interact indirectly
through the deformations and vibrations of the lattice of positive ions. This indirect
interaction at sufficiently low temperatures is able to overcome the mutual Coulombic repulsion between the electrons and hence bind the two electrons to each other.
The two electrons are called a Cooper pair. The intuitive diagram in Figure 8.66,
of course, does not even convey the intuition why the spins of the electrons should
be opposite. The requirement of opposite spins comes from the formal quantum
mechanical theory. The net spin of the Cooper pair is zero and their net linear
momentum is also zero. There is a further significance to the pairing of electron
spins in the Cooper pair. As a quasi-particle, or an entity, the Cooper pair has no
net spin and hence the Cooper pairs do not obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics.18 They
can therefore all “condense” to the lowest energy state and possess one single wavefunction that can describe the whole collection of Cooper pairs. All the paired electrons are described collectively by a single coherent wavefunction Ψ, which extends
over the whole sample. A crystal imperfection cannot simply scatter a single Cooper
pair because all the pairs behave as a single entity—like a “huge molecule.” Scattering one pair involves scattering all, which is simply not possible. An analogy may
help. One can scatter an individual football player running on his own. But if all the
team members got together and moved forward arm in arm as a rigid line, then the
scattering of any one now is impossible, as the rest will hold him in the line and
continue to move forward (don’t forget, it’s only an analogy!). Superconductivity is
said to be a macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics.
The BCS theory has had good success with traditional superconductors, but it
is believed that it does not apply to high-Tc superconductors, that is, lattice vibrations
are not involved in the formation of Cooper pairs. The formation of a Cooper pair
is still the key concept in explaining the superconductivity but the Cooper electrons
are believed to be coupled by “spin waves” within the crystal. The spin of a moving

In fact, the Cooper pair without a net spin behaves as if is were a boson particle.

electron modifies the spins of the atoms around it, generating a spin wave, which
affects another nearby electron. The interactions lead to the formation of a Cooper
pair. Obviously, at high temperatures, lattice vibrations have sufficient energy to
disassociate the pair, and the crystal returns to the normal state.

JOSEPHSON EFFECT

The Josephson junction is a junction between two superconductors that are separated
by a thin insulator (a few nanometers thick) as depicted in Figure 8.67. If the insulating barrier is sufficiently thin, then there is a probability that the Cooper pairs
can tunnel across the junction. The wavefunction Ψ of the Cooper pair, however,
changes phase by θ when it tunnels through the junction, not unexpected as the pair
goes through a potential barrier. The maximum superconducting current Ic that can
flow through this weak link depends on not only the thickness and area (size) of the
insulator but also on the superconductor materials and the temperature. The current
I, or the supercurrent, through the junction due to Cooper pair tunneling is determined by the phase angle θ,
I = Ic sin θ

[8.40]

where Ic is the maximum current or the critical current. If the current through the
junction is controlled by an external circuit, then the tunneling Cooper pairs on either
side of the junction (in the superconductors) adjust their respective phases to maintain the phase change to satisfy Equation 8.40. If we plot the I–V characteristics of
this junction as in Figure 8.68, we would find that for I < Ic, the behavior follows
the vertical OC line with no voltage across the junction.
If the current through the junction exceeds Ic, then the Cooper pairs cannot tunnel through the insulator because Equation 8.40 cannot be satisfied. There is still a
current through the junction, but it is due to the tunneling of normal, that is, single
electrons as represented by the curve OABD in Figure 8.68. Thus, the current switches
from point C to point B and then follows the normal tunneling curve B to D. At
point B, a voltage develops across the junction and increases with the current. The
normal tunneling current in the range OA is negligible and rises suddenly when the
voltage exceeds Va. The reason is that a certain amount of voltage (corresponding

to a potential energy eVa) is needed to provide the necessary energy to disassociate
the tunneling single electron from its Cooper pair. It is apparent that the thin insulation acts as a weak superconductor or as a weak link in the superconductor; weak
with regard to the currents that can flow in the superconductor itself. The I–V characteristic in Figure 8.68a is symmetric about O, and is called the dc characteristic
of the Josephson junction. In addition, the I–V behavior exhibits hysteresis; that is,
if we were to decrease the current, the behavior does not follow DBC down to O,
but follows the DBA curve. When the current is decreased nearly to zero, the normal
tunneling current switches to the supercurrent. The Josephson junction is bistable;
that is, it has two states corresponding to the superconducting state OC and normal
state ABD. Thus, the device behaves as an electronic switch whose switching time,
in theory, is determined by tunneling times, in the picoseconds range. In practice the
switching time (∼10 ps) is limited by the junction capacitance. Figure 8.68b shows
the experimental I versus V characteristics for a Josephson junction that is made of
two tin superconductors with tin oxide as the weak link; it closely follows the
expected behavior in Figure 4.68a.
If, on the other hand, a dc voltage is applied across the Josephson junction, then
the phase change θ is modulated by the applied voltage. The most interesting and
surprising aspect is that the voltage modulates the rate of change of the phase through
the barrier, that is,
dθ 2eV
=
dt
ħ

When we integrate this, we find that θ is time and voltage dependent, so, according to Equation 8.40, the current is a sinusoidal function of time and voltage, that is,

The Josephson junction therefore generates an oscillating current of frequency f
when there is a dc voltage V across it. This is called the ac Josephson effect, a
remarkable phenomenon originally predicted by Josephson as a graduate student at
Cambridge (1962). According to the ac Josephson effect, the junction generates an
ac current at a frequency of 2e∕h Hz per volt or 483.6 MHz per microvolt. Furthermore, the frequency of the current has nothing to do with the material properties of
the junction but is only determined by the applied voltage through e and h. The ac
Josephson effect has been adopted to define the voltage standard: One volt is the
voltage that, when applied to a Josephson junction, will generate an ac current and
hence an electromagnetic radiation of frequency 483,597.9 GHz.

FLUX QUANTIZATION

Consider a ring of a superconducting material above its Tc. Suppose that the ring is
immersed in magnetic flux lines from a magnet placed above it as shown in Figure 8.69a. When we cool the ring to below Tc, the magnetic flux lines are excluded
from the ring itself, due to the Meissner effect, but they go through the hole, as
shown in Figure 8.69b. If we now remove the magnet, we may think that the magnetic flux lines simply disappear, but this is not the case. A persistent current is set
up on the inside surface of the superconducting ring that flows to maintain the flux
constant in the hollow. This supercurrent generates flux lines in the hollow as if to
replace those taken away by the removal of the magnet, as depicted in Figure 8.69c.
Since the current can flow indefinitely in the ring, the overall effect is that the
magnetic flux is trapped within the ring. Indeed, if we were to bring back the magnet, the current in the ring would disappear to ensure that the magnetic flux in
the hollow remains unchanged. The origin of flux trapping can be appreciated by
Figure 8.69 (a) Above Tc, the flux lines enter the
ring. (b) The ring and magnet are cooled through Tc.
The flux lines do not enter the superconducting
ring but stay in the hole. (c) Removing the magnet
does not change the flux in the hole.

considering what would happen if the flux were allowed to change, that is,
dΦ∕dt ≠ 0. A changing flux would induce a voltage V = −dΦ∕dt around the ring
that would drive an infinite current I = V∕R where R = 0. This is not possible, and
hence the flux cannot change, which means we must have dΦ∕dt = 0. One should
also note that there can be no electric field inside a superconductor because
E=

since the conductivity σ is infinite.
What would happen if we have a superconducting ring (below Tc) that initially
had no flux in the hole? If we were to bring a magnet to it, then the flux lines would
now be excluded from both the ring itself and also the hole since the trapped flux
within the ring is zero.
It turns out that the trapped flux Φ inside the ring is quantized by virtue of superconductivity being a quantum phenomenon. The smallest quantized amount of flux
is called the magnetic flux quantum and is given by h∕2e or 2.0679 × 10−15 Wb.

Antiferromagnetic materials have crystals in which
alternating permanent atomic spin magnetic moments
are equal in magnitude but point in opposite directions
(antiparallel), which leads to no net magnetization of
the crystal.
Bloch wall is a magnetic domain wall.
Bohr magneton ( β) is a useful elementary unit of
magnetic moment on the atomic scale. It is equal to the
magnetic moment of one electron spin along an applied magnetic field β = eħ∕2me.
Coercivity or coercive field (Hc) measures the ability
of a magnetized material to resist demagnetization. It is
the required reverse applied field that would remove
any remanent magnetization, that is, demagnetize the
material.
Cooper pair is a quasi-particle formed by the mutual
attraction of two electrons with opposite spins and opposite linear momenta below a critical temperature. It
has a charge of −2e and a mass of 2me but no net spin.
It does not obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. The electrons are
held together by the induced distortions and vibrations

of the lattice of positive metal ions with which the electrons interact.
Critical magnetic field (Bc) is the maximum field
that can be applied to a superconductor without destroying the superconducting behavior. Bc decreases
from its maximum value at absolute zero to zero at Tc.
Critical temperature (Tc) is a temperature that separates the superconducting state from the normal state.
Above Tc, the substance is in the normal state with a
finite resistivity, but below Tc, it is in the superconducting state with zero resistivity.
Curie temperature (TC) is the critical temperature at
which the ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties
are lost. Above the Curie temperature, the material behaves as if it were paramagnetic.
Diamagnetic material has a negative magnetic susceptibility and reduces or repels applied magnetic
fields. Superconductors are perfect diamagnets that repel the applied field. Many substances possess weak
diamagnetism, so the applied field is slightly decreased
within the material.

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

Domain wall is a region between two neighboring
magnetic domains of differing orientations of magnetization.
Domain wall energy is the excess energy in the domain wall as a result of the gradual orientations of the
neighboring spin magnetic moments of atoms through
the wall region. It is the excess energy due to the excess
exchange interaction energy, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and magnetostrictive energy in the
wall region.
Easy direction is the crystal direction along which the
atomic magnetic moments (due to spin) are spontaneously and most easily aligned. Exchange interaction
energy is lowest (hence favorable) when the alignment
of atomic spin magnetic moments is in this direction in
the crystal. For the iron crystal, it is one of the six [100]
directions (cube edge).
Eddy current loss is the Joule energy loss (I2R) in a
ferromagnetic material subjected to changing magnetic
fields (in ac fields). The varying magnetic field induces voltages in the ferromagnetic material that drive
currents (called eddy currents) that generate Joule
heating due to I2R.
Eddy currents are the induced conduction currents
flowing in a ferromagnetic material as a result of varying (ac) magnetic fields.
Exchange interaction energy (Eex) is a kind of Coulombic interaction energy between two neighboring
electrons and positive metal ions that depends on the
relative spin orientations of the electrons as a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. Its exact origin is quantum mechanical. Qualitatively, different
spins lead to different electron wavefunctions, different negative charge distributions, and hence different
Coulombic interactions. In ferromagnetic crystals, Eex
is negative when the neighboring electron spins are
parallel.
Ferrimagnetic materials possess crystals that contain two sets of atomic magnetic moments that oppose
each other, but one set has greater strength and therefore there is a net magnetization of the crystal. An unmagnetized ferrimagnetic substance normally has
many magnetic domains whose magnetization vectors
add to give no overall magnetization.

Ferrites are ferrimagnetic materials that are ceramics
with insulating properties. They are therefore used in
HF applications where eddy current losses are significant. Their general composition is (MO)(Fe2O3), where
M is typically a divalent metal. For magnetically soft
ferrites, M is typically Fe, Mn, Zn, or Ni, whereas for
magnetically hard ferrites, M is typically Sr or Ba.
Hard ferrites such as BaOFe2O3 have the hexagonal
crystal structure with a high degree of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and therefore possess high coercivity
(difficult to demagnetize).
Ferromagnetic materials have the ability to possess
large permanent magnetizations even in the absence of
an applied field. An unmagnetized ferromagnetic material normally has many magnetic domains whose
magnetization vectors add to give no overall magnetization. However, in a sufficiently strong magnetizing
field, the whole ferromagnetic substance becomes one
magnetic domain in which all the atomic spin magnetic
moments are aligned to give a large magnetization
along the field. Some of this magnetization is retained
even after the removal of the field.
Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is the large change
in the resistance of a special multilayer structure
when a magnetic field is applied; the simplest structure usually consists of two thin ferromagnetic layers
(e.g., Fe) sandwiching an even thinner nonmagnetic
metal (e.g., Cu).
Hard direction is the crystal direction along which it
is hardest to align the atomic spin magnetic moments
relative to the easy direction. Exchange interaction energy Eex favors the easy direction most (Eex is most
negative) and favors the hard direction least (Eex is least
negative).
Hard magnetic materials characteristically have
high remanent magnetizations (Br) and high coercivities (Hc), so once magnetized, they are difficult to demagnetize. They are suitable for permanent magnet
applications. They have broad B–H hysteresis loops.
Hard magnetic particles are small particles of various shapes that have high coercivity due to having a
single magnetic domain with high magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy, or possessing substantial shape anisotropy (aspect ratio—length-to-width ratio).

DEFINING TERMS
Hysteresis loop is the magnetization (M) versus applied magnetic field intensity (H) or B versus H behavior of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) substance
through one cycle as it is repeatedly magnetized and
demagnetized.
Hysteresis loss is the energy loss involved in magnetizing and demagnetizing a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) substance. It arises from various energy losses
involved in the irreversible motions of the domain
walls. Hysteresis loss per unit volume of specimen is
the area of the B–H hysteresis loop.
Initial permeability (μri μo) is the initial slope of the B
versus H characteristic of an unmagnetized ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material and typically represents the magnetic permeability under very small
applied magnetic fields. Initial relative permeability
(μri) is the relative permeability of an unmagnetized
ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material under very
small applied fields.
Magnetic dipole moment (μm) is defined as IAun,
where I is the current flowing in a circuit loop of area
A and un is the unit vector in the direction of an advance of a screw when it is turned in the direction of
the circulating current. Qualitatively, it measures the
strength of the magnetic field created by a current loop
and also the extent of interaction of the current loop
with an externally applied magnetic field. μm is normal
to the surface of the loop. Magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that tries to rotate μm to
align it with the field. In a nonuniform field, the magnetic moment experiences a force that attracts it to a
greater field.
Magnetic domain is a region of a ferromagnetic (or
ferrimagnetic) crystal that has spontaneous magnetization, that is, magnetization in the absence of an applied
field, due to the alignment of all magnetic moments in
that region.
Magnetic field, magnetic induction, or magnetic
flux density (B) is a field that is generated by a currentcarrying conductor that produces a force on a currentcarrying conductor elsewhere. Equivalently, we can
define it as the field generated by a moving charge that
acts to produce a force on a moving charge elsewhere.
The force is called the Lorentz force and is given by
F = qv × B where v is the velocity of the particle with

845

charge q. The magnetic field B in a material is the sum
of the applied field μoH, and that due to the magnetization of the material μoM, that is, B = μo(H + M).
Magnetic field intensity or magnetizing field (H)
gauges the magnetic strength of external conduction
currents (e.g., currents flowing in the windings) in the
absence of a material medium. It excludes the magnetization currents that become induced on the surfaces
of any material placed in a magnetic field. μoH is the
magnetic field in free space and is considered to be the
applied magnetic field. The terms intensity or strength
distinguish H from B, which is simply called the magnetic field.
Magnetic flux (Φ) represents to what extent magnetic
field lines are flowing through a given area perpendicular to the field lines. If δA is a small area perpendicular to the magnetic field B and B is constant over
δA, then the flux δΦ through δA is defined by δΦ = B δA.
Total flux through any closed surface is zero.
Magnetic permeability (μ) is the magnetic field generated per unit magnetizing field, that is, μ = B∕H.
Permeability gauges the effectiveness of a medium in
generating as much magnetic field as possible per unit
magnetizing field. Permeability of free space is the absolute permeability μo, which is the magnetic field generated in a vacuum per unit magnetizing field.
Magnetic susceptibility (χm) indicates the ease with
which the material becomes magnetized under an applied magnetic field. It is the magnetization induced in
the material per unit magnetizing field, χm = M∕H.
Magnetization or magnetization vector (M) represents the net magnetic moment per unit volume of material. In the presence of a magnetic field, individual
atomic moments tend to align with the field, which results in a net magnetization. Magnetization of a specimen can be represented by the flow of currents on the
surface over a unit length of the specimen; M = Im,
where Im is the surface magnetization current per unit
length.
Magnetization current (Im) is a bound current per
unit length that exists on the surface of a substance due
to its magnetization. It is not, however, due to the flow
of free charges but arises in the presence of an applied
magnetic field as a result of the orientations of the

846

CHAPTER 8

electronic motions in the constituent atoms. In the
bulk, these electronic motions cancel each other and
there is no net bulk current, but on the surface, they add
to give a bound surface current Im per unit length,
which is equal to the magnetization M of the substance.
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is the anisotropy associated with magnetic properties such as the magnetization in different directions in a ferromagnetic (or
ferrimagnetic) crystal. Atomic spins prefer to align
along certain directions in the crystal, called easy directions. The direction along which it is most difficult
to align the spins is called the hard direction. For example, in the iron crystal, all atomic spins prefer to
align along one of the [100] directions (easy directions) and it is most difficult to align the spins along
one of the [111] directions (hard directions).
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (K) is the energy needed to rotate the magnetization of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) crystal from its natural easy
direction to a hard direction. For example, it takes an
energy of about 48 mJ cm−3 to rotate the magnetization
of an iron crystal from the easy direction [100] to the
hard direction [111].
Magnetoresistance generally refers to the change in
the resistance of a magnetic material when it is placed
in a magnetic field. The change in the resistance of a
nonmagnetic metal, such as copper, is usually very
small. In a magnetic metal, the change in the resistivity
due to the applied magnetic field is anisotropic; that is,
it depends on the direction of current flow with respect
to the applied field and is called anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).
Magnetostatic energy is the potential energy stored
in an external magnetic field. It takes external work to
establish a magnetic field, and this energy is said to be
stored in the magnetic field. Magnetic energy per unit
volume at a point in free space is given by
Evol (air) =

Magnetostriction is the change in the length of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) crystal as a result of its
magnetization. An iron crystal placed in a magnetic
field along an easy direction becomes longer along this
direction but contracts in the transverse direction.

Magnetostrictive energy is the strain energy in the
crystal due to magnetostriction, that is, the work done
in straining the crystal when it becomes magnetized.
Maximum relative permeability (μr,max) is the maximum relative permeability of a ferromagnetic (or
ferrimagnetic) material.
Meissner effect is the repulsion of all magnetic flux
from the interior of a superconductor. The superconductor behaves as if it were a perfect diamagnet with
χm = −1.
Paramagnetic materials have a small and positive
magnetic susceptibility. In an applied field, they develop a small amount of magnetization in the direction
of the applied field, so the magnetic field in the material is slightly greater. They are attracted to a higher
magnetic field.
Relative permeability (μr) measures the magnetic
field in a medium with respect to that in a vacuum,
μr = B∕μoH. Since B depends on the magnetization of
the medium, μr measures the ease with which the material becomes magnetized.
Remanence or remanent magnetization (Mr) is the
magnetization that remains in a magnetic material after it has been fully magnetized and the magnetizing
field has been removed. It measures the ability of a
magnetic material to retain a portion of its magnetization after the removal of the applied field. The corresponding magnetic field (μoMr) is the remanent
magnetic field Br.
Saturation magnetization is the maximum magnetization that can be obtained in a ferromagnetic crystal at
a given temperature when all the magnetic moments
have been aligned in the direction of the applied field,
when there is a single magnetic domain with its magnetization M along the applied field.
Shape anisotropy is the anisotropy in magnetic
properties associated with the shape of the ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) substance. A crystal rod that
is thin and long prefers to have its magnetization M
along the length (long axis) of the rod because this
direction of magnetization creates less external magnetic fields and leads to less external magnetostatic energy compared with the case when M is
along the width (short axis) of the rod. Reversing the

hence magnetostatic energy are large, and requires
large substantial work. It is therefore difficult to rotate magnetization around from the long axis to the
short axis.

Type I superconductors have a single critical field
(Bc) above which the superconducting behavior is totally lost.
Type II superconductors have a lower (Bc1) and an
upper (Bc2) critical field. Below Bc1, the substance is in
the superconducting phase with Meissner effect; all
magnetic flux is excluded from the interior. Between
Bc1 and Bc2, magnetic flux lines pierce through local
filamentary regions of the superconductor, which behave normally. Above Bc2, the superconductor reverts
to normal behavior.

Soft magnetic materials characteristically have high
saturation magnetizations (Bsat) but low saturation
magnetizing fields (Hsat) and low coercivities (Hc), so
they can be magnetized and demagnetized easily. They
have tall and narrow B–H hysteresis loops.
Superconductivity is a phenomenon in which a substance loses all resistance to current flow (acquires

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

What is the total magnetization current on the surface of the magnetized iron alloy specimen?
If we were to remove the iron-alloy core and attempt to obtain the same magnetic field of
1.5 T inside the solenoid, how much current would we need? Is there a practical way of doing
this?

Magnetic reluctance Figure 8.71a shows an electromagnet with a rectangular core of area Ac. The
core has a narrow air gap and we wish to find the magnetic field in the gap; at least estimate it.
Circuits like this can be easily and approximately solved by using reluctances. Suppose that we apply
Ampere’s law around the mean circumference, we have
Hℓc + Hℓg = NI
We also know that the flux Φ must be continuous. We assume that both H and B are approximately
uniform across the cross section of the core and also the gap; we neglect the fringing field in the
gap. The core and the air gap have the same cross-sectional area Ag = Ac. The flux Φ ≈ Bc Ac ≈ Bg Ag,
and B = μH where μ is the total permeability of the region in which B and H are being related. In
analogy with electrical resistance, the reluctance of a magnetic component, using the core and gap
as examples, are defined by

in which NI acts like an EMF, and is called the magnetomotive force (MMF). The quantity flowing, the
flux Φ, acts like an electric current. The core and the air gap are in series, so Rc and Rg are added. Clearly
there is a good analogy with electric circuits. Suppose that the coil has 400 turns, and we pass 1.5 A. The
core is made of steel with μr ≈ 1000, the length ℓc is 30 cm and the cross sectional area (Ac) is 2 cm2. If
the air gap is 1 mm, find the magnetic field Bg in the gap. What is the flux in this magnetic circuit?
Consider the electromagnet in Figure 8.71b. The two yokes essentially guide the flux from the
core of the electromagnet to the point of use—the air gap. The end of the yoke has a smaller
cross-sectional area and is called the pole. The pole can even be a different material. Each component
can be assigned a reluctance so that the total reluctance is Rcore + 2Ryoke + 2Rpole + Rgap. We would
like to bring as much flux as possible to the gap and generate a field Bg = Φ∕Ag. The yoke should
be sufficiently long to bring the flux to the gap, the point of use. Is it necessary for the yoke be the
same material as the core? What determines the choice of the yoke material? If we use a different
material for the poles, what would you recommend? Does the location of the coil matter?

Design of an electromagnet Question 8.3 introduced the concept of a magnetic reluctance. Figure
8.71b shows an electromagnet that we can use to generate a field in a small air gap. There are many
possible designs. Using the magnetic reluctance approach, design an electromagnet in which the core
is 12 cm long and has a square cross sectional of area of 16 cm2. The air gap has a square cross
sectional area of 2 × 2 cm2 and a gap size (ℓg) of 5 mm. The field in the gap is 0.7 T. Your design
needs to specify NI, the diameters of the core and yoke, and the relative permeability of each component (core, yoke, and pole). (Neglect the fringing field.)

Pauli spin paramagnetism Paramagnetism in metals depends on the number of conduction
electrons that can flip their spins and align with the applied magnetic field. These electrons are

A toroidal inductor
a. Equations 8.46 and 8.47 allow the inductance of a toroidal coil in electronics to be calculated.
Equation 8.47 is the equation that is used in practice. Consider a toroidal inductor used in electronics that has a ferrite core of size FT-23 that is round but with a rectangular cross section.
The outer diameter is 0.230 in (5.842 mm), the inner diameter is 0.120 in (3.05 mm), and the
height of the core is 0.06 in (1.5 mm). The ferrite core is a 43-Mix that has an initial relative
permeability of 850 and a maximum relative permeability of 3000. The inductance index for this
43-Mix ferrite core of size FT-23 is AL = 188 (mH∕1000 turns). If the inductor has 25 turns,
then using Equations 8.46 and 8.47, calculate the inductance of the coil under small-signal

Design of a ferrite antenna for an AM receiver We consider an AM radio receiver that is to

with a ferrite rod as core, as depicted in Figure 8.73. The coil has N turns, its length is ℓ, and the
cross-sectional area is A. The inductance L of this coil is tuned with a variable capacitor C. The
maximum value of C is 265 pF, which with L should correspond to tuning in the lowest frequency
at 530 kHz. The coil with the ferrite core receives the EM waves, and the magnetic field of the EM
wave permeates the ferrite core and induces a voltage across the coil. This voltage is detected by a
sensitive amplifier, and in subsequent electronics it is suitably demodulated. The coil with the ferrite
core therefore acts as the antenna of the receiver (ferrite antenna). We will try to find a suitable design
for the ferrite coil by carrying out approximate calculations—in practice some trial and error experimentation would also be necessary. We will assume that the inductance of a finite solenoid is

Magnetic recording principles In this “back of an envelope” calculation we consider the principle
of operation of a recording head for writing on a magnetic tape. Magnetic tape is still currently used
for large archival storage, and the problem here would also apply to longitudinal recording on hard
disk media. The recording head has a small gap, of size g (about 1 μm or less), which is much smaller
than the mean circumference of the head ℓ (perhaps a few millimeters) as shown in Figure 8.75. The
coil of this head has N turns and is energized by the signal current i. The fringe field intensity Hf at
the gap magnetizes the magnetic tape passing under the head. Hf must be greater than the coercivity
Hc of the storage medium (tape) to be able to magnetize that region of the tape under the head. Suppose that Hm = magnetic field intensity in the core of the head; Hg = magnetic field intensity in the
gap; Hf = fringing field intensity below the gap; Bm = μrμoHm = magnetic field in the core of the
head; Bg = μoHg = magnetic field in the gap.

Thermal effects in information storage in granular magnetic recording media Consider a granular medium that is used in magnetic recording. If the grain size is Vgrain then the energy involved in
rotating the magnetization of this grain (domain) is KuVgrain. Due to thermal agitation, that is thermal
fluctuations in the medium, there is a probability that the magnetism of a grain can be flipped. The
rate at which such a process occurs, as we saw in Section 1.8.1 depends on the potential energy barrier involved in the process, which is the activation energy EA; it is a thermally activated process. For
simplicity, we will assume that EA = KuVgrain. Suppose there are No domains in a one-bit patch at time
t = 0 and we magnetize them all in the same direction, then at time t there will only be N number
of domains remaining with the same magnetization. The rate of change in N is thermally activated
and also depends on N, how many domains are remaining that need to be flipped. One possible

have a volume distribution and d is only an average. There is therefore a distribution of EA and the treatment

out the windings as depicted in Figure 8.65. Suppose that A is the surface area of the core (on to

The mean diameter Dtoroid of the toroid, ( 12 ) (Outside diameter + Inside diameter), is 10 times
longer than the core diameter Dcore. The field inside the toroid is therefore reasonably uniform
to within 10 percent.
The maximum operating magnetic field in the core is 35 T. Fields larger than this can result in
mechanical fracture and failure.
Assume that Jc decreases linearly with the magnetic field and that the mechanical engineers

support structure.
Find the size of the toroid (mean diameter and circumference), the number of turns and the length

below the critical current at that field. Is it feasible?

Optical Properties of Materials

The way electromagnetic (EM) radiation interacts with matter depends very much
on the wavelength of the EM wave. Many familiar types of EM radiation have wavelengths that range over many orders of magnitude. Although radio waves and X-rays
are both EM waves, the two interact in a distinctly different way with matter. We tend
to think of “light” as the electromagnetic radiation that we can see, that is, wavelengths in the visible range, typically 400 to 700 nm. However, in many applications,
light is also used to describe EM waves that can have somewhat shorter or longer
wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light. For many practical
purposes, it is useful to (arbitrarily) define light as EM waves that have wavelengths
shorter than very roughly 100 μm but longer than long-wavelength X-rays, roughly
10 nm. Today’s light wave communications use EM waves with wavelengths of 1300
and 1550 nm; in the infrared. Optical properties of materials are those characteristic
properties that determine the interaction of light with matter; the best example being
the refractive index n that determines the speed of light in a medium through v = c∕n,
where v is the speed of light in the medium and c is the speed of light in free space.
The present chapter examines the key optical properties of matter and how these
depend on the material and on the characteristics of the EM wave. The refractive
index n, for example, depends on the dielectric polarization mechanisms as well as
the wavelength λ. The material’s n–λ behavior is called the dispersion relation and
is one of the most important characteristics in many optical device applications.
We know from Chapter 3 that, depending on the experiment, we can treat light
either as an EM wave, exhibiting typical wave-like properties, or as photons, exhibiting particle-like behavior. In this chapter we will primarily use the wave nature of
light, though for absorption of light, the photon interpretation is more appropriate
as the photons interact with electrons in the material.

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

LIGHT WAVES IN A HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM

We know from well-established experiments that light exhibits typical wave-like
properties such as interference and diffraction. We can treat light as an EM wave
with time-varying electric and magnetic fields Ex and By, respectively, which propagate through space in such a way that they are always perpendicular to each other
and the direction of propagation z is as depicted in Figure 9.1. The simplest traveling wave is a sinusoidal wave, which, for propagation along z, has the general mathematical form,1
Traveling
wave along z

Ex = Eo cos(ωt − kz + ϕo)

[9.1]

where Ex is the electric field at position z at time t; k is the propagation constant,
or wavenumber, given by 2π∕λ, where λ is the wavelength; ω is the angular frequency; Eo is the amplitude of the wave; and ϕo is a phase constant which accounts
for the fact that at t = 0 and z = 0, Ex may or may not necessarily be zero depending on the choice of origin. The argument (ωt − kz + ϕo) is called the phase of the
wave and denoted by ϕ. Equation 9.1 describes a monochromatic plane wave of
infinite extent traveling in the positive z direction as depicted in Figure 9.2. In any
plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (along z), the phase of the wave,
according to Equation 9.1, is constant which means that the field in this plane is
also constant. A surface over which the phase of a wave is constant is referred to as
a wavefront. A wavefront of a plane wave is obviously a plane perpendicular to the
direction of propagation as shown in Figure 9.2.
We know from electromagnetism that time-varying magnetic fields result in
time-varying electric fields (Faraday’s law) and vice versa. A time-varying electric
field would set up a time-varying magnetic field with the same frequency. According to electromagnetic principles,2 a traveling electric field Ex as represented by
Equation 9.1 would always be accompanied by a traveling magnetic field By with
the same wave frequency and propagation constant (ω and k) but the directions of
the two fields would be orthogonal as in Figure 9.1. Thus, there is a similar traveling wave equation for the magnetic field component By. We generally describe the
interaction of a light wave with a nonconducting matter (conductivity, σ = 0) through
the electric field component Ex rather than By because it is the electric field that
displaces the electrons in molecules or ions in the crystal and thereby gives rise to
the polarization of matter. However, the two fields are linked, as in Figure 9.1, and
there is an intimate relationship between the two fields. The optical field refers to the
electric field Ex.
We can also represent a traveling wave using the exponential notation since
cos ϕ = Re[exp( jϕ)] where Re refers to the real part. We then need to take the

This chapter uses E for the electric field which was reserved for energy in previous chapters. There should be
no confusion with Eg that represents the energy bandgap. In addition, n is used to represent the refractive
index rather than the electron concentration.

Maxwell’s equations formulate electromagnetic phenomena and provide relationships between the electric and
magnetic fields and their space and time derivatives. We only need to use a few selected results from Maxwell’s
equations without delving into their derivations. The magnetic field B is also called the magnetic induction or
magnetic flux density.

We indicate the direction of propagation with a vector k, called the wavevector,
whose magnitude is the propagation constant k = 2π∕λ. It is clear that k is perpendicular to constant phase planes as indicated in Figure 9.2. When the EM wave is
propagating along some arbitrary direction k, as indicated in Figure 9.3, then the
electric field E(r, t) at a point r on a plane perpendicular to k is
E(r, t) = Eo cos(ωt − k · r + ϕo)

[9.3]

because the dot product k · r is along the direction of propagation similar to kz. The
dot product is the product of k and the projection of r onto k which is r′ in Figure 9.3,
so k · r = kr′. Indeed, if propagation is along z, k · r becomes kz. In general, if k
has components kx, ky, and kz along the x, y, and z directions, then from the definition of the dot product, k · r = kxx + kyy + kzz.
The time and space evolution of a given phase ϕ, for example, the phase corresponding to a maximum field, according to Equation 9.1 is described by
ϕ = ωt − kz + ϕo = constant

During a time interval δt, this constant phase (and hence the maximum field)
moves a distance δz. The phase velocity of this wave is therefore δz∕δt. Thus the
phase velocity v is

where f is the frequency (ω = 2πf ).
We are frequently interested in the phase difference Δϕ at a given time
between two points on a wave (Figure 9.1) that are separated by a certain distance.
If the wave is traveling along z with a wavevector k, as in Equation 9.1, then the
phase difference between two points separated by Δz is simply k Δz since ωt is
the same for each point. If this phase difference is 0 or multiples of 2π, then the
two points are in phase. Thus, the phase difference Δϕ can be expressed as k Δz
or 2π Δz∕λ.

REFRACTIVE INDEX

863

REFRACTIVE INDEX

When an EM wave is traveling in a dielectric medium, the oscillating electric field
polarizes the molecules of the medium at the frequency of the wave. Intuitively, the
EM wave propagation can be considered to be the propagation of this polarization
in the medium. The field and the induced molecular dipoles become coupled. The
net effect is that the polarization mechanism delays the propagation of the EM wave.
The stronger the interaction between the field and the dipoles, the slower is the
propagation of the wave. The relative permittivity εr measures the ease with which
the medium becomes polarized, and hence it indicates the extent of interaction
between the field and the induced dipoles. For an EM wave traveling in a nonmagnetic dielectric medium of relative permittivity εr, the phase velocity v is given by
v=

1
√εr εo μo

[9.5]

If the frequency f is in the optical frequency range, then εr will be due to electronic
polarization as ionic polarization will be too sluggish to respond to the field. However, at the infrared frequencies or below, the relative permittivity also includes a
significant contribution from ionic polarization and the phase velocity is slower. For
an EM wave traveling in free space, εr = 1 and vvacuum = 1∕√εo μo = c = 3 × 108 m s−1,
the velocity of light in a vacuum. The ratio of the speed of light in free space to its
speed in a medium is called the refractive index n of the medium,
n=

c
= √εr
v

[9.6]

Suppose that in free space ko is the wavevector (ko = 2π∕λo) and λo is the wavelength, then the wavevector k in the medium will be nko and the wavelength λ will
be λo∕n. Indeed, we can also define the refractive index in terms of the wavevector
k in the medium with respect to that in a vacuum ko,
n=

k
ko

[9.7]

Equation 9.6 is in agreement with our intuition that light propagates more slowly
in a denser medium which has a higher refractive index. We should note that the
frequency f remains the same. The refractive index of a medium is not necessarily
the same in all directions. In noncrystalline materials such as glasses and liquids,
the material structure is the same in all directions and n does not depend on the
direction. The refractive index is then isotropic. In crystals, however, the atomic
arrangements and interatomic bonding are different along different directions. Crystals,
in general, have nonisotropic, or anisotropic, properties. Depending on the crystal
structure, the relative permittivity εr is different along different crystal directions.
This means that, in general, the refractive index n seen by a propagating EM wave
in a crystal will depend on the value of εr along the direction of the oscillating
electric field (that is, along the direction of polarization). For example, suppose that
the wave in Figure 9.1 is traveling along the z direction in a particular crystal with
its electric field oscillating along the x direction. If the relative permittivity along

this x direction is εrx, then nx = √εrx . The wave therefore propagates with a phase
velocity that is c∕nx. The variation of n with direction of propagation and the direction of the electric field depends on the particular crystal structure. With the exception of cubic crystals (such as diamond) all crystals exhibit a degree of optical
anisotropy which leads to a number of important applications. Typically noncrystalline solids, such as glasses and liquids, and cubic crystals are optically isotropic;
they possess only one refractive index for all directions.
EXAMPLE 9.1

RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY AND REFRACTIVE INDEX Relative permittivity εr, or the dielectric constant, of materials is frequency dependent and further it depends on crystallographic
direction since it is easier to polarize the medium along certain directions in the crystal. Glass
has no crystal structure; it is amorphous. The relative permittivity is therefore isotropic but
nonetheless frequency dependent.
The relationship n = √εr between the refractive index n and εr must be applied at the
same frequency for both n and εr. The relative permittivity for many materials can be vastly
different at high and low frequencies because different polarization mechanisms operate at
these frequencies. At low frequencies all polarization mechanisms present can contribute to
εr, whereas at optical frequencies only the electronic polarization can respond to the oscillating field. Table 9.1 lists the relative permittivity εr (LF) at low frequencies (e.g., 60 Hz or
1 kHz as would be measured for example using a capacitance bridge in the laboratory) for
various materials. It then compares √εr (LF) with n.
For diamond and silicon there is an excellent agreement between √εr (LF) and n. Both
are covalent solids in which electronic polarization (electronic bond polarization) is the only
polarization mechanism at low and high frequencies. Electronic polarization involves the
displacement of light electrons with respect to positive ions of the crystal. This process can
readily respond to the field oscillations up to optical or even ultraviolet frequencies.
For AgCl and SiO2, √εr (LF) is larger than n because at low frequencies both of these
solids possess a degree of ionic polarization. The bonding has a substantial degree of ionic
character which contributes to polarization at frequencies below far-infrared wavelengths.
(The AgCl crystal has almost all ionic bonding.) In the case of water, the εr (LF) is dominated
by orientational or dipolar polarization which is far too sluggish to respond to high-frequency
oscillations of the field at optical frequencies.

It is instructive to consider what factors affect n. The simplest (and approximate) expression for the relative permittivity is
Nα
εr ≈ 1 +

[9.8]

where N is the number of molecules per unit volume and α is the polarizability per molecule.
Both atomic concentration, or density, and polarizability therefore increase n. For example,

DISPERSION: REFRACTIVE

The refractive index of materials in general depends on the frequency, or the wavelength. This wavelength dependence follows directly from the frequency dependence
of the relative permittivity εr. Figure 9.4 shows what happens to an atom in the
presence of an oscillating electric field E which is due to a light wave passing
through this location; it may also be due to an applied external field.
In the absence of an electric field and in equilibrium, the center of mass C
of the orbital motions of the electrons coincides with the positively charged
nucleus at O and the net electric dipole moment is zero as indicated in Figure 9.4a.
Suppose that the atom has Z number of electrons orbiting the nucleus and all the
electrons are contained within a given shell. In the presence of the electric field
E, however, the light electrons become displaced in the opposite direction to the
field, so their center of mass C is shifted by some distance x with respect to the
nucleus O which we take to be the origin as shown in Figure 9.4b. As the electrons are “pushed” away by the applied field, the Coulombic attraction between
the electrons and nuclear charge “pulls in” the electrons. The force on the electrons,

due to E, trying to separate them away from the nuclear charge is ZeE. The restoring force Fr, which is the Coulombic attractive force between the electrons and
the nucleus, can be taken to be proportional to the displacement x provided that
the latter is small. The reason is that Fr = Fr(x) can be expanded in powers of x,
and for small x only the linear term matters. The restoring force Fr is obviously
zero when C coincides with O (x = 0). We can write Fr = −βx where β is a
constant and the negative sign indicates that Fr is always directed toward the
nucleus O.
First consider applying a dc field. In equilibrium, the net force on the negative
charge is zero or ZeE = βx from which x is known. Therefore, the magnitude of the
induced electronic dipole moment is given by
pinduced = (Ze)x =

Z2e2
E
β

[9.9]

As expected pinduced is proportional to the applied field. The electronic dipole
moment in Equation 9.9 is valid under static conditions, i.e., when the electric field
is a dc field. Suppose that we suddenly remove the applied electric field polarizing
the atom. There is then only the restoring force −βx, which always acts to pull the
electrons toward the nucleus O. The equation of motion of the negative charge center is then (force = mass × acceleration)
−βx = Zme

d 2x

By solving this differential equation we can show that the displacement at any
time is a simple harmonic motion, that is,
x(t) = xo cos(ωot)

where the angular frequency of oscillation ωo is
Natural

ωo = (

[9.10]

In essence, this is the oscillation frequency of the center of mass of the electron
cloud about the nucleus and xo is the displacement before the removal of the field.
After the removal of the field, the electronic charge cloud executes simple harmonic
motion about the nucleus with a natural frequency ωo determined by Equation 9.10;
ωo is also called the resonance frequency. The oscillations, of course, die out with
time because there is an inevitable loss of energy from an oscillating charge cloud.
An oscillating electron is like an oscillating current and loses energy by radiating
EM waves; all accelerating charges emit radiation.
Consider now the presence of an oscillating electric field due to an EM wave
passing through the location of this atom as in Figure 9.4b. The applied field oscillates harmonically in the +x and −x directions, that is, E = Eo exp(jωt). This field
will drive and oscillate the electrons about the nucleus. There is again a restoring
force Fr acting on the displaced electrons trying to bring back the electron shell to
its equilibrium placement around the nucleus. For simplicity we will again neglect

The induced electronic dipole moment is then simply given by pinduced = −(Ze)x.
The negative sign is needed because normally x is measured from negative to
positive charge whereas in Figure 9.4b it is measured from the nucleus. By definition, the electronic polarizability αe is the induced dipole moment per unit electric field,
αe =

Ze2

me (ωo2 − ω2 )

[9.12]

Thus, the displacement x and hence electronic polarizability αe increase as ω
increases. Both become very large when ω approaches the natural frequency ωo.
In practice, charge separation x and hence polarizability αe do not become infinite
at ω = ωo because two factors impose a limit. First, at large x, the system is no longer linear and this analysis is not valid. Secondly, there is always some energy loss.
Given that the polarizability is frequency dependent as in Equation 9.12, the
effect on the refractive index n is easy to predict. The simplest (and a very rough)
relationship between the relative permittivity εr and polarizability αe is
N
εr = 1 + αe
εo

where N is the number of atoms per unit volume. Given that the refractive index n
is related to εr by n2 = εr, it is clear that n must be frequency dependent, i.e.,

We can also express this in terms of the wavelength λ. If λo = 2πc∕ωo is the

This type of relationship between n and the frequency ω, or wavelength λ, is
called the dispersion relation. Although the above treatment is grossly simplified, it does nonetheless emphasize that n will always be wavelength dependent
and will exhibit a substantial increase as the frequency increases toward a natural
frequency of the polarization mechanism. In the above example, we considered

to consider the valence electrons in the bonds. The overall result is that n is a
complicated function of the frequency or the wavelength. One possibility is to
assume a number of resonant frequencies, that is, not just λo but a series of resonant frequencies, λ1, λ2, . . . , and then sum the contributions arising from each

Equation 9.15 turns out to be quite a useful semiempirical expression for calculating
n at various wavelengths if the Sellmeier coefficients are known. Higher terms
involving A4 and higher A coefficients can generally be neglected in representing n
versus λ behavior over typical wavelengths of interest. For example, for diamond,
we only need the A1 and A2 terms. The Sellmeier coefficients are listed in various
optical data handbooks.

GROUP VELOCITY AND GROUP INDEX

Since there are no perfect monochromatic waves in practice, we have to consider the
way in which a group of waves differing slightly in wavelength will travel along the
z direction as depicted in Figure 9.5. When two perfectly harmonic waves of frequencies ω − δω and ω + δω and wavevectors k − δk and k + δk interfere, as shown in
Figure 9.5, they generate a wavepacket which contains an oscillating field at the mean
frequency ω that is amplitude modulated by a slowly varying field of frequency δω.
The maximum amplitude moves with a wavevector δk and thus with a group velocity
that is given by δω∕δk, that is,
Group

vg =

[9.19]

The group velocity therefore defines the speed with which energy or information
is propagated since it defines the speed of the envelope of the amplitude variation.

waves traveling in the same direction result in a
wave packet that has an amplitude variation that
travels at the group velocity.

The maximum electric field in Figure 9.5 advances with a velocity vg, whereas the
phase variations in the electric field are propagating at the phase velocity v.
In a vacuum, obviously v is simply c and independent of the wavelength or k. Thus
for waves traveling in a vacuum, ω = ck and the group velocity is
vg (vacuum) =

dω
= c = Phase velocity
dk

[9.20]

For a wave in a medium, k in Equation 9.19 is the propagation constant within
the medium, that is, k = 2πn∕λ, where λ is the free space wavelength. Further, v
depends on the wavelength by virtue of n being a function of the wavelength as in
the case for glasses. Then,

is defined as the group index of the medium. Equation 9.23 defines the group

group velocity via Equation 9.22.
In general, for many materials the refractive index n and hence the group index
Ng depend on the wavelength of light by virtue of the relative permittivity εr being
frequency dependent. Then both the phase velocity v and the group velocity vg depend
on the wavelength and the medium is called a dispersive medium. The refractive
index n and the group index Ng of pure SiO2 (silica) glass are important parameters
in optical fiber design in optical communications. Both of these parameters depend
on the wavelength of light as shown in Figure 9.6. Around 1300 nm, Ng is at a
minimum which means that for wavelengths close to 1300 nm, Ng is wavelength
independent. Thus, light waves with wavelengths around 1300 nm travel with the same
group velocity and do not experience dispersion. This phenomenon is significant in
the propagation of light in glass fibers used in optical communications.

GROUP VELOCITY Consider two sinusoidal waves which are close in frequency, that is,
waves of frequencies ω − δω and ω + δω as in Figure 9.5. Their wavevectors will be k − δk
and k + δk. The resultant wave will be
Ex(z, t) = Eo cos[(ω − δω)t − (k − δk)z] + Eo cos[(ω + δω)t − (k + δk)z]

By using the trigonometric identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[ 21 (A − B)] cos[ 21 (A + B)] we
arrive at
Ex(z, t) = 2Eo cos[(δω)t − (δk)z] cos[ωt − kz]

As depicted in Figure 9.5, this represents a sinusoidal wave of frequency ω which is
amplitude modulated by a very slowly varying sinusoidal of frequency δω. The system of
waves, that is, the modulation, travels along z at a speed determined by the modulating term
cos[(δω)t − (δk)z]. The maximum in the field occurs when [(δω)t − (δk)z] = 2mπ = constant

REFRACTIVE AND GROUP INDEX OF Si AT 1550 nm Silicon photonic endeavors to integrate various photonic functionalities such as light guiding, light modulation, detection, etc.,
into the silicon microelectronics. Calculate the refractive and group index of Si at 1550 nm,
one of the main communication wavelengths.
SOLUTION

The 1550 nm wavelength is equivalent to a photon energy in eV of
hf = hc∕λ = (6.626 × 10−34)(3 × 108)∕(1550 × 10−9)(1.602 × 10−19) = 0.800 eV

Using the Cauchy dispersion relation for Si with coefficients from Table 9.2,
n = n−2(hf )−2 + n0 + n2(hf )2 + n4(hf )4
= (−2.04 × 10−8)(0.800)−2 + 3.4189 + (8.15 × 10−2)(0.800)2 + (1.25 × 10−2)(0.800)4
= 3.4711

We can obtain the group index through Equation 9.23. We can change this equation from
wavelength λ dependence to photon energy hf dependence by using hf = hc∕λ. From straightforward calculus, the result is
Ng = n − λ

dn
dn
= n + (hf )
dλ
d(hf )

Differentiating the Cauchy relation and substituting it into the above, we obtain
Ng = −n−2(hf )−2 + n0 + 3n2(hf )2 + 5n4(hf )4

Substituting hf = 0.800 eV we find
Ng = −(−2.04 × 10−8)(0.800)−2 + 3.4189 + 3(8.15 × 10−2)(0.800)2 + 5(1.25 × 10−2)(0.800)4
= 3.5756

Ng is about 3 percent smaller than n. Sometimes the empirical expression for n is not as
easy to differentiate analytically as above, in which case we can simply find Ng by numerically differentiating n by calculating n and n + δn at two very closely spaced wavelengths λ
and λ + δλ.

where v = (εoεr μo)−1∕2 and n = √εr . Thus, the two fields are simply and intimately
related for an EM wave propagating in an isotropic medium. Any process that alters
Ex also intimately changes By in accordance with Equation 9.24.
As the EM wave propagates in the direction of the wavevector k as shown in
Figure 9.7, there is an energy flow in this direction. The wave brings with it electromagnetic energy. A small region of space where the electric field is Ex has an
energy density, that is, energy per unit volume, given by 12εoεrE2x . Similarly, a region
of space where the magnetic field is By has an energy density 12B2y ∕μo . Since the two
fields are related by Equation 9.24, the energy densities in the Ex and By fields are
the same,

The total energy density in the wave is therefore εoεr E2x. Suppose that an ideal
“energy meter” is placed in the path of the EM wave so that the receiving area A of
this meter is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In a time interval Δt, a
portion of the wave of spatial length v Δt crosses A as shown in Figure 9.7. Thus,
a volume Av Δt of the EM wave crosses A in time Δt. The energy in this volume
consequently becomes received. If S is the EM power flow per unit area,
S = Energy flow per unit time per unit area

This is actually a statement of Faraday’s law for EM waves. In vector notation it is often expressed as ωB = k × E.

9.6

SNELL’S LAW AND TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION (TIR)

875

In an isotropic medium, the energy flow is in the direction of wave propagation.
If we use the vectors E and B to represent the electric and magnetic fields in the
EM wave, then the wave propagates in a direction E × B, because this direction is
perpendicular to both E and B. The EM power flow per unit area in Equation 9.26
can be written as
S = v2εoεr E × B

[9.27]

where S, called the Poynting vector, represents the energy flow per unit time per
unit area in a direction determined by E × B (direction of propagation). Its magnitude, power flow per unit area, is called the irradiance.7
The field Ex at the receiver location (say, z = z1) varies sinusoidally which means
that the energy flow also varies sinusoidally. The irradiance in Equation 9.26 is the
instantaneous irradiance. If we write the field as Ex = Eo sin(ωt) and then calculate
the average irradiance by averaging S over one period, we would find the average
irradiance,

The instantaneous irradiance can only be measured if the power meter can
respond more quickly than the oscillations of the electric field, and since this is in
the optical frequencies range, all practical measurements invariably yield the average
irradiance because all detectors have a response rate much slower than the frequency
of the wave.

SNELL’S LAW AND TOTAL INTERNAL
REFLECTION (TIR)

We consider a traveling plane EM wave in a medium (1) of refractive index n1
propagating toward a medium (2) with a refractive index n2. Constant phase fronts
are joined with broken lines, and the wavevector ki is perpendicular to the wave
fronts as shown in Figure 9.8. When the wave reaches the plane boundary between
the two media, a transmitted wave in medium 2 and a reflected wave in medium
1 appear. The transmitted wave is called the refracted light. The angles, θi, θt, θr
define the directions of the incident, transmitted, and reflected waves, respectively, with
respect to the normal to the boundary plane as shown in Figure 9.8. The wavevectors
of the reflected and transmitted waves are denoted as kr and kt, respectively. Since
7
The term intensity is widely used and interpreted by many engineers as power flow per unit area even though
the strictly correct term is irradiance. Many optoelectronic data books simply use intensity to mean irradiance.

both the incident and reflected waves are in the same medium, the magnitudes of kr
and ki are the same, kr = ki.
Simple arguments based on constructive interference can be used to show that
there can only be one reflected wave that occurs at an angle equal to the incidence
angle. The two waves along Ai and Bi are in phase. When these waves are reflected
to become waves Ar and Br, then they must still be in phase, otherwise they will
interfere destructively and destroy each other. The only way the two waves can stay
in phase is if θr = θi. All other angles lead to the waves Ar and Br being out of phase
and interfering destructively.
The refracted waves At and Bt are propagating in a medium of refracted index
n2 (< n1) that is different than n1. Hence the waves At and Bt have different velocities
than Ai and Bi. We consider what happens to a wavefront such as AB, corresponding
perhaps to the maximum field, as it propagates from medium 1 to 2. We recall that
the points A and B on this front are always in phase. During the time it takes for
the phase B on wave Bi to reach B′, phase A on wave At has progressed to A′. The
wavefront AB thus becomes the front A′B′ in medium 2. Unless the two waves at A′
and B′ still have the same phase, there will be no transmitted wave. A′ and B′ points
on the front are only in phase for one particular transmitted angle θt.
If it takes time t for the phase at B on wave Bi to reach B′, then BB′ = v1t =
ct∕n1. During this time t, the phase A has progressed to A′ where AA′ = v2t = ct∕n2.
A′ and B′ belong to the same front just like A and B, so AB is perpendicular to ki
in medium 1 and A′B′ is perpendicular to kt in medium 2. From geometrical

Snell’s law

This is Snell’s law8 which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the
refractive indices of the media.
If we consider the reflected wave, the wave front AB becomes A″B′ in the
reflected wave. In time t, phase B moves to B′ and A moves to A″. Since they must
still be in phase to constitute the reflected wave, BB′ must be equal to AA″. Suppose
it takes time t for the wavefront B to move to B′ (or A to A″). Then, since BB′ =
AA″ = v1t, from geometrical considerations,
AB′ =

EXAMPLE 9.8

OPTICAL FIBERS IN COMMUNICATIONS Figure 9.10 shows a simplified view of a modern
optical communications system. Information is converted into a digital signal (e.g., current
pulses) which drives a light emitter such as a semiconductor laser. The light pulses from the
emitter are coupled into an optical fiber, which acts as a light guide. The optical fiber is a
very thin glass fiber [made of silica (SiO2)], almost as thin as your hair, that is able to optically guide the light pulses to their destination. The photodetector at the destination converts
the light pulses into an electric signal, which is then decoded into the original information.
The core of the optical fiber has a higher refractive index than the surrounding region, which
is called the cladding as shown in Figure 9.10. Optical fibers for short-distance applications (e.g.,
communications in local area networks within a large building) usually have a core region that
has a diameter of about 100 μm, and the whole fiber would be about 150–200 μm in diameter. The

core and cladding refractive indices, n1 and n2, respectively, are normally only 1–3 percent different. The light propagates along the fiber core because light rays experience total internal
reflections at the core–cladding interface as shown in Figure 9.10. Only those light rays that can
exercise TIR travel along the fiber length and can reach the destination. Consider a fiber with

AMPLITUDE REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS

Although the ray picture with constant phase wave fronts is useful in understanding
refraction and reflection, to obtain the magnitude of the reflected and refracted waves
and their relative phases, we need to consider the electric field in the light wave. The
electric field in the wave must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation as
shown in Figure 9.11. We can resolve the field Ei of the incident wave into two components, one in the plane of incidence Ei,∥ and the other perpendicular to the plane of
incidence Ei,⊥. The plane of incidence is defined as the plane containing the incident
and the reflected rays which in Figure 9.11 corresponds to the plane of the paper.10
Similarly for both the reflected and transmitted waves, we will have field components
parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, i.e., Er,∥, Er,⊥ and Et,∥, Et,⊥.
As apparent from Figure 9.11, the incident, transmitted, and reflected waves all
have a wavevector component along the z direction; that is, they have an effective
velocity along z. The fields Ei,⊥, Er,⊥, and Et,⊥ are all perpendicular to the z direction.
These waves are called transverse electric field (TE) waves. On the other hand,
waves with Ei,∥, Er,∥, and Et,∥ only have their magnetic field components perpendicular to the z direction and these are called transverse magnetic field (TM) waves.
We will describe the incident, reflected, and refracted waves by the exponential
representation of a traveling wave, i.e.,
Ei = Eio exp j(ωt − ki · r)

[9.32]

Er = Ero exp j(ωt − kr · r)

[9.33]

Et = Eto exp j(ωt − kt · r)

[9.34]

where r is the position vector; the wavevectors ki, kr, and kt describe, respectively,
the directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves; and Eio, Ero, and Eto
9

The light propagation in an optical fiber is much more complicated than the simple zigzagging of light rays
with TIRs at the core–cladding interface. The waves in the core have to satisfy not only TIR but also have to
avoid destructive interference so that they are not destroyed as they travel along the guide.

The definitions of the field components follow those of S. G. Lipson et al., Optical Physics, 3rd ed.,
Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press, 1995, and Grant Fowles, Introduction to Modern Optics, 2nd ed.,
New York, Dover Publications, Inc., 1975, whose clear treatments of this subject are highly recommended. The
majority of the authors use a different convention which leads to different signs later in the equations; Fresnel’s
equations are related to the specific electric field directions from which they are derived.

are the respective amplitudes. Any phase changes such as ϕr and ϕt in the reflected
and transmitted waves with respect to the phase of the incident wave are incorporated
into the complex amplitudes Ero and Eto. Our objective is to find Ero and Eto with
respect to Eio.
We should note that similar equations can be stated for the magnetic field components in the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves, but these will be perpendicular to the corresponding electric fields. The electric and magnetic fields anywhere
on the wave must be perpendicular to each other as a requirement of electromagnetic
wave theory. This means that with E∥ in the EM wave we have a magnetic field B⊥
associated with it such that B⊥ = (n∕c)E∥. Similarly E⊥ will have a magnetic field
B∥ associated with it such that B∥ = (n∕c)E⊥.
There are two useful fundamental rules in electromagnetism that govern the
behavior of the electric and magnetic fields at a boundary between two dielectric
media which we can arbitrarily label as 1 and 2. These rules are called boundary
conditions. The first states that the electric field that is tangential to the boundary
surface Etangential must be continuous across the boundary from medium 1 to 2, i.e.,
at the boundary y = 0 in Figure 9.11,
Boundary

Etangential(1) = Etangential(2)

The second rule is that the tangential component of the magnetic field Btangential
to the boundary must be likewise continuous from medium 1 to 2 provided that the
two media are nonmagnetic (relative permeability μr = 1),
Btangential(1) = Btangential(2)

[9.36]

Using these boundary conditions for the fields at y = 0, and the relationship
between the electric and magnetic fields, we can find the reflected and transmitted
waves in terms of the incident wave. The boundary conditions can only be satisfied
if the reflection and incidence angles are equal, θr = θi, and the angles for the transmitted and incident waves obey Snell’s law, n1 sin θi = n2 sin θr.
Applying the boundary conditions to the EM wave going from medium 1 to 2,
the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves can be readily obtained in
terms of n1, n2, and the incidence angle θi alone.11 These relationships are called
Fresnel’s equations. If we define n = n2∕n1, as the relative refractive index of
medium 2 to that of 1, then the reflection and transmission coefficients for E⊥ are

Further, the reflection and transmission coefficients are related by

and

r ⊥ + 1 = t⊥

The significance of these equations is that they allow the amplitudes and phases
of the reflected and transmitted waves to be determined from the coefficients r⊥, r∥,
t∥, and t⊥. For convenience we take Eio to be a real number so that the phase angles
of r⊥ and t⊥ correspond to the phase changes measured with respect to the incident
wave. For example, if r⊥ is a complex quantity, then we can write this as
r⊥ = ∣r⊥∣ exp(−jϕ⊥ ) where ∣r⊥∣ and ϕ⊥ represent the relative amplitude and phase of
the reflected wave with respect to the incident wave for the field perpendicular to
the plane of incidence. Of course, when r⊥ is a real quantity, then a positive number
represents no phase shift and a negative number is a phase shift of 180° (or π). As
with all waves, a negative sign corresponds to a 180° phase shift. Complex coefficients can only be obtained from Fresnel’s equations if the terms under the square
roots become negative, and this can only happen when n < 1 (or n1 > n2), and also
11

These equations are readily available in any electromagnetism textbook. Their derivation from the two boundary
conditions involves extensive algebraic manipulation which we will not carry out here. The electric and magnetic
field components on both sides of the boundary are resolved tangentially to the boundary surface and the
boundary conditions are then applied. We then use such relations as cos θt = (1 − sin θt)1 ∕ 2 and sin θt as
determined by Snell’s law, etc.

when θi > θc, the critical angle. Thus, phase changes other than 0 or 180° occur only
when there is total internal reflection.
Figure 9.12a shows how the magnitudes of the reflection coefficients ∣r⊥∣ and
∣r∥∣ vary with the incidence angle θi for a light wave traveling from a more dense
medium, n1 = 1.44, to a less dense medium, n2 = 1.00, as predicted by Fresnel’s
equations. Figure 9.12b shows the changes in the phase of the reflected wave, ϕ⊥
and ϕ∥, with θi. The critical angle θc as determined from sin θc = n2∕n1 in this case
is 44°. It is clear that for incidence close to normal (small θi), there is no phase
change in the reflected wave. For example, putting normal incidence (θi = 0) into
Fresnel’s equations, we find
Normal

r ∥ = r⊥ =

[9.42]

This is a positive quantity for n1 > n2 which means that the reflected wave suffers no phase change. This is confirmed by ϕ⊥ and ϕ∥ in Figure 9.12b. As the
incidence angle increases, eventually r∥ becomes zero at an angle of about 35°. We
can find this special incidence angle, labeled as θp, by solving the Fresnel equation,
Equation 9.39, for r∥ = 0. The field in the reflected wave is then always perpendicular to the plane of incidence and hence well-defined. This special angle is called
the polarization angle or Brewster’s angle and from Equation 9.39 is given by
tan θp =

n2
n1

[9.43]

9 .7

FRESNEL’S EQUATIONS

883

The reflected wave is then said to be linearly polarized because it contains
electric field oscillations that are contained within a well-defined plane which is
perpendicular to the plane of incidence and also to the direction of propagation.
Electric field oscillations in unpolarized light, on the other hand, can be in any one
of an infinite number of directions that are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In linearly polarized light, however, the field oscillations are contained within
a well-defined plane. Light emitted from many light sources such as a tungsten light
bulb or an LED diode is unpolarized and the field is randomly oriented in a direction
that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
For incidence angles greater than θp but smaller than θc, Fresnel’s equation,
Equation 9.39, gives a negative number for r∥ which indicates a phase shift of 180°
as shown in ϕ∥ in Figure 9.12b. The magnitudes of both r∥ and r⊥ increase with θi
as apparent in Figure 9.12a. At the critical angle and beyond (past 44° in Figure 9.12),
i.e., when θi ≥ θc, the magnitudes of both r∥ and r⊥ go to unity, so the reflected wave
has the same amplitude as the incident wave. The incident wave has suffered total
internal reflection (TIR). When θi > θc, in the presence of TIR, the Equations 9.37
to 9.40 are complex quantities because then sin θi > n and the terms under the square
roots become negative. The reflection coefficients become complex quantities of the
type r⊥ = 1 · exp(−jϕ⊥ ) and r∥ = 1 · exp(−jϕ∥) with the phase angles ϕ⊥ and ϕ∥
being other than 0 or 180°. The reflected wave therefore suffers phase changes ϕ⊥
and ϕ∥ in the components E⊥ and E∥. These phase changes depend on the incidence
angle, as apparent in Figure 9.12b, and on n1 and n2.
Examination of Equation 9.37 for r⊥ shows that for θi > θc, we have ∣r⊥∣ = 1,
but the phase change ϕ⊥ is given by

We can summarize that, in internal reflection (n1 > n2), the amplitude of the
reflected wave from TIR is equal to the amplitude of the incident wave but its phase
has shifted by an amount determined by Equations 9.44 and 9.45.12 The fact that ϕ∥
has an additional π shift which makes ϕ∥ negative for θi > θc is due to the choice
for the direction of the reflected optical field Er,∥ in Figure 9.11. (This π shift can
be ignored if we simply invert Er,∥.)
The reflection coefficients in Figure 9.12 considered the case in which n1 > n2.
When light approaches the boundary from the higher index side, that is, n1 > n2, the
reflection is said to be internal reflection and at normal incidence there is no phase
change. On the other hand, if light approaches the boundary from the lower index
side, that is, n1 < n2, then it is called external reflection. Thus in external reflection

It should be apparent that the concepts and the resulting equations apply to a well-defined linearly polarized
light wave.

light becomes reflected by the surface of an optically denser (higher refractive index)
medium. There is an important difference between the two. Figure 9.13 shows how
the reflection coefficients r⊥ and r∥ depend on the incidence angle θi for external
reflection (n1 = 1 and n2 = 1.44). At normal incidence, both coefficients are negative, which means that in external reflection at normal incidence there is a phase
shift of 180°. Further, r∥ goes through zero at the Brewster angle θp given by Equation 9.43. At this angle of incidence, the reflected wave is polarized in the E⊥ component only. Transmitted light in both internal reflection (when θi < θc) and external
reflection does not experience a phase shift.
What happens to the transmitted wave when θi > θc? According to the boundary
conditions, there must still be an electric field in medium 2; otherwise, the boundary
conditions cannot be satisfied. When θi > θc, the field in medium 2 is a wave that
travels near the surface of the boundary along the z direction as depicted in Figure 9.14.

The wave is called an evanescent wave and advances along z with its field decreasing as we move into medium 2, i.e.,
Et,⊥ (y, z, t) ∝ e−α2y exp j(ωt − kizz)

[9.46]

where λ is the free-space wavelength. According to Equation 9.46, the evanescent
wave travels along z and has an amplitude that decays exponentially as we move
from the boundary into medium 2 (along y) as shown in Figure 9.11b. The field of
the evanescent wave is e−1 in medium 2 when y = 1∕α2 = δ which is called the
penetration depth. It is not difficult to show that the evanescent wave is correctly
predicted by Snell’s law when θi > θc. The evanescent wave propagates along the
boundary (along z) with the same speed as the z component velocity of the incident
and reflected waves. In Equations 9.32 to 9.34 we had assumed that the incident and
reflected waves were plane waves, that is, of infinite extent. If we were to extend
the plane wavefronts on the reflected wave, these would cut the boundary as shown
in Figure 9.14. The evanescent wave traveling along z can be thought of as arising
from these plane wavefronts at the boundary as in Figure 9.14. (The evanescent wave
is important in light propagation in optical waveguides such as in optical fibers.) If
the incident wave is a narrow beam of light (e.g., from a laser pointer), then the
reflected beam would have the same cross section. There would still be an evanescent
wave at the boundary, but it would exist only within the cross-sectional area of the
reflected beam at the boundary.

9.7.2 INTENSITY, REFLECTANCE, AND TRANSMITTANCE
It is frequently necessary to calculate the intensity or irradiance of the reflected and
transmitted waves when light traveling in a medium of index n1 is incident at a boundary where the refractive index changes to n2. In some cases we are simply interested in
normal incidence where θi = 0°. For example, in laser diodes light is reflected from
the ends of an optical cavity where there is a change in the refractive index.
Reflectance R measures the intensity of the reflected light with respect to that of
the incident light and can be defined separately for electric field components parallel
and perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The reflectances R⊥ and R∥ are defined by
R⊥ =

∣Ero,⊥∣2
∣Eio,⊥∣

= ∣r⊥∣2
2

and R∥ =

∣Ero,∥∣2
∣Eio,∥∣2

= ∣r∥∣2

[9.48]

From Equations 9.37 to 9.40 with normal incidence, these are simply given by
R = R⊥ = R∥ =

n1 − n2 2
( n1 + n2 )

[9.49]

Since a glass medium has a refractive index of around 1.5, this means that typically
4 percent of the incident radiation on an air–glass surface will be reflected back.

Transmittance T relates the intensity of the transmitted wave to that of the incident wave in a similar fashion to the reflectance. We must, however, consider that the
transmitted wave is in a different medium and further its direction with respect to the
boundary is also different by virtue of refraction. For normal incidence, the incident
and transmitted beams are normal and the transmittances are defined and given by

The critical angle θc for TIR is given by sin θc = n2∕n1 = 1.440∕1.460, so θc = 80.51°.
Since the incidence angle θi > θc, there is a phase shift in the reflected wave. The phase
change in Er,⊥ is given by ϕ⊥ . With n1 = 1.460, n2 = 1.440, and θi = 87°,

for the refractive indices and wavelength are typical of those values found in optical fiber
communications.

a.

The light travels in air and becomes partially reflected at the surface of the glass which
corresponds to external reflection. Thus n1 = 1 and n2 = 1.5. Then,
r∥ = r⊥ =

n1 − n2 1 − 1.5

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

There is no phase shift. The reflectance is again 0.04 or 4 percent. In both cases (a) and
(b), the amount of reflected light is the same.
Light is traveling in air and is incident on the glass surface at the polarization angle.
Here n1 = 1, n2 = 1.5, and tan θp = (n2∕n1) = 1.5, so θp = 56.3°.

If we were to reflect light from a glass plate keeping the angle of incidence at 56.3°,
then the reflected light will be polarized with an electric field component perpendicular to
the plane of incidence. The transmitted light will have the field greater in the plane of incidence; that is, it will be partially polarized. By using a stack of glass plates one can increase
the polarization of the transmitted light. (This type of pile-of-plates polarizer was invented
by Dominique F. J. Arago in 1812.)

EXAMPLE 9.11

ANTIREFLECTION COATINGS ON SOLAR CELLS

When light is incident on the surface of
a semiconductor, it becomes partially reflected. Partial reflection is an important consideration in solar cells where transmitted light energy into the semiconductor device is converted
to electric energy. The refractive index of Si is about 3.5 at wavelengths around 700–800 nm.
Thus the reflectance with n1(air) = 1 and n2(Si) ≈ 3.5 is
R=(

n1 − n2 2
1 − 3.5 2
=
( 1 + 3.5 ) = 0.309
n1 + n2 )

This means that 30 percent of the light is reflected and is not available for conversion
to electric energy, a considerable reduction in the efficiency of the solar cell.
However, we can coat the surface of the semiconductor device with a thin layer of a
dielectric material such as Si3N4 (silicon nitride) that has an intermediate refractive index.
Figure 9.15 illustrates how the thin dielectric coating reduces the reflected light intensity. In
this case n1(air) = 1, n2(coating) ≈ 1.9, and n3(Si) = 3.5. Light is first incident on the air–
coating surface, and some of it becomes reflected; this reflected wave is shown as A in
Figure 9.15. Wave A has experienced a 180° phase change on reflection as this is an external
reflection. The wave that enters and travels in the coating then becomes reflected at the
coating–semiconductor surface. This wave, which is shown as B, also suffers a 180° phase
change since n3 > n2. When wave B reaches A, it has suffered a total delay of traversing the
thickness d of the coating twice. The phase difference is equivalent to kc(2d) where kc = 2π∕λc
is the wavevector in the coating and is given by 2π∕λc where λc is the wavelength in the
coating. Since λc = λ∕n2, where λ is the free-space wavelength, the phase difference Δϕ
between A and B is (2πn2∕λ)(2d). To reduce the reflected light, A and B must interfere

and depends on the wavelength.
To obtain a good degree of destructive interference between waves A and B, the two
amplitudes must be comparable. It turns out that we need n2 = √n1n3 . When n2 = √n1n3 ,
then the reflection coefficient between the air and coating is equal to that between the coating and the semiconductor. In this case we would need √3.5 or 1.87. Thus, Si3N4 is a good
choice as an antireflection coating material on Si solar cells.
Taking the wavelength to be 700 nm, d = (700 nm)∕[4(1.9)] = 92.1 nm or odd multiples of d.

A dielectric mirror consists of a stack of dielectric layers of alternating refractive indices as schematically illustrated in Figure 9.16a, where n1 is greater than
n2. The thickness of each layer is a quarter of wavelength or λlayer∕4, where λlayer
is the wavelength of light in that layer, or λo∕n where λo is the free space wavelength at which the mirror is required to reflect the incident light and n is the
refractive index of the layer. Reflected waves from the interfaces interfere constructively and give rise to a substantial reflected light over a band of wavelengths
centered around λo as shown in Figure 9.16b. If there are sufficient numbers of
layers, the reflectance can approach 100 percent at the wavelength λo. Since n1
(high) and n2 (low) layers are used in pairs, the total number of such pairs of
layers, or double layers, is denoted as N; as N increases, the reflectance also
increases. The layers are coated, by vacuum deposition techniques, on a suitable
substrate. The dielectric mirror in Figure 9.16a is also knows as a quarter-wave

dielectric stack. Figure 9.16b shows the typical reflectance versus wavelength
behavior of a particular dielectric stack that has 10 pairs of layers. The mirror has
been designed to reflect at 1.55 μm.
Consider the reflection coefficient r12 for light in layer 1 being reflected at the
1–2 boundary is r12 = (n1 − n2)∕(n1 + n2) and is a positive number, indicating no
phase change. The reflection coefficient for light in layer 2 being reflected at the
2–1 boundary is r21 = (n2 − n1)∕(n2 + n1), which is −r12 or negative, indicating a
π phase change. Thus the reflection coefficient alternates in sign through the mirror.
Consider two arbitrary waves, B and C, which are reflected at two consecutive interfaces. The two waves are therefore already out of phase by π due to reflections at
the different boundaries. Further, wave B travels an additional distance that is twice
(λ2∕4) (the thickness of layer d2) before reaching wave B and therefore experiences
a phase change equivalent to 2(λ2∕4) or λ2∕2, that is π. The phase difference between
B and C is then π + π or 2π. Thus waves B and C are in phase and interfere constructively. We can similarly show that waves C and D also interfere constructively
and so on, so that all reflected waves from the consecutive boundaries interfere
constructively. After several layers (depending on the n1∕n2 ratio), the transmitted
intensity will be very small and the reflected light intensity will be close to 100 percent
as indicated in Figure 9.16b. Dielectric mirrors are widely used in photonics, for
example, in solid state lasers such as the vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode.
Since the dielectric mirror has a periodic variation in the refractive index (the period
being d1 + d2), similar to a diffraction grating, it is sometimes referred to as a Bragg
reflector. It is left as an exercise to show that if we interchange the high and low
layers, we obtain the same result. As apparent from Figure 9.16b, there is a wavelength range Δλ in which the reflectance is maximum. This range (Δλ) is called
reflectance bandwidth; or the stop-band for the transmitted light.

COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDEX
AND LIGHT ABSORPTION

Generally when light propagates through a material, it becomes attenuated in the
direction of propagation as illustrated in Figure 9.17. We distinguish between
absorption and scattering both of which give rise to a loss of intensity in the
Figure 9.17 Attenuation of light in the direction of
propagation.

regular direction of propagation. In absorption, the loss in the power in the propagating EM wave is due to the conversion of light energy to other forms of energy,
e.g., lattice vibrations (heat) during the polarization of the molecules of the medium,
local vibrations of impurity ions, and excitation of electrons from the valence band
to the conduction band. On the other hand, scattering is a process by which the
energy from a propagating EM wave is redirected as secondary EM waves in various directions away from the original direction of propagation; this is discussed in
Section 9.11.
It is instructive to consider what happens when a monochromatic light wave
such as
E = Eo exp j(ωt − kz)

[9.52]

is propagating in a dielectric medium. The electric field E in Equation 9.52 is either
parallel to x or y since propagation is along z. As the wave travels through the
medium, the molecules become polarized. This polarization effect is represented by
the relative permittivity εr of the medium. If there were no losses in the polarization
process, then the relative permittivity εr would be a real number and the corresponding refractive index n = √εr would also be a real number. However, we know that
there are always some losses in all polarization processes. For example, when the
ions of an ionic crystal are displaced from their equilibrium positions by an alternating electric field and made to oscillate, some of the energy from the electric field
is coupled and converted to lattice vibrations (intuitively, “sound” and heat). These
losses are generally accounted for by describing the whole medium in terms of a
complex relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) εr, that is,
εr = ε′r − jε″r

[9.53]

where the real part ε′r determines the polarization of the medium with losses ignored
and the imaginary part ε″r describes the losses in the medium. For a lossless medium,
obviously εr = ε′r. The loss ε″r depends on the frequency of the wave and usually
peaks at certain natural (resonant) frequencies. If the medium has a finite conductivity (e.g., due to a small number of conduction electrons), then there will be a Joule
loss due to the electric field in the wave driving these conduction electrons. This
type of light attenuation is called free carrier absorption. In such cases we can
describe the medium as having a complex relative permittivity as in Equation 9.53
but with the imaginary (loss) part ε″r determined by the real part of the ac conductivity σac of the medium at the frequency of the wave. We know from Chapter 2 that
the conductivity itself depends on the frequency of the field, and the real part of σac,
written as Re(σac), represents the Joule loss. In a medium with Joule loss only, ε″r is
then related to Re(σac) by13
ε″r =

The exact derivation involves solving Maxwell’s wave equation in a medium in which there are free charge
carriers, beyond the scope of this book. However, Equation 9.54 is intuitively almost obvious from Equation 7.30
in Chapter 7 and Figure 7.14. GP represents the real part of the admittance in Figure 7.14, so it must be A
Re(σac) ∕d, and equating this to Equation 7.30 leads directly to Equation 9.54. Remember that in the present case
we are representing conduction losses (finite σ) within the imaginary part ε″r.

where σac is the ac conductivity of the medium, and Re(σac) is its real part, and
depends on the frequency.
An EM wave that is traveling in a medium and experiencing attenuation due to
absorption can be generally described by a complex propagation constant k, that is,
k = k′ − jk″

[9.55]

where k′ and k″ are the real and imaginary parts. If we put Equation 9.55 into Equation 9.52, we will find the following,

Attenuated
propagation

E = Eo exp(−k″z) exp j(ωt − k′z)

The amplitude decays exponentially while the wave propagates along z. The real
k′ part of the complex propagation constant (wavevector) describes the propagation
characteristics, e.g., phase velocity v = ω∕k′. The imaginary k″ part describes the
rate of attenuation along z. The intensity I at any point along z is
I ∝ ∣E∣2 ∝ exp(−2k″z)

N = n − jK = √εr = √ε′r − jε″r

Optical properties of materials are typically reported either by showing the frequency dependences of n and K or ε′r and ε″r . Clearly we can use Equation 9.60 to
obtain one set of properties from the other. Figure 9.18 shows the real (n) and
imaginary (K) parts of the complex refractive index of amorphous silicon (noncrystalline form of Si) as a function of photon energy (hf ). For photon energies below
the bandgap energy, K is negligible and n is close to 3.5. Both n and K change
strongly as the photon energy increases far beyond the bandgap energy.
If we know the frequency dependence of the real part ε′r of the relative permittivity of a material, we can also determine the frequency dependence of the imaginary part ε″r , and vice versa. This may seem remarkable, but it is true provided that
we know the frequency dependence of either the real or imaginary part over as wide
a range of frequencies as possible (ideally from dc to infinity) and the material is
linear, i.e., it has a relative permittivity that is independent of the applied field; the
polarization response must be linearly proportional to the applied field.14 The relationships that relate the real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity are called
Kramers–Kronig relations. If ε′r(ω) and ε″r (ω) represent the frequency dependences
of the real and imaginary parts, respectively, then one can be determined from the
other as depicted schematically in Figure 9.19.

In addition, the material system should be passive—contain no sources of energy.

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

The optical properties n and K can be determined by measuring the reflectance
from the surface of a material as a function of polarization and the angle of incidence
(based on Fresnel’s equations).
It is instructive to mention that the reflection and transmission coefficients that
we derived in Section 9.7 were based on using a real refractive index, that is, neglecting losses. We can still use the reflection and transmission coefficients if we simply
use the complex refractive index N instead of n. For example, consider a light wave
traveling in free space incident on a material at normal incidence (θi = 90°). The

EXAMPLE 9.12

COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDEX Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on a silicon
crystal at a wavelength of 826.6 nm show that the real and imaginary parts of the complex
relative permittivity are 13.488 and 0.038, respectively. Find the complex refractive index,
the reflectance and the absorption coefficient α at this wavelength, and the phase velocity.
SOLUTION

We know that ε′r = 13.488 and ε″r = 0.038. Thus, from Equation 9.60, we have
n2 − K 2 = 13.488

and

2nK = 0.038

We can take K from the second equation and substitute for it in the first equation,
n2 − (

0.038 2
= 13.488
2n )

This is a quadratic equation in n2 that can be easily solved on a calculator to find n = 3.67.
Once we know n, we can find K = 0.038∕2n = 0.00517. If we simply take the square root
of the real part of εr, we would still find n = 3.67, because the extinction coefficient K is
small. The reflectance of the Si crystal is

= 0.327

which is the same as simply using (n − 1)2∕(n + 1)2 = 0.327, because K is small.
The absorption coefficient α describes the loss in the light intensity I via I = Io exp(−αz).
By virtue of Equation 9.57,

COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDEX AND RESONANCE ABSORPTION

Equation 9.12 is a
simple expression for the electronic polarizability αe due to an oscillating field. It is based
on the Lorentz model in which there is a restoring force acting against polarization of the
atom or the molecule. ωo is a resonant frequency, or a natural frequency, associated with this
type of electronic polarization. The same type of expression will also apply to ionic polarization, except that the resonant frequency ωo will be lower, and the mass me has to be changed to
an effective mass of the ions.15 In practice there will be some loss mechanism that absorbs
energy from the oscillating field and dissipates it. For example, in ionic polarization, this
15

Both electronic and ionic polarizabilities have similar expressions. The ionic polarizability in an oscillating field
was derived in Chapter 7, and Equation 7.90 looks almost exactly like Equation 9.66.

9.8

COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDEX AND LIGHT ABSORPTION

would involve energy transfer from light to lattice vibrations. In mechanics it is well known
that the loss forces (frictional forces) are always proportional to the velocity dx∕dt. If we
include the energy loss in ac polarization, Equation 9.11 would have an additional term −γ
dx∕dt on the right-hand side. If we then follow the same steps to obtain αe, we would find

in Equation 9.68. Notice how n and the extinction coefficient K peak close to ω = ωo.
The reflectance from Equation 9.62 is plotted in Figure 9.20b as R versus ω∕ωo. It is
apparent that R reaches its maximum value at a frequency slightly above ω = ωo, and then
remains high until ω reaches nearly 3ωo; the reflectance is substantial while absorption is
strong. It may seem strange that the crystal is both highly reflecting and highly absorbing.
The light that is incident is strongly reflected, and the light that is inside the crystal becomes
strongly absorbed. This phenomenon is known as infrared reflectance, and occurs over a band
of frequencies, called the Reststrahlen band; in the present case from ωo to roughly 3ωo.

9.9

LATTICE ABSORPTION

In optical absorption, some of the energy from the propagating EM wave is converted
to other forms of energy, for example, to heat by the generation of lattice vibrations.
There are a number of absorption processes that dissipate the energy from the wave.
One important mechanism is called lattice absorption (Reststrahlen absorption)
and involves the vibrations of the lattice atoms as illustrated in Figure 9.21. The
crystal in this example consists of ions, and as an EM wave propagates it displaces
the oppositely charged ions in opposite directions and forces them to vibrate at the
frequency of the wave. In other words, the medium experiences ionic polarization.
It is the displacements of these ions that give rise to ionic polarization and its contribution to the relative permittivity εr. As the ions and hence the lattice is made to
vibrate by the passing EM wave, as shown in Figure 9.21, some energy is coupled
into the natural lattice vibrations of the solid. This energy peaks when the frequency
of the wave is close to the natural lattice vibration frequencies. Typically these frequencies are in the infrared region. Most of the energy is then absorbed from the
EM wave and converted to lattice vibrational energy (heat). We associate this absorption with the resonance peak or relaxation peak of ionic polarization loss (imaginary
part of the relative permittivity ε″r ).
Figure 9.22 shows the infrared resonance absorption peaks in the extinction
coefficient K versus wavelength characteristics of a CdTe crystal, which has substantial
ionic bonding. The absorption peak in Figure 9.22 is usually called a Reststrahlen
band because absorption occurs over a band of frequencies (even though the band

we were to plot the reflectance (R) versus wavelength, it would be similar to that
shown in Figure 9.20b, and the band would be identified with the high reflectance
region.
Although Figure 9.21 depicts an ionic solid to visualize absorption due to lattice
waves, energy from a passing EM wave can also be absorbed by various ionic impurities in a medium as these charges can couple to the electric field and oscillate.
Bonding between an oscillating ion and the neighboring atoms causes the mechanical oscillations of the ion to be coupled to neighboring atoms. This leads to a generation of lattice waves which takes away energy from the EM wave.

GaAs and CdTe. Consider CdTe. Calculate the absorption coefficient α and the reflectance
R of CdTe at the Reststrahlen peak, and also at 50 μm and at 100 μm. What is your conclusion?

Repeating the above calculations at λ = 50 μm, we get α = 8.3 × 102 m−1, and R = 0.11

approach the resonant peak. At λ = 100 μm, α = 6.3 × 103 m−1 and R = 0.31 or 31 percent,
which is again smaller than the peak reflectance. R is maximum around the Reststrahlen peak.

BAND-TO-BAND ABSORPTION

The photon absorption process for photogeneration, that is, the creation of electron–
hole pairs (EHPs), requires the photon energy to be at least equal to the bandgap
energy Eg of the semiconductor material to excite an electron from the valence band
(VB) to the conduction band (CB). The upper cut-off wavelength (or the threshold
wavelength) λg for photogenerative absorption is therefore determined by the bandgap energy Eg of the semiconductor, so h(c∕λg) = Eg or

and bandgap

λg (μm) =

[9.70]

For example, for Si, Eg = 1.12 eV and λg is 1.11 μm whereas for Ge, Eg =
0.66 eV and the corresponding λg = 1.87 μm. It is clear that Si photodiodes cannot
be used for optical communications at 1.3 and 1.55 μm, whereas Ge photodiodes are
commercially available for use at these wavelengths. Table 9.3 lists some typical
bandgap energies and the corresponding cut-off wavelengths of various photodiode
semiconductor materials.
Incident photons with wavelengths shorter than λg become absorbed as they
travel in the semiconductor, and the light intensity, which is proportional to the
number of photons, decays exponentially with distance into the semiconductor. The
light intensity I at a distance x from the semiconductor surface is given by

where Io is the intensity of the incident radiation and α is the absorption coefficient

is a material property. Most of the photon absorption (63%) occurs over a distance
1∕α, and 1∕α is called the penetration depth δ. Figure 9.23 shows the α versus λ

characteristics of various semiconductors where it is apparent that the behavior of α
with the wavelength λ depends on the semiconductor material.
Absorption in semiconductors can be understood in terms of the behavior of the
electron energy (E) with the electron momentum (ħk) in the crystal, called the crystal
momentum. If k is the wavevector of the electron’s wavefunction in the crystal, then
the momentum of the electron within the crystal is ħk. E versus ħk behaviors for electrons in the conduction and valence bands of direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors are shown in Figure 9.24a and b, respectively. In direct bandgap semiconductors

902

CHAPTER 9

∙

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

such as III–V semiconductors (e.g., GaAs, InAs, InP, GaP) and in many of their
alloys (e.g., InGaAs, GaAsSb) the photon absorption process is a direct process
which requires no assistance from lattice vibrations. The photon is absorbed and the
electron is excited directly from the valence band to the conduction band without a
change in its k-vector, or its crystal momentum ħk, inasmuch as the photon momentum is very small. The change in the electron momentum from the valence to the
conduction band is
ħkCB − ħkVB = Photon momentum ≈ 0
This process corresponds to a vertical transition on the electron energy (E) versus electron momentum (ħk) diagram as shown in Figure 9.24a. The absorption
coefficient of these semiconductors rises sharply with decreasing wavelength from
λg as apparent for GaAs and InP in Figure 9.23.
In indirect bandgap semiconductors such as Si and Ge, the photon absorption
for photon energies near Eg requires the absorption and emission of lattice vibrations,
that is, phonons,16 during the absorption process as shown in Figure 9.24. If K is the
wavevector of a lattice wave (lattice vibrations travel in the crystal), then ħK represents the momentum associated with such a lattice vibration; that is, ħK is a phonon
momentum. When an electron in the valence band is excited to the conduction band,
there is a change in its momentum in the crystal, and this change in the momentum
cannot be supplied by the momentum of the incident photon which is very small.
Thus, the momentum difference must be balanced by a phonon momentum,
ħkCB − ħkVB = Phonon momentum = ħK

The absorption process is said to be indirect as it depends on lattice vibrations
which in turn depend on the temperature. Since the interaction of a photon with a
valence electron needs a third body, a lattice vibration, the probability of photon
absorption is not as high as in a direct transition. Furthermore, the cut-off wavelength
is not as sharp as for direct bandgap semiconductors. During the absorption process,
a phonon may be absorbed or emitted. If fpn is the frequency of the lattice vibrations,
then the phonon energy is hfpn. The photon energy is hf where f is the photon frequency. Conservation of energy requires that
hf = Eg ± hfpn

Thus, the onset of absorption does not exactly coincide with Eg, but typically it
is very close to Eg inasmuch as hfpn is small (< 0.1 eV). The absorption coefficient
initially rises slowly with decreasing wavelength from about λg as apparent in
Figure 9.23 for Si and Ge.
EXAMPLE 9.17

FUNDAMENTAL ABSORPTION A GaAs infrared LED emits at about 860 nm. A Si photodetector is to be used to detect this radiation. What should be the thickness of the Si crystal
that absorbs most of this radiation?
16

As much as an electromagnetic radiation is quantized in terms of photons, lattice vibrations in the crystal are
quantized in terms of phonons. A phonon is a quantum of lattice vibration. If K is the wavevector of a vibrational
wave in a crystal lattice and ω is its angular frequency, then the momentum of the wave is ħK and its energy
is ħω.

LIGHT SCATTERING IN MATERIALS

Scattering of an EM wave implies that a portion of the energy in a light beam is
directed away from the original direction of propagation as illustrated for a small
dielectric particle scattering a light beam in Figure 9.25. There are various types of
scattering processes.
Consider what happens when a propagating wave encounters a molecule, or a
small dielectric particle (or region), which is smaller than the wavelength. The electric field in the wave polarizes the particle by displacing the lighter electrons with
respect to the heavier positive nuclei. The electrons in the molecule couple and
oscillate with the electric field in the wave (ac electronic polarization). The oscillation of charge “up” and “down,” or the oscillation of the induced dipole, radiates
EM waves all around the molecule as depicted in Figure 9.25. We should remember
that an oscillating charge is like an alternating current which always radiates EM
waves (like an antenna). The net effect is that the incident wave becomes partially
reradiated in different directions and hence loses intensity in its original direction of
propagation. We may think of the process as the particle absorbing some of the
energy via electronic polarization and reradiating it in different directions. It may be
thought that the scattered waves constitute a spherical wave emanating from the
scattering molecule, but this is not generally the case as the reemitted radiation
depends on the shape and polarizability of the molecule in different directions. We
assumed a small particle so that at any time the field has no spatial variation through
the particle, whose polarization then oscillates with the electric field oscillation.

The field forces dipole oscillations in the

emission of EM waves in “many” directions so
that a portion of the light energy is directed
away from the incident beam.

904

CHAPTER 9

∙

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

Whenever the size of the scattering region, whether an inhomogeneity or a small
particle or a molecule, is much smaller than the wavelength λ of the incident wave,
the scattering process is generally termed Rayleigh scattering. In this type of scattering, typically the particle size is smaller than one-tenth of the wavelength.
Rayleigh scattering of waves in a medium arises whenever there are small inhomogeneous regions in which the refractive index is different than the medium (which
has some average refractive index). This means a local change in the relative permittivity and polarizability. The result is that the small inhomogeneous region acts like
a small dielectric particle and scatters the propagating wave in different directions.
In the case of optical fibers, dielectric inhomogeneities arise from fluctuations in the
relative permittivity that is part of the intrinsic glass structure. As the fiber is drawn
by freezing a liquid-like flow, random thermodynamic fluctuations in the composition and structure that occur in the liquid state become frozen into the solid structure.
Consequently, the glass fiber has small fluctuations in the relative permittivity which
leads to Rayleigh scattering. Nothing can be done to eliminate Rayleigh scattering
in glasses as it is part of their intrinsic structure.
It is apparent that the scattering process involves electronic polarization of the
molecule or the dielectric particle. We know that this process couples most of the
energy at ultraviolet frequencies where the dielectric loss due to electronic polarization is maximum and the loss is due to EM wave radiation. Therefore, as the frequency of light increases, the scattering becomes more severe. In other words,
scattering decreases with increasing wavelength. For example, blue light which has
a shorter wavelength than red light is scattered more strongly by air molecules. When
we look at the sun directly, it appears yellow because the blue light has been scattered in the direct light more than the red light. When we look at the sky in any
direction but the sun, our eyes receive scattered light which appears blue; hence the
sky is blue. At sunrise and sunset, the rays from the sun have to traverse the longest
distance through the atmosphere and have the most blue light scattered which gives
the sun its red color at these times.

9.12

ATTENUATION IN OPTICAL FIBERS

As light propagates through an optical fiber, it becomes attenuated by a number
of processes that depend on the wavelength of light. Figure 9.26 shows the attenuation coefficient, as dB per km, of a typical silica-glass-based optical fiber as a
function of wavelength. The sharp increase in the attenuation at wavelengths
beyond 1.6 μm in the infrared region is due to energy absorption by “lattice vibrations” of the constituent ions of the glass material. Fundamentally, energy absorption in this region corresponds to the stretching of the Si–O bonds in ionic
polarization induced by the EM wave. Absorption increases with wavelength as
we approach the resonance wavelength of the Si–O bond which is around 9 μm.
In the case of Ge–O glasses, this is further away, around 11 μm. There is another
intrinsic material absorption in the region below 500 nm, not shown in Figure 9.26,
which is due to photons exciting electrons from the valence band to the conduction
band of the glass.

Figure 9.26 Illustration of typical attenuation
versus wavelength characteristics of a
silica-based optical fiber.
There are two communications channels at
1310 and 1550 nm.

There is a marked attenuation peak centered at 1.4 μm, and a barely discernible
minor peak at about 1.24 μm. These attenuation regions arise from the presence of
hydroxyl ions as impurities in the glass structure inasmuch as it is difficult to remove
all traces of hydroxyl (water) products during fiber production. Further, hydrogen atoms
can easily diffuse into the glass structure at high temperatures during production which
leads to the formation of hydrogen bonds in the silica structure and OH ions. Energy
is absorbed mainly by the stretching vibrations of the OH bonds within the silica structure which has a fundamental resonance in the infrared region (beyond 2.7 μm) but
overtones or harmonics at lower wavelengths (or higher frequencies). The first overtone
at around 1.4 μm is the most significant as can be seen in Figure 9.26. The second
overtone is around 1 μm, and in high-quality fibers this is negligible. A combination
of the first overtone of the OH vibration and the fundamental vibrational frequency of
SiO2 gives rise to a minor loss peak at around 1.24 μm. There are two important windows in the attenuation versus wavelength behavior where the attenuation exhibits
minima. The window at around 1.3 μm is the region between two neighboring OH−
absorption peaks. This window is widely used in optical communications at 1310 nm.
The window at around 1.55 μm is between the first harmonic absorption of OH− and
the infrared lattice absorption tail and represents the lowest attenuation. Current technological drive is to use this window for long-haul communications. It can be seen that
it is important to keep the hydroxyl content in the fiber within tolerable levels.
There is a background attenuation process that decreases with wavelength and
is due to the Rayleigh scattering of light by the local variations in the refractive
index. Glass has a noncrystalline or an amorphous structure which means that there
is no long-range order to the arrangement of the atoms but only a short-range order,
typically a few bond lengths. The glass structure is as if the structure of the melt
has been suddenly frozen. We can only define the number of bonds a given atom in
the structure will have. Random variations in the bond angle from atom to atom lead
to a disordered structure. There is therefore a random local variation in the density
over a few bond lengths which leads to fluctuations in the refractive index over few

906

∙

CHAPTER 9

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

atomic lengths. These random fluctuations in the refractive index give rise to light
scattering and hence light attenuation along the fiber. It should be apparent that since
a degree of structural randomness is an intrinsic property of the glass structure, this
scattering process is unavoidable and represents the lowest attenuation possible
through a glass medium. As one may surmise, attenuation by scattering in a medium
is minimum for light propagating through a “perfect” crystal. In this case the only
scattering mechanisms will be due to thermodynamic defects (vacancies) and the
random thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms.
As mentioned above, the Rayleigh scattering process decreases with wavelength
and, according to Lord Rayleigh, it is inversely proportional to λ4. The expression
for the attenuation αR in a single component glass due to Rayleigh scattering is
approximately given by

where λ is the free-space wavelength, n is the refractive index at the wavelength of
interest, βT is the isothermal compressibility (at Tf) of the glass, k is the Boltzmann
constant, and Tf is a quantity called the fictive temperature (roughly the softening
temperature of glass) where the liquid structure during the cooling of the fiber is
frozen to become the glass structure. Fiber is drawn at high temperatures, and as the
fiber cools eventually the temperature drops sufficiently for the atomic motions to
be so sluggish that the structure becomes essentially “frozen-in” and remains like
this even at room temperature. Thus Tf marks the temperature below which the liquid structure is frozen, and hence the density fluctuations are also frozen into the
glass structure. It is apparent that Rayleigh scattering represents the lowest attenuation one can achieve using a glass structure. By proper design, the attenuation window at 1.5 μm may be lowered to approach the Rayleigh scattering limit.

This represents the lowest possible attenuation for a silica glass fiber at 1.55 μm.

OPTICAL FIBER ATTENUATION As light travels along an optical fiber, it becomes attenuated essentially following the optical fiber attenuation shown in Figure 9.26. Consider an
optical fiber link as in Figure 9.10 in which optical pulses are sent along the fiber to a destination. Suppose that the input optical power into a fiber of length L is Pin and the output
optical power at the end is Pout and intensity anywhere in the fiber at a distance z from the
input is P. The optical power attenuation coefficient α is defined as the fractional decrease
in the optical power per unit distance, i.e.,
α=−

The units for the attenuation coefficient α in exponential decays is usually Nepers per

of decibels per unit length of fiber, typically as dB km−1. The attenuation of the signal in

Suppose that we launch 1 mW of optical power into an optical fiber operating at 1550 nm
from a laser diode. Suppose that the photodetector at the output in Figure 9.10 requires a
minimum power of 100 nW to provide a clear signal (above noise). From Figure 9.26, the
attenuation αdB is roughly 0.2 dB km−1. Thus, the maximum length of fiber L allowed is

LUMINESCENCE, PHOSPHORS, AND WHITE LEDS

We know from our general experience that certain substances, known as phosphors,
can absorb light and then reemit light even after the excitation light source has been
turned off; this is an example of luminescence. In general, luminescence is the
emission of light by a material, called a phosphor, due to the absorption and conversion of energy into electromagnetic radiation as illustrated in Figure 9.27a and b.

Figure 9.27 Photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence, and a typical phosphor.

The luminescent radiation emitted by the phosphor material is considered to be quite
separate from the thermal radiation emitted by virtue of its temperature. Luminescence is light emitted by a nonthermal source when it is excited, in contrast to the
emission of radiation from a heated object such as the tungsten filament of a light
bulb; the latter is called incandescence. Typically the emission of light occurs from
certain dopants, impurities, or even defects, called luminescent or luminescence
centers, purposefully introduced into a host matrix, which may be a crystal or glass
as shown in Figure 9.27c. The luminescent center is also called an activator. There
are many examples of phosphors. For example, in ruby, the Cr3+ ions are the luminescent centers in the sapphire (Al2O3) crystal host. Cr3+ ions can absorb UV or
violet light and then emit red light. This phosphor system is written as Al2O3:Cr3+.
The excitation and emission involves only the Cr3+ ion. In other cases, the activator
excitation may also involve the host as discussed later.
Luminescence is normally categorized according to the source of excitation
energy. Photoluminescence involves excitation by photons (light) as in Figure 9.27a.
X-ray luminescence involves incident X-rays exciting a phosphor to emit light.
Cathodoluminescence, as shown in Figure 9.27b, is light emission when the excitation is the bombardment of the phosphor with energetic electrons as in TV cathode
ray tubes. Electroluminescence is light emission due to the passage of an electric
current. Electroluminescence in semiconductive materials appears as a result of an
excited electron transiting down to the ground energy level, which would correspond
to the recombination of an electron and a hole; the excited electron is the conduction
band (CB), and its ground state corresponds to a hole in the valence band (VB). The
direct electron–hole recombination mechanism generally occurs very quickly. For
example, typical minority carrier lifetimes are in the range of nanoseconds, so light
emission from a semiconductor stops within nanoseconds after the removal of the
excitation. Such quick luminescence processes occurring over a nanosecond time
scale or shorter are normally identified as fluorescence. The emission of light from
a fluorescent tube is actually a fluorescence process. The tube contains a gas mixture
of argon and mercury. The Ar and Hg gas atoms become excited by the electrical
discharge process and emit light mainly in the ultraviolet region. This UV light is
absorbed by the fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube. The excited activators
in the phosphor coating then emit radiation in the visible region. A number of phosphors are used to obtain “white” light from the tube.

The energy levels have been displaced horizontally
for clarity.

There are also phosphors from which light emission may continue for milliseconds to hours after the cessation of excitation. These slow luminescence processes
are normally referred to as phosphorescence (also known as afterglow).
Many phosphors are based on activators doped into a host matrix; for example,
Eu3+ (europium ion) in a Y2O3 (yttrium oxide) matrix is a widely used modern
phosphor. When excited by UV radiation, it provides an efficient luminescence emission in the red (around 613 nm). It is used as the red-emitting phosphor in color TV
tubes and in modern tricolor fluorescent lamps. In very general terms, we can represent the energy of an activator in a host matrix by the highly simplified energy
diagram in Figure 9.28. The ground state of the activator is E1. Upon excitation by
an incident radiation of suitable energy hfex the activator becomes excited to E2.
From this energy level, it decays, or relaxes, down relatively quickly (on a time scale
of the order of picoseconds) to an energy level E′2 by emitting phonons or lattice
vibrations. This type of decay is called radiationless or nonradiative decay. From
E′2, the activator decays down to E′1 by emitting a photon (spontaneous emission),
which is the emitted luminescent radiation. The emitted photon energy is hfem, which
is less than the excitation photon energy hfex. The return from E′1 to the ground state
E1 involves phonon emissions. Further, for some activators, E′1 is either very close
to E1, or it is E1. The energy levels such as E2, E′2, E′1, etc., are not well-defined
single levels but involve finely spaced multilevels. The higher levels may form multilevel narrow energy “bands.” In this example, the activator absorbed the incident
radiation and was directly excited, which is known as activator excitation. The Cr3+
ions in Al2O3:Cr3+ can be excited directly by blue light and would then emit in the
red. There are many phosphors in which the excitation involves the host. In host
excitation, the host matrix absorbs the incident radiation and transfers the energy to
the activator, which then becomes excited to E2 in Figure 9.28, and so on. In X-ray
phosphors, for example, the X-rays are absorbed by the host, which subsequently
transfers the energy to the activators. It is apparent from Figure 9.28 that the emitted
radiation (hfem) has a longer wavelength than the exciting radiation (hfex), that is,
hfem < hfex. The downshift in the light frequency from absorbed to emitted radiation

910

is called the Stoke’s shift. It should be emphasized that the energy levels of the activator (as shown in Figure 9.28) also depend on the host, because the internal electric
fields within the host crystal act on the activator and shift these levels up and down.
The emission characteristics depend firstly on the activator, and secondly on the host.
There are a number of host excitation mechanisms. In one possible process,
which involves a semiconductor host, as depicted in Figure 9.29, an incident photon
initially excites a valence band (VB) electron to the conduction band (CB). The
electron then thermalizes, i.e., loses the excess energy as it collides with lattice
vibrations, and falls close to Ec, and wanders around in the crystal. In one process,
a in Figure 9.29, the electron can be captured into an excited state D of a luminescent center or an activator. The electron then falls down in energy to the ground
state A of the activator releasing a photon, which is the luminescent emission. The
electron at the ground state then recombines with a hole in the VB. Thus the activator acts as a radiative recombination center. In some cases D and A may be
separate centers representing donor and acceptor-like centers, hence the labels
D and A. In other cases, the radiative recombination center may simply be a single
energy level in the bandgap, which is shown as R in Figure 9.29. The electron can
emit a photon as it is captured into R, shown as process b in Figure 9.29, or emit
the photon after it is captured by R, as it recombines with a hole, shown as process
c in Figure 9.29. Processes a and b occur in various ZnS-based phosphors. For
example, in ZnS:Cu+ phosphors, the activator is Cu+, which has an energy level at
A in Figure 9.29. The luminescent emission is enhanced by using a coactivator,
such as Al in ZnS:Cu+. Al acts as a shallow donor D, and the luminescence is due
to process a in Figure 9.29.
There may also be traps in the semiconductor because of various crystal
defects, or there may be added impurities. The electron can become captured by

a trap at a localized energy level Et in the bandgap, but close to Ec. These electron
traps temporarily capture an electron from the conduction band and thereby immobilize it. The time the electron spends trapped at Et depends on the energy depth
of the trap from the conduction band, Ec − Et. After a while a strong lattice
vibration returns the electron back into the conduction band (by thermal excitation). The time interval between photogeneration and recombination can be relatively long if the electron remains captured at Et for a considerable length of time.
In fact, the electron may become trapped and detrapped many times before it
finally recombines, so the emission of light can persist for a relatively long time
after the cessation of excitation (e.g., milliseconds or longer) as indicated by
process d in Figure 9.29.
It is also possible to excite electrons into the CB by bombarding the material
with a high-energy electron beam, which leads to cathodoluminescence. Color
CRT displays are typically coated uniformly with three sets of phosphor dots
which exhibit cathodoluminescence in the blue, red, and green wavelengths. In
electroluminescence, an electric current, either ac or dc, is used to inject electrons into the CB which then recombine with holes and emit light. For example,
passing a current through certain semiconducting phosphors such as ZnS doped
with Mn causes light emission by electroluminescence. The emission of light
from a light emitting diode (LED) is an example of injection electroluminescence in which the applied voltage causes charge carrier injection and recombination in a device (diode) that has a junction between a p-type and an n-type
semiconductor.
Zinc sulfide with various activators has been one of the traditional phosphors.
The ZnS:Ag+ in which Ag+ is the activator, is still used as a blue emitting phosphor,
though in some cases Cd is substituted for some of the Zn. ZnS:Cu+ emits in the
green, which is also a useful phosphor. Most modern phosphors, on the other hand,
have been based on using rare earth activators in various hosts. For example,
Y2O3:Eu3+ absorbs UV radiation and emits in the red. Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ absorbs blue
light and emits yellow light. Some of the most popular activators are Eu3+ for red,
Eu2+ for blue, and Tb3+ for green. Table 9.4 summarizes a number of phosphors
commonly used in various applications.

Blue luminescence is emitted by the GainN chip and “yellow” phosphorescence or luminescence is produced
by a phosphor. The combined spectrum looks “white.”

Recent inexpensive white LEDs that have appeared on the market seem to emit
white light by emitting a mixture of blue and yellow light which are registered visually by the eye as appearing white. (Yellow consists of red and green mixed together,
so mixing blue and yellow generates “white.”) The production of white LEDs became
possible due to development of bright blue-emitting LEDs based on gallium-indiumnitride (GaInN). The white LED uses a semiconductor chip emitting at a short wavelength (blue, violet, or ultraviolet) and a phosphor to convert some of the blue light
to yellow light as depicted in Figure 9.30a. The phosphor absorbs light from the
diode and undergoes luminescent emission at a longer wavelength. Obviously, the
quality and spectral characteristics of the combined emission vary with different
designs; Figure 9.30b shows example spectra involved in the blue and yellow emissions and the overall “white” emission from a white LED. Typical phosphors have
been based on yttrium aluminum garnets (Y3Al5O12, YAG) as the host material. This
host is doped with one of the rare earth elements for the activator. Cerium is a common dopant element in YAG phosphors; that is, the phosphor is Y3Al5O12:Ce3+,
which is able to efficiently absorb the blue and emit the yellow. White LEDs are
now replacing most incandescent sources for general lighting.

POLARIZATION

A propagating EM wave has its electric and magnetic fields at right angles to the
direction of propagation. If we place a z axis along the direction of propagation, then
the electric field can be in any direction in the plane perpendicular to the z axis. The
term polarization of an EM wave describes the behavior of the electric field vector
in the EM wave as it propagates through a medium. If the oscillations of the electric
field at all times are contained within a well-defined line, then the EM wave is said

to be linearly polarized as shown in Figure 9.31a. The field vibrations and the direction of propagation (z) define a plane of polarization (plane of vibration), so linear
polarization implies a wave that is plane-polarized. By contrast, if a beam of light
has waves with the E field in each in a random direction but perpendicular to z, then
this light beam is unpolarized. A light beam can be linearly polarized by passing the
beam through a polarizer, such as a polaroid sheet, a device that only passes electric
field oscillations lying on a well-defined plane parallel to its transmission axis.
Suppose that we arbitrarily place the x and y axes and describe the electric field
in terms of its components Ex and Ey along x and y (we are justified to do this because
Ex and Ey are perpendicular to z). To find the electric field in the wave at any space
and time location, we add Ex and Ey vectorially. Both Ex and Ey can individually be
described by a wave equation which must have the same angular frequency ω and
wavenumber k. However, we must include a phase difference ϕ between the two:
and

Ex = Exo cos(ωt − kz)

[9.73]

Ey = Eyo cos(ωt − kz + ϕ)

[9.74]

where ϕ is the phase difference between Ey and Ex; ϕ can arise if one of the components is delayed (retarded).
The linearly polarized wave in Figure 9.31a has the E oscillations at −45° to
the x axis as shown in Figure 9.31b. We can generate this field by choosing Exo = Eyo
and ϕ = ±180°(±π) in Equations 9.73 and 9.74. Put differently, Ex and Ey have the
same magnitude, but they are out of phase by 180°. If ux and uy are the unit vectors
along x and y, using ϕ = π in Equation 9.74, the field in the wave is
E = ux Ex + uy Ey = ux Exo cos(ωt − kz) − uy Eyo cos(ωt − kz)

or

E = Eo cos(ωt − kz)

Equations 9.75 and 9.76 state that the vector Eo is at −45° to the x axis and propagates
along the z direction.
There are many choices for the behavior of the electric field besides the simple
linear polarization in Figure 9.31. For example, if the magnitude of the field vector
E remains constant but its tip at a given location on z traces out a circle by rotating
in a clockwise sense with time, as observed by the receiver of the wave, then the
wave is said to be right circularly polarized17 as in Figure 9.32. If the rotation of
the tip of E is counterclockwise, the wave is said to be left circularly polarized.
From Equations 9.73 and 9.74, it should be apparent that a right circularly polarized
wave has Exo = Eyo = A (an amplitude) and ϕ = π∕2. This means that,
and

Ex = A cos(ωt − kz)

Ey = −A sin(ωt − kz)

It is relatively straightforward to show that Equations 9.77 and 9.78 represent a
circle that is
E2x + E2y = A2
[9.79]
as shown in Figure 9.32.
When the phase difference ϕ is other than 0, ±π, or ±π∕2, the resultant wave
is elliptically polarized and the tip of the vector in Figure 9.32 traces out an ellipse.

OPTICAL ANISOTROPY

An important characteristic of crystals is that many of their properties depend on the
crystal direction; that is, crystals are generally anisotropic. The dielectric constant εr
depends on electronic polarization which involves the displacement of electrons with
respect to positive atomic nuclei. Electronic polarization depends on the crystal direction inasmuch as it is easier to displace electrons along certain crystal directions. This
means that the refractive index n of a crystal depends on the direction of the electric
17

There is a difference in this definition in optics and engineering. The definition here follows that in optics
which is more prevalent in optoelectronics.

field in the propagating light beam. Consequently, the velocity of light in a crystal
depends on the direction of propagation and on the state of its polarization, i.e., the
direction of the electric field. Most noncrystalline materials, such as glasses and liquids, and all cubic crystals are optically isotropic, that is, the refractive index is the
same in all directions. For all classes of crystals excluding cubic structures, the refractive index depends on the propagation direction and the state of polarization. The result
of optical anisotropy is that, except along certain special directions, any unpolarized
light ray entering such a crystal breaks into two different rays with different polarizations and phase velocities. When we view an image through a calcite crystal, an optically anisotropic crystal, we see two images, each constituted by light of different
polarization passing through the crystal, whereas there is only one image through an
optically isotropic crystal as depicted in Figure 9.33. Optically anisotropic crystals are
called birefringent because an incident light beam may be doubly refracted.
Experiments and theories on “most anisotropic crystals,” i.e., those with the
highest degree of anisotropy, show that we can describe light propagation in terms
of three refractive indices, called principal refractive indices n1, n2, and n3, along
three mutually orthogonal directions in the crystal, say x, y, and z, called principal
axes. These indices correspond to the polarization state of the EM wave along these
axes. In addition, anisotropic crystals may possess one or two optic axes. An optic
axis is a special direction in the crystal along which the velocity of propagation does
not depend on the state of polarization. The propagation velocity along the optic axis
is the same whatever the polarization of the EM wave.
Crystals that have three distinct principal indices also have two optic axes and
are called biaxial crystals. On the other hand, uniaxial crystals have two of their
principal indices the same (n1 = n2) and have only one optic axis. Table 9.5 summarizes crystal classifications according to optical anisotropy. Uniaxial crystals, such
as quartz, that have n3 > n1, are called positive, and those such as calcite that have
n3 < n1 are called negative uniaxial crystals.

9.15.1 UNIAXIAL CRYSTALS AND FRESNEL’S OPTICAL INDICATRIX
For our discussions of optical anisotropy, we will consider uniaxial crystals such as
calcite and quartz. All experiments and theories lead to the following basic principles.18

These statements can be proved by solving Maxwell’s equations in an anisotropic medium.

Any EM wave entering an anisotropic crystal splits into two orthogonal linearly
polarized waves that travel with different phase velocities; that is, they experience
different refractive indices. These two orthogonally polarized waves in uniaxial crystals are called ordinary (o) and extraordinary (e) waves. The o-wave has the same
phase velocity in all directions and behaves like an ordinary wave in which the field
is perpendicular to the phase propagation direction. The e-wave has a phase velocity
that depends on its direction of propagation and its state of polarization, and further
the electric field in the e-wave is not necessarily perpendicular to the phase propagation direction. These two waves propagate with the same velocity only along a special direction called the optic axis. The o-wave is always perpendicularly polarized
to the optic axis and obeys the usual Snell’s law.
The two images observed through the calcite crystal in Figure 9.33 are due to
o-waves and e-waves being refracted differently, so when they emerge from the
crystal they have been separated. Each ray constitutes an image, but the field directions are orthogonal. The fact that this is so is easily demonstrated by using two
polaroid analyzers with their transmission axes at right angles as in Figure 9.34. If
we were to view an object along the optic axis of the crystal, we would not see two
images because the two rays would experience the same refractive index.
As mentioned, we can represent the optical properties of a crystal in terms of
three refractive indices along three orthogonal axes, the principal axes of the crystal,
shown as x, y, and z in Figure 9.35a. These are special axes along which the polarization vector and the electric field are parallel. (Put differently, the electric displacement19

Electric displacement D at any point is defined by D = εoE + P where E is the electric field and P is the
polarization at that point.

D and the electric field E vectors are parallel.) The refractive indices along these x,

oscillations along these directions (not to be confused with the wave propagation
direction). For example, for a wave with a polarization parallel to the x axes, the
refractive index is n1.
The refractive index associated with a particular EM wave in a crystal can
be determined by using Fresnel’s refractive index ellipsoid, called the optical
indicatrix,20 which is a refractive index surface placed in the center of the principal axes, as shown in Figure 9.35a, where the x, y, and z axis intercepts are n1,
n2, and n3. If all three indices were the same, n1 = n2 = n3 = no, we would have
a spherical surface and all electric field polarization directions would experience
the same refractive index no. Such a spherical surface would represent an optically

isotropic crystal. For positive uniaxial crystals such as quartz, n1 = n2 < n3, which
is the ellipsoid example shown in Figure 9.35a.
Suppose that we wish to find the refractive indices experienced by a wave traveling
with an arbitrary wavevector k, which represents the direction of phase propagation.
This phase propagation direction is shown as OP in Figure 9.35b and is at an angle θ
to the z axis. We place a plane perpendicular to OP and passing through the center O
of the indicatrix. This plane intersects the ellipsoid surface in a curve ABA′B′ which is
an ellipse. The major (BOB′) and minor (AOA′) axes of this ellipse determine the field
oscillation directions and the refractive indices associated with this wave. Put differently,
the original wave is now represented by two orthogonally polarized EM waves.
The line AOA′, the minor axis, corresponds to the polarization of the ordinary wave,
and its semiaxis AA′ is the refractive index no = n2 of this o-wave. The electric displacement and the electric field are in the same direction and parallel to AOA′. If we were
to change the direction of OP, we would always find the same minor axis, i.e., no is
either n1 or n2 whatever the orientation of OP (try orientating OP to be along y and
along x). This means that the o-wave always experiences the same refractive index in
all directions. (The o-wave behaves just like an ordinary wave, hence the name.)
The line BOB′ in Figure 9.35b, the major axis, corresponds to the electric displacement field (D) oscillations in the extraordinary wave, and its semiaxis OB is the refractive index ne(θ) of this e-wave. This refractive index is smaller than n3 but greater than
n2 (= no). The e-wave therefore travels more slowly than the o-wave in this particular
direction and in this crystal. If we change the direction of OP, we find that the length
of the major axis changes with the OP direction. Thus, ne(θ) depends on the wave direction θ. As apparent, ne = no when OP is along the z axis, that is, when the wave is
traveling along z as in Figure 9.36a. This direction is the optic axis, and all waves traveling along the optic axis have the same phase velocity whatever their polarization. When
the e-wave is traveling along the y axis, or along the x axis, ne(θ) = n3 = ne and the
e-wave has its slowest phase velocity as shown in Figure 9.36b. Along any OP direction
that is at an angle θ to the optic axis, the e-wave has a refractive index ne(θ) given by

Clearly, for θ = 0°, ne(0°) = no and for θ = 90°, ne(90°) = ne.
The major axis BOB′ in Figure 9.35b determines the e-wave polarization by
defining the direction of the displacement vector D and not E. Although D is perpendicular to k, this is not true for E. The electric field Ee-wave of the e-wave is
orthogonal to that of the o-wave, and it is in the plane determined by k and the optic
axis. Ee-wave is orthogonal to k only when the e-wave propagates along one of the
principal axes. In birefringent crystals it is usual to take the ray direction as the
direction of energy flow, that is the direction of the Poynting vector (S). The Ee-wave
is then orthogonal to the ray direction. For the o-wave, the wavefront propagation
direction k is the same as the energy flow direction S. For the e-wave, however, the
wavefront propagation direction k is not the same as the energy flow direction S.

9.15.2 BIREFRINGENCE OF CALCITE
Consider a calcite crystal (CaCO3) which is a negative uniaxial crystal and also well
known for its double refraction. When the surfaces of a calcite crystal have been
cleaved, that is, cut along certain crystal planes, the crystal attains a shape that is
called a cleaved form and the crystal faces are rhombohedrons (parallelogram with
78.08° and 101.92°). A cleaved form of the crystal is called a calcite rhomb. A plane
of the calcite rhomb that contains the optical axis and is normal to a pair of opposite
crystal surfaces is called a principal section.
Consider what happens when an unpolarized or natural light enters a calcite
crystal at normal incidence and thus also normal to a principal section to this surface,
but at an angle to the optic axis as shown in Figure 9.37. The ray breaks into ordinary (o) and extraordinary (e) waves with mutually orthogonal polarizations. The waves
propagate in the plane of the principal section as this plane also contains the incident
light. The o-wave has its field oscillations perpendicular to the optic axis. It obeys
Snell’s law which means that it enters the crystal undeflected. Thus the direction of
E-field oscillations must come out of the paper so that it is normal to the optic axis

and also to the direction of propagation. The field E⊥ in the o-ray is shown as dots,
oscillating into and out of the paper.
The e-wave has a polarization orthogonal to the o-wave and in the principal
section. The e-wave polarization is in the plane of the paper, indicated as E∥, in
Figure 9.37. It travels with a different velocity and diverges from the o-wave. Clearly,
the e-wave does not obey the usual Snell’s law inasmuch as the angle of refraction
is not zero. We can determine the e-ray direction by noting that the e-wave propagates sideways as in Figure 9.37b at right angles to E∥.

9.15.3 DICHROISM
In addition to the variation in the refractive index, some anisotropic crystals also exhibit
dichroism, a phenomenon in which the optical absorption in a substance depends on
the direction of propagation and the state of polarization of the light beam. A dichroic
crystal is an optically anisotropic crystal in which either the e-wave or the o-wave is
heavily attenuated (absorbed). This means that a light wave of arbitrary polarization
entering a dichroic crystal emerges with a well-defined polarization because the other
orthogonal polarization would have been attenuated. Generally dichroism depends on
the wavelength of light. For example, in a tourmaline (aluminum borosilicate) crystal,
the o-wave is much more heavily absorbed with respect to the e-wave.

9.16

BIREFRINGENT RETARDING PLATES

Consider a positive uniaxial crystal such as a quartz (ne > no) plate that has the optic
axis (taken along z) parallel to the plate faces as in Figure 9.38. Suppose that a
linearly polarized wave is normally incident on a plate face. If the field E is parallel to the optic axis (shown as E∥), then this wave will travel through the crystal as
an e-wave with a velocity c∕ne slower than the o-wave since ne > no. Thus, the optic
axis is the “slow axis” for waves polarized parallel to it. If E is at right angles to
the optic axis (shown as E⊥), then this wave will travel with a velocity c∕no, which
will be the fastest velocity in the crystal. Thus the axis perpendicular to the optic
axis (say x) will be the “fast axis” for polarization along this direction. When a light
ray enters a crystal at normal incidence to the optic axis and plate surface, then the

o- and e-waves travel along the same direction as shown in Figure 9.38. We can of
course resolve a linear polarization at an angle α to z into E⊥ and E∥. The o-wave
corresponds to the propagation of E⊥ and the e-wave to the propagation of E∥ in the
crystal. When the light comes out at the opposite face, these two components E⊥
and E∥ would have been phase shifted by ϕ. Depending on the initial angle α of E
and the length of the crystal, which determines the total phase shift ϕ through the
plate, the emerging beam can have its initial linear polarization rotated, or changed
into an elliptically or circularly polarized light as summarized in Figure 9.39.
If L is the thickness of the plate, then the o-wave experiences a phase change
given by ko-wave L through the plate where ko-wave is the wavevector of the o-wave;
ko-wave = (2π∕λ)no, where λ is the free-space wavelength. Similarly, the e-wave
experiences a phase change (2π∕λ)neL through the plate. Thus, the phase difference
ϕ between the orthogonal components E⊥ and E∥ of the emerging beam is

[9.81]

The phase difference ϕ expressed in terms of full wavelengths is called the retardation
of the plate. For example, a phase difference ϕ of 180° is a half-wavelength retardation.
The polarization of the exiting-beam depends on the crystal-type, (ne − no), and
the plate thickness L. We know that depending on the phase difference ϕ between
the orthogonal components of the field, the EM wave can be linearly, circularly, or

with this phase shift ϕ, E would be at an angle −α to the optic axis and still linearly

OPTICAL ACTIVITY AND CIRCULAR
BIREFRINGENCE

When a linearly polarized light wave is passed through a quartz crystal along its
optic axis, it is observed that the emerging wave has its E-vector (plane of polarization) rotated, which is illustrated in Figure 9.40. This rotation increases continuously with the distance traveled through the crystal (about 21.7° per mm of
quartz). The rotation of the plane of polarization by a substance is called optical
activity. In very simple intuitive terms, optical activity occurs in materials in
which the electron motions induced by the external electromagnetic field follows

OPTICAL ACTIVITY AND CIRCULAR BIREFRINGENCE

spiraling or helical paths (orbits).21 Electrons flowing in helical paths resemble
a current flowing in a coil and thus possess a magnetic moment. The optical
field in light therefore induces oscillating magnetic moments which can be either
parallel or antiparallel to the induced oscillating electric dipoles. Wavelets
emitted from these oscillating induced magnetic and electric dipoles interfere to
constitute a forward wave that has its optical field rotated either clockwise or
counterclockwise.
If θ is the angle of rotation, then θ is proportional to the distance L propagated
in the optically active medium as depicted in Figure 9.40. For an observer receiving
the wave through quartz, the rotation of the plane of polarization may be clockwise
(to the right) or counterclockwise (to the left) which are called dextrorotatory and
levorotatory forms of optical activity. The structure of quartz is such that atomic
arrangements spiral around the optic axis either in clockwise or counterclockwise
sense. Quartz thus occurs in two distinct crystalline forms, right-handed and lefthanded, which exhibit dextrorotatory and levorotatory types of optical activity,
respectively. Although we used quartz as an example, there are many substances
that are optically active, including various biological substances and even some
liquid solutions (e.g., corn syrup) that contain various organic molecules with a
rotatory power.
The specific rotatory power (θ∕L) is defined as the extent of rotation per unit
distance traveled in the optically active substance. Specific rotatory power depends
on the wavelength. For example, for quartz this is 49° per mm at 400 nm but
17° per mm at 650 nm.
Optical activity can be understood in terms of left and right circularly polarized
waves traveling at different velocities in the crystal, i.e., experiencing different refractive indices. Due to the helical twisting of the molecular or atomic arrangements in
the crystal, the velocity of a circularly polarized wave depends on whether the optical field rotates clockwise or counterclockwise. A vertically polarized light with a
field E at the input can be thought of as two right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves ER and EL that are symmetrical with respect to the y axis, i.e., at any
instant α = β, as shown in Figure 9.41. If they travel at the same velocity through
the crystal, then they remain symmetrical with respect to the vertical (α = β remains
the same) and the resultant is still a vertically polarized light. If, however, these
travel at different velocities through a medium, then at the output E′L and E′R are no
longer symmetrical with respect to the vertical, α′ ≠ β′, and their resultant is a vector
E′ at an angle θ to the y axis.
Suppose that nR and nL are the refractive indices experienced by the right- and
left-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. After traversing the crystal length
L, the phase difference between the two optical fields E′R and E′L at the output leads
to a new optical field E′ that is E rotated by θ, given by

If these travel at different velocities through a medium, then at the output they are no longer

where λ is the free-space wavelength. For a left-handed quartz crystal, and for 589 nm
light propagation along the optic axis, nR = 1.54427 and nL = 1.54420, which means
θ is about 21.4° per mm of crystal.
In a circularly birefringent medium, the right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves propagate with different velocities and experience different refractive
indices nR and nL. Since optically active materials naturally rotate the optical field,
it is not unreasonable to expect that a circularly polarized light with its optical field
rotating in the same sense as the optical activity will find it easier to travel through
the medium. Thus, an optically active medium possesses different refractive indices
for right- and left-handed circularly polarized light and exhibits circular birefringence. It should be mentioned that if the direction of the light wave is reversed in
Figure 9.40, the ray simply retraces itself and E′ becomes E.

LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS (LCDs)

Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are widely used in many flat panel televisions and
computer displays. LCDs contain liquid crystals that change the polarization of a
passing beam of light. Liquid crystals (LCs) are materials that possess rod-like
molecules as shown in 9.42a. These molecules, called mesogens, have strong
dipoles, which means that the whole LC structure can be easily polarized. What
distinguishes LCs is that they have properties that are between those of a liquid
phase and those of a crystalline solid phase; e.g., they can flow like a liquid but,
at the same time, have crystalline domains that lead to anisotropic optical properties.
A distinct characteristic of the liquid crystal state is the tendency of the mesogens

to point along a common axis called the director. This is a preferred common axis in
the liquid crystal along which the mesogens try to align themselves, which results in
an orientationally ordered state as depicted in Figure 9.42b. This behavior is very different than the way in which molecules behave in a normal liquid phase, where there
is no intrinsic order. The orientational order in the liquid crystal state lies between that
of a normal crystalline solid, i.e., fully ordered periodic structure and that of a normal
liquid, i.e., nearly fully disordered; and hence is given the name mesogenic state.
The degree of alignment of mesogens along the director, that is, the degree of
anisotropy, depends on the temperature because thermally induced random motions
of the mesogens act against dipole alignment. The degree of alignment will be a
maximum at low temperatures and decreases with increasing temperature, until at
some critical temperature the random thermal motions destroy the order. The liquid
crystals are known to have a number of phases. We will consider the nematic phase,
which is characterized by mesogens that have no positional order, but tend to point
along the same direction, i.e., along the director. The physical properties of the
nematic phase depend sensitively on the degree of alignment, and can be highly
anisotropic for well-aligned materials. A distinct advantage is that an applied field
can control the molecular orientation and hence the optical properties. The molecules
in these nematic-phase materials have rod-like shapes with lengths typically in the
20–30 nm range as depicted in Figure 9.42a.
Liquid crystal display (LCD) is a display that uses a liquid crystal medium whose
optical properties can be controlled by an applied field. The LCD behaves as a light
modulator or a light valve. The display has a thin film of liquid crystal, e.g., a few
microns in thickness, placed between two semitransparent electrically conducting electrodes to form a cell. Most LCDs are based on the twisted nematic field effect.22 In
a twisted nematic liquid crystal cell, as shown in Figure 9.43a, the two electrodes

Although a number of researchers have reported interesting observations on the optical properties of liquid
crystals, the pioneering work on the twisted nematic LCD has been attributed to Martin Schadt and Wolfgang
Helfrich (at Hoffman-LaRoche, Switzerland) in 1970–1971 and James Ferguson (USA) in 1971.

have surfaces that have been treated, i.e., have an orientational layer, to act as directors
for the molecules and the directors are at right angles to each other. Molecules next
to the surfaces are forced to align along these surface directors and hence the molecules
homogenously twist through 90° from one electrode to the other. The twisted nematic
liquid crystal has its molecules arranged in a helical structure, and is able to “twist,”
or rotate the electric field in light that passes through it. Two polarizers A and B have
been placed at the entrance and the exit ends of the cell respectively. Thus, polarized
light enters the cell and has its polarization rotated by 90° as it passes through the cell,
and arrives at the exit polarizer. Since this light has its polarization aligned with the
optical axis of the exit polarizer (B), it passes through the polarizer. Therefore, without
an applied field, the light is transmitted through the LCD, which appears bright.
Consider what happens when an electric field Ea is applied by connecting an ac
voltage (typically a few volts) to the two electrodes on the opposite the faces of the cell
as shown in Figure 9.43b. The applied field now disturbs the alignment of the molecules
in the nematic liquid crystal. The field Ea acts as an externally imposed director and
the molecules align with the field, which results in the twisted molecular arrangement

being destroyed. Stated differently, the helix structure in Figure 9.43a becomes unwound
and results in the structure shown in Figure 9.43b. The polarization of the light entering
the cell is unaffected and therefore the light cannot pass through the exit polarizer (B).
The LCD cell therefore appears dark. In fact, the light transmission can be completely
extinguished by applying a sufficiently large field. If a mirror is placed behind the
second polarizer, the display operates under reflection instead of transmission.
How can we reverse the switching behavior, that is, switch the LCD from dark
(without an applied voltage) to bright (with applied voltage)? This can be easily
achieved by using parallel polarizers, that is A and B in Figure 9.43a have the same
polarization direction. In this case, there would be no transmitted light in Figure
9.43a and transmitted light in b. By varying the applied voltage between the threshold for reorientation and the saturation field for unwinding the twisted nematic structure, we can obtain grey scale modulation. The transparent electrodes are typically
indium-tin-oxide, and can be patterned by lithographic techniques into various desirable shapes. More than 50 percent of TV screens use the LCD technology.
The electric field in Figure 9.43b has been applied by connecting an ac voltage
to the LCD electrodes. LCDs are always operated with an ac voltage; typical operating frequencies for LCDs are ∼1 kHz. The reversal of the field does not change the
principle of operation because molecules always try to align parallel to the field,
which is along either +z or −z. In both cases, the field E in the light beam is not
rotated and the light through the LCD is extinguished at the second polarizer (B).
The amount of transmission through an LCD depends on the rms value of the ac
voltage. Manufacturers typically provide the transmittance versus rms voltage characteristics of their LCDs. The rotation angle Φ of the linearly polarized light through
the liquid crystal medium depends on the rms voltage Vrms across an LCD cell, which
is shown in Figure 9.44. The normalized transmittance T′ = T(Vrms)∕Tmax is also

shown as a function of Vrms. Tmax is the maximum transmittance under bright transmission conditions so that T(Vrms)∕Tmax = 100 percent with no or very small Vrms.
It is clear from Figure 9.44 that the rms voltage Vrms must reach a certain threshold value before any effect is seen. We need to apply a certain threshold voltage to start
untwisting the alignment of the mesogens. The rms voltage V90 corresponding to 90 percent normalized transmission T′ is generally defined as the threshold voltage. The
voltage at which T′ has dropped to 10 percent defines the saturation voltage, V10. LCD
response times for turning on (alignment with the applied field) and off (alignment with
the surface directors) depend on the properties of the LC, the thickness of the cell, and
temperature. At room temperature, these turn on and off times are typically in the millisecond time range with the turn off time usually being longer than the on time. It is
faster to align the molecules with the applied field, than the time it takes for them to
naturally align with the surface directors when the applied field is turned off.
The whole LCD operation is based on three important effects. First is the optical
activity exhibited by the twisted nematic LC structure in which the twisted mesogens
rotate the electric field. The second is the ability to rotate or align the mesogens in the
LC by a sufficiently large applied field imposed by an external voltage source connected
to the LCD cell. The third is the use of two polarizers (A and B in Figure 9.43a) in
converting the rotation of the electric field of the light beam within the medium to an
intensity variation that appears after the second polarizer (B).

ELECTRO-OPTIC EFFECTS

Electro-optic effects refer to changes in the refractive index of a material induced by
the application of an external electric field, which therefore “modulates” the optical
properties. We can apply such an external field by placing electrodes on opposite
faces of a crystal and connecting these electrodes to a battery. The presence of such
a field distorts the electron motions in the atoms or molecules of the substance or
distorts the crystal structure resulting in changes in the optical properties. For example, an applied external field can cause an optically isotropic crystal such as GaAs
to become birefringent. In this case, the field induces principal axes and an optic
axis. Typically changes in the refractive index are small. The frequency of the applied
field has to be such that the field appears static over the time scale it takes for the medium
to change its properties, that is, respond, as well as for any light to cross the substance.
The electro-optic effects are classified according to first- and second-order effects.
If we were to take the refractive index n to be a function of the applied electric
field E, that is, n = n(E), we can of course expand this as a Taylor series in E. The
new refractive index n′ is
n′ = n + a1E + a2E2 + ⋯

[9.83]

where the coefficients a1 and a2 are called the linear electro-optic effect and secondorder electro-optic effect coefficients. Although we would expect even higher terms
in the expansion in Equation 9.83, these are generally very small and their effects
negligible within the highest practical fields. The change in n due to the first E term

9 .1 9

ELECTRO-OPTIC EFFECTS

929

is called the Pockels effect. The change in n due to the second E2 term is called the
Kerr effect,23 and the coefficient a2 is generally written as λK where K is called the
Kerr coefficient. Thus, the two effects are
Δn = a1E

[9.84]

Pockels effect

Δn = a2E2 = (λK)E2

[9.85]

Kerr effect

and
All materials exhibit the Kerr effect. It may be thought that we will always find
some (nonzero) value for a1 for all materials, but this is not true and only certain
crystalline materials exhibit the Pockels effect. If we apply a field E in one direction
and then reverse the field and apply −E, then according to Equation 9.84, Δn should
change sign. If the refractive index increases for E, it must decrease for −E. Reversing the field should not lead to an identical effect (the same Δn). The structure has
to respond differently to E and −E. There must therefore be some asymmetry in the
structure to distinguish between E and −E. In a noncrystalline material, Δn for E
would be the same as Δn for −E as all directions are equivalent in terms of dielectric properties. Thus a1 = 0 for all noncrystalline materials (such as glasses and
liquids). Similarly, if the crystal structure has a center of symmetry, then reversing
the field direction has an identical effect and a1 is again zero. Only crystals that are
noncentrosymmetric24 exhibit the Pockels effect. For example, a NaCl crystal
(centrosymmetric) exhibits no Pockels effect, but a GaAs crystal (noncentrosymmetric) does.
The Pockels effect expressed in Equation 9.84 is an oversimplification because
in reality we have to consider the effect of an applied field along a particular crystal direction on the refractive index for light with a given propagation direction and
polarization. For example, suppose that x, y, and z are the principal axes of a crystal
with refractive indices n1, n2, and n3 along these directions. For an optically isotropic
crystal, these would be the same whereas for a uniaxial crystal such as LiNbO3
n1 = n2 ≠ n3 as depicted in the xy cross section in Figure 9.45a. Suppose that we
suitably apply a voltage across a crystal and thereby apply an external dc field Ea.
In the Pockels effect, the field will modify the optical indicatrix. The exact effect
depends on the crystal structure. For example, a crystal like GaAs, optically isotropic with a spherical indicatrix, becomes birefringent with two different refractive
indices. In the case of LiNbO3 (lithium niobate), which is an optoelectronically
important uniaxial crystal, a field Ea along the y direction changes the principal
refractive indices n1 and n2 (both equal to no) to n′1 and n′2 as illustrated in Figure 9.45b.
Moreover, in some crystals such as KDP (KH 2PO 4, potassium dihydrogen
phosphate), the field Ea along z rotates the principal axes by 45° about z and changes
the principal indices. Rotation of principal axes in LiNbO3 is small and can be
neglected.
23

John Kerr (1824–1907) was a Scottish physicist who was a faculty member at Free Church Training College for
Teachers, Glasgow (1857–1901) where he set up an optics laboratory and demonstrated the Kerr effect (1875).
A crystal is a center of symmetry about a point O, if any atom (or point) with a position vector r from O also
appears when we invert r, that is, take −r.

field Ea parallel to the principal y axis as in Figure 9.45b, the light propagates as
two orthogonally polarized waves (parallel to x and y) experiencing different refractive indices n′1 and n′2. The applied field thus induces a birefringence for light traveling along the z axis. Before the field Ea is applied, the refractive indices n1 and n2
are both equal to no. The Pockels effect then gives the new refractive indices n′1 and
n′2 in the presence of Ea as

where r22 is a constant, called a Pockels coefficient, that depends on the crystal
structure and the material. The reason for the seemingly unusual subscript notation
is that there are more than one constant and these are elements of a tensor that
represents the optical response of the crystal to an applied field along a particular
direction with respect to the principal axes (the exact theory is more mathematical
than intuitive). We therefore have to use the correct Pockels coefficients for the
refractive index changes for a given crystal and a given field direction.25 If the field
were along z, the Pockels coefficient in Equation 9.86 would be r13. Table 9.6 shows
some typical values for Pockels coefficients of various crystals.
It is clear that the control of the refractive index by an external applied field
(and hence a voltage) is a distinct advantage that enables the phase change through
a Pockels crystal to be controlled or modulated; such a phase modulator is called
a Pockels cell. In the longitudinal Pockels cell phase modulator the applied field is
in the direction of light propagation, whereas in the transverse phase modulator the
applied field is transverse to the direction of light propagation.
Consider the transverse phase modulator in Figure 9.46. In this example, the
applied electric field Ea = V∕d is applied parallel to the y direction, normal to the

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

DEFINING TERMS
Absorption is the loss in the power of electromagnetic radiation that is traveling in a medium. The loss is
due to the conversion of light energy to other forms of
energy, such as lattice vibrations (heat) during the polarization of the molecules of the medium, local vibrations of impurity ions, excitation of electrons from the
valence band to the conduction band, and so on.
Activator is a luminescent center in a host crystal or
glass in which it is excited, by some external excitation
such as UV light; following excitation, the activator
emits radiation to return to its ground state, or become
de-excited.
Anisotropy (optical) refers to the fact that the refractive index n of a crystal depends on the direction of
propagation of light and on the state of its polarization,
that is, the direction of the electric field.
Antireflection coating is a thin dielectric layer coated
on an optical device or component to reduce the reflection of light and increase the transmitted light intensity.
Attenuation is the decrease in the optical power (or
irradiance) of a traveling wave in the direction of propagation due to absorption and scattering.
Attenuation coefficient α represents the spatial rate
of attenuation of an EM wave along the direction of
propagation. If Po is the optical power at some location
O, and if it is P at a distance L from O along the direction
of propagation, then P = Po exp(−αL).
Birefringent crystals such as calcite are optically
anisotropic which leads to an incident light beam becoming separated into ordinary and extraordinary waves
with orthogonal polarizations; incident light becomes
doubly refracted because these two waves experience
different refractive indices no and ne.
Brewster’s angle or polarization angle (θp) is the angle of incidence that results in the reflected wave having
no electric field in the plane of incidence (plane defined by the incident ray and the normal to the surface).
The electric field oscillations in the reflected wave are
in the plane perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
Circularly birefringent medium is a medium in which
right and left circularly polarized waves propagate with

different velocities and experience different refractive
indices nR and nL.
Circularly polarized light is light where the magnitude of the field vector E remains constant but its tip at
a given location on the direction of propagation traces
out a circle by rotating either in a clockwise sense,
right circularly polarized, with time, as observed by
the receiver of the wave, or in a counterclockwise
sense, left circularly polarized.
Complex propagation constant (k′ − jk″) describes
the propagation characteristics of an electromagnetic
wave that is experiencing attenuation as it travels in a
lossy medium. If k = k′ − jk″ is the complex propagation
constant, then the electric field component of a plane
wave traveling in a lossy medium can be described by
E = Εo exp(−k″z) exp j(ωt − k′z)
The amplitude decays exponentially while the wave
propagates along z. The real k′ part of the complex propagation constant (wavevector) describes the propagation
characteristics, that is, the phase velocity v = ω∕k′. The
imaginary k″ part describes the rate of attenuation
along z.
Complex refractive index N with real part n and
imaginary part K is defined as the ratio of the complex
propagation constant k in a medium to propagation

The real part n is simply called the refractive index,
and K is called the extinction coefficient.
Critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence that results in a refracted wave at 90° when the incident wave
is traveling in a medium of lower refractive index and
is incident at a boundary with a material with a higher
refractive index.
Dielectric mirror is made from alternating high and
low refractive index quarter-wave-thick multilayers
such that constructive interference of partially reflected
waves gives rise to a high degree of wavelength-selective
reflectance.

DEFINING TERMS
Dispersion relation is a relationship between the refractive index n and the wavelength λ of the EM wave,
n = n(λ); the wavelength usually refers to the freespace wavelength. The relationship between the angular frequency ω and the propagation constant k, the
ω–k curve, is also called the dispersion relation.

if the power meter can respond more quickly than the
oscillations of the electric field, and since this is in the
optical frequencies range, all practical measurements
invariably yield the average irradiance.

Dispersive medium has a refractive index n that depends on the wavelength; that is, n is not a constant.

Kerr effect is a second-order effect in which the
change in the refractive index n depends on the square
of the electric field, that is, Δn = a2E2, where a2 is a
material dependent constant.

Electro-optic effects refer to changes in the refractive
index of a material induced by the application of an
external electric field, which therefore “modulates” the
optical properties; the applied field is not the electric
field of any light wave, but a separate external field.

Kramers–Kronig relations relate the real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity. If we know the
complete frequency dependence of the real part ε′r(ω),
using the Kramer–Kronig relation, we can find the frequency dependence of the imaginary part εr″(ω).

Extinction coefficient is the imaginary part of the
complex refractive index N.

Luminescence is the emission of light by a material,
called a phosphor, due to the absorption and conversion
of energy into electromagnetic radiation. Typically the
emission of light occurs from certain dopant impurities
or even defects, called luminescent or luminescence
centers or activators purposefully introduced into a
host matrix, which may be a crystal or glass, which can
accept the activators. Photoluminescence involves excitation by photons (light). Cathodoluminescence is
light emission when the excitation is the bombardment
of the phosphor with energetic electrons as in TV cathode ray tubes. Electroluminescence is light emission
due to the passage of an electric current as in the LED.

Fluorescence is luminescence that occurs over very
short time scales, usually less than 10−8 seconds (or
10 ns). In fluorescence, the onset and decay of luminescent emission, due to the onset and cessation of excitation of the phosphor, is very short, appearing to be
almost instantaneous.
Fresnel’s equations describe the amplitude and phase
relationships between the incident, reflected, and
transmitted waves at a dielectric–dielectric interface in
terms of the refractive indices of the two media and the
angle of incidence.
Group index (Ng) represents the factor by which the
group velocity of a group of waves in a dielectric medium is reduced with respect to propagation in free
space, Ng = c∕vg where vg is the group velocity.
Group velocity (vg) is the velocity at which energy, or
information, is transported by a group of waves; vg is
determined by dω∕dk whereas phase velocity is determined by ω∕k.

Optic axis is an axis in the crystal structure along
which there is no double refraction for light propagation
along this axis.
Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarization of plane polarized light by a substance such as
quartz.

Instantaneous irradiance is the instantaneous flow
of energy per unit time per unit area and is given by the
instantaneous value of the Poynting vector S.

Optical indicatrix (Fresnel’s ellipsoid) is a refractive
index surface placed in the center of the principal axes
x, y, and z of a crystal; the axis intercepts are n1, n2, and
n3. We can represent the optical properties of a crystal
in terms of three refractive indices along three orthogonal axes, the principal axes of the crystal, x, y, and z.

Irradiance (average) is the average flow of energy
per unit time per unit area where averaging is typically
carried out by the light detector (over many oscillation
periods). Average irradiance can also be defined mathematically by the average value of the Poynting vector
S. The instantaneous irradiance can only be measured

Phase of a traveling wave is the quantity (kx − ωt)
which determines the amplitude of the wave at position
x and at time t given the propagation constant k(= 2π∕λ)
and angular frequency ω. In three dimensions it is the
quantity (k · r − ωt) where k is the wavevector and r is
the position vector.

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

Phase velocity is the rate at which a given phase on a
traveling wave advances. It represents the velocity of a
given phase rather than the velocity at which information is carried by the wave. Two consecutive peaks of a
wave are separated by a wavelength λ, and it takes a time
period 1∕f for one peak to reach the next (or the time
separation of two consecutive peaks at one location);
then the phase velocity is defined as v = λf.
Phosphor is a substance made of an activator and a
host matrix (crystal or glass) that exhibits luminescence
upon suitable excitation.
Phosphorescence is a slow luminescence process in
which luminescent emission occurs well after the cessation of excitation, even after minutes or hours.
Pockels effect is a linear change in the refractive index n of a crystal due to an application of an external
electric field E, other than the field of the light wave,
that is, Δn = a1E, where a1 is a constant that depends
on the crystal structure.
Polarization of an EM wave describes the behavior of
the electric field vector in the EM wave as it propagates
through a medium. If the oscillations of the electric
field at all times are contained within a well-defined
line, then the EM wave is said to be linearly polarized.
The field vibrations and the direction of propagation,
e.g., z direction, define a plane of polarization (plane
of vibration), so linear polarization implies a wave that
is plane-polarized.
Poynting vector (S) represents the energy flow per
unit time per unit area in a direction determined by
E × B (direction of propagation), S = v 2εoεr E × B.
Its magnitude, power flow per unit area, is called the
irradiance.
Principal axes of the crystal, normally labeled, x, y,
and z, are special axes along which the polarization
vector and the electric field are parallel. Put differently,
the electric displacement D and the electric field E vectors are parallel. The refractive indices along these x, y,
and z axes are the principal indices n1, n2, and n3, respectively, for electric field oscillations along these
directions (not to be confused with the wave propagation
direction).
Reflectance is the fraction of power in the reflected
electromagnetic wave with respect to the incident power.

Reflection coefficient is the ratio of the amplitude of
the reflected EM wave to that of the incident wave. It
can be positive, negative, or a complex number which
then represents a phase change.
Refraction is a change in the direction of a wave when
it enters a medium with a different refractive index. A
wave that is incident at a boundary between two media
with different refractive indices experiences refraction
and changes direction in passing from one to the other
medium.
Refractive index n of an optical medium is the ratio
of the velocity of light in a vacuum to its velocity in the
medium n = c∕v.
Retarding plates are optical devices that change the
state of polarization of an incident light beam. For example, when a linearly polarized light enters a quarterwave plate, it emerges from the device either as
circularly or elliptically polarized light, depending on
the angle of the incident electric field with respect to
the optic axis of the retarder plate.
Scattering is a process by which the energy from a
propagating EM wave is redirected as secondary EM
waves in various directions away from the original direction of propagation. There are a number of scattering
processes. In Rayleigh scattering, fluctuations in the
refractive index, inhomogeneities, etc., lead to the scattering of light that decreases with the wavelength as λ4.
Snell’s law is a law that relates the angles of incidence
and refraction when an EM wave traveling in one medium becomes refracted as it enters an adjacent medium. If light is traveling in a medium with index n1 is
incident on a medium of index n2, and if the angles of
incidence and refraction (transmission) are θi and θt,
then according to Snell’s law,
sin θi n2
=
sin θt n1
Specific rotatory power is defined as the amount of
rotation of the optical field in a linearly polarized
light per unit distance traveled in the optically active
substance.
Stoke’s shift in luminescence is the shift down in the
frequency of the emitted radiation with respect to that
of the exciting radiation.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS

935

Total internal reflection (TIR) is the total reflection
of a wave traveling in a medium when it is incident at a
boundary with another medium of lower refractive index. The angle of incidence must be greater than the
critical angle θc which depends on the refractive indices sin θc > n2∕n1.

Wavefront is a surface where all the points have the
same phase. A wavefront on a plane wave is an infinite
plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Transmission coefficient is the ratio of the amplitude
of the transmitted wave to that of the incident wave
when the incident wave traveling in a medium meets a
boundary with a different medium (different refractive
index).

Wavepacket is a group of waves with slightly different frequencies traveling together and forming a
“group.” This wavepacket travels with a group velocity
vg that depends on the slope of ω versus k characteristics of the wavepacket, i.e., vg = dω∕dk.

Transmittance is the fraction of transmitted intensity
when a wave traveling in a medium is incident at a
boundary with a different medium (different refractive
index).

Wavenumber or propagation constant is defined as
2π∕λ where λ is the wavelength. It is the phase shift in
the wave over a distance of unit length.

Wavevector is a vector denoted as k that describes the
direction of propagation of a wave and has the magnitude of the wavenumber, k = 2π∕λ.

A
Bragg’s Diffraction Law
and X-ray Diffraction
Bragg’s Diffraction Condition
X-rays are electromagnetic (EM) waves with wavelengths typically in the range from 0.01 nm
to a few nanometers. This wavelength region is comparable with typical interplanar spacings
in crystals. When an X-ray beam impinges on a crystal, the waves in the beam interact with
the planes of atoms in the crystal and, as a result, the waves become scattered and the X-ray
beam becomes diffracted. An analogy with radio waves may help. Radio waves with wavelengths in the range 1–10 m (short waves and VHF waves) easily interact with objects of
comparable size. It is well known that these radio waves become scattered by objects of
comparable size such as trees, houses, and buildings. However, long-wave radio waves with
wavelengths in kilometers do not become scattered by these objects because the object sizes
now are much smaller than the wavelength.
When X-rays strike a crystal, the EM waves penetrate the crystal structure. Each plane
of atoms in the crystal reflects a portion of the waves. The reflected waves from different
planes then interfere with each other and give rise to a diffracted beam, which is at a welldefined angle 2θ to the incident beam as depicted in Figure A.1. Some of the incident beam
goes through the crystal undiffracted and some of the beam becomes diffracted. Further, the
diffracted rays exist only in certain directions. These diffraction directions correspond to
well-defined diffraction angles 2θ, as defined in Figure A.1. The diffraction angle 2θ, the
wavelength of the X-rays λ, and the interplanar separation d of the diffraction planes within
the crystal are related through the Bragg diffraction condition, that is,

Consider X-rays penetrating a crystal structure and becoming reflected by a given set of
atomic planes as shown in Figure A.2. We can consider an X-ray beam to be many parallel
waves that are in phase. These waves penetrate the crystal structure and become reflected at
successive atomic planes. The interplanar separation of these planes is d. Waves reflected
from adjacent atomic planes interfere constructively to constitute a diffracted beam only when
the path difference between the rays is an integer multiple of the wavelength—a requirement
of constructive interference. This will only be the case for certain directions of reflection.
For simplicity, we will consider two waves A and B in an X-ray beam being reflected from
two consecutive atomic planes in the crystal. The angle between the X-rays and the atomic
planes is θ as defined in Figure A.2. Initially, the waves A and B are in phase. Wave A is
reflected from the first plane, whereas wave B is reflected from the second plane. When wave
A is reflected at O, wave B is at P. Wave B becomes reflected from O′ on the second plane
and then moves along reflected B′. Wave B has to travel a further distance, PO′Q, equivalent
to 2d sin θ before reaching wave A. The path difference between the two reflected waves A′
and B′ is PO′Q or 2d sin θ. For constructive interference, this must be nλ where n is an
integer. Otherwise, the reflected waves will interfere destructively and cancel each other out.
Thus, the condition for the existence of a diffracted beam is that the path difference between
A′ and B′ should be a multiple of the wavelength λ; which is Equation A.1. The diffraction
condition in Equation A.1 is referred to as Bragg’s law. The angle θ is called the Bragg
angle, whereas 2θ is called the diffraction angle. The index n is called the order of diffraction. The incidence angle θ is the angle between the incident X-ray and the atomic planes
within the crystal and not the angle at the actual crystal surface. The crystal surface, whatever
shape, does not affect the diffraction process because X-rays penetrate the crystal and then
become diffracted by a series of parallel atomic planes. The Bragg diffraction condition has
much wider applications than just crystallography; for example, it is of central importance to
the operation of modern semiconductor lasers.

X-ray Diffraction and Study of Crystal Structures
When an X-ray beam is incident on a single crystal, the scattered beam from a given set of
planes in the crystal is at an angle 2θ that satisfies the Bragg law. In three dimensions, all

directions from the crystal that are at an angle 2θ to the incident beam define a cone as shown
in Figure A.3a with its apex at the crystal. This is called a diffraction cone. There are many
such diffraction cones, each corresponding to a different set of diffraction planes with a
distinct set of Miller indices (hkl). Although all lines lying on a diffraction cone satisfy the
Bragg condition, the exact direction of the diffracted beam depends on the exact orientation
(or tilt) of the diffracting planes to the incident ray. When a monochromatic X-ray beam is
incident on a single crystal, as illustrated in Figure A.3a, the diffracted beam is along one
particular direction on the diffraction cone for that set of diffraction planes (hkl) with a particular orientation to the incident beam.
The Laue technique of studying crystal structures involves irradiating a single crystal
with a white X-ray beam that has a wide range of wavelengths. A photographic plate is used

944

APPENDIX A
to capture the diffraction pattern as shown in Figure A.3b. Effectively, we are scanning the
wavelength λ and picking up diffractions from various (hkl) planes each time the Bragg
condition is satisfied. Thus, whenever λ and d for a particular set of (hkl) planes satisfy the
Bragg condition, there is a diffraction. The diffraction pattern is a spot pattern where each
spot is the result of diffraction from a given set of (hkl) planes oriented in a particular way
to the incident beam. By using a range of wavelengths, we ensure that the required wavelength
is available for obtaining diffraction for a given set of planes. The relative positions of the
spots are used to determine the crystal structure.
One of the simplest methods for studying crystal structures is the powder technique,
which involves irradiating a powdered crystal, or a polycrystalline sample, with a collimated
X-ray beam of known wavelength (monochromatic) as shown in Figure A.3c. Powdering the
crystal enables a given set of (hkl) planes to receive the X-rays at many different angles θ
and at many different orientations, or tilts. Put differently, it allows the angle θ to be scanned
for differently oriented crystals. Since all possible crystal orientations are present by virtue
powdering, the diffracted rays form diffraction cones and the diffraction pattern developed
on a photographic plate has diffraction rings as shown in Figure A.3c.
Each diffraction ring in the powder technique in Figure A.3c represents diffraction from
a given set of (hkl) planes. Whenever the angle θ satisfies the Bragg law for a given set of
atomic planes, with Miller indices (hkl) and with an interplanar separation dhkl, there is a
diffracted beam. An X-ray detector placed at an angle 2θ with respect to the through-beam
will register a peak in the detected X-ray intensity, as shown in Figure A.4a. The instrument
that allows this type of X-ray diffraction study is called a diffractometer. The variation of
the detected intensity with the diffraction angle 2θ represents the diffraction pattern of the
crystal. The particular diffraction pattern depicted in Figure A.4b is for aluminum, an FCC
crystal. Different crystals exhibit different diffraction patterns.
In the case of cubic crystals, the interplanar spacing d is related to the Miller indices of
a plane (hkl). The separation dhkl between adjacent (hkl) planes is given by

dhkl =

[A.2]

where a is the lattice parameter (side of the cubic unit cell). When we substitute for d = dhkl
in the Bragg condition in Equation A.1, square both sides, and rearrange the equation, we find

condition for
cubic crystals

(sin θ) 2 =

n2 λ2 2
(h + k2 + l2 )
4a2

[A.3]

This is essentially Bragg’s law for cubic crystals. The diffraction angle increases with
(h2 + k2 + l2). Higher-order Miller indices, those with greater values of (h2 + k2 + l2), give
rise to wider diffraction angles. For example, the diffraction angle for (111) is smaller than
that for (200) because (h2 + k2 + l2) is 3 for (111) and 4 for (200). Furthermore, with λ and
a values that are typically involved in X-ray diffraction, second- and higher-order diffraction
peaks, n = 2, 3, . . . , can be ruled out.
In the case of the simple cubic crystal, all possible (hkl) planes give rise to diffraction
peaks with diffraction angles satisfying the Bragg law or Equation A.3. The latter equation
therefore defines a diffraction pattern for the simple cubic crystal structure because it generates
all the possible values of 2θ for all the planes in the cubic crystal. In the case of FCC and BCC
crystals, however, not all (hkl) planes give rise to diffraction peaks predicted by Equation A.3.

crystal.

Examination of the diffraction pattern in Figure A.4b for an FCC crystal shows that only those
planes with Miller indices that are either all odd or all even integers give rise to diffraction
peaks. There are no diffractions from those planes with mixed odd and even integers.
The Bragg law for the cubic crystals in Equation A.3 is a necessary diffraction condition
but not sufficient because diffraction involves the interaction of EM waves with the electrons
in the crystal. To determine whether there will be a diffraction peak from a set of planes in
a crystal, we also have to consider the distributions of the atoms and their electrons in the
crystal. In FCC and BCC structures, diffractions from certain planes are missing because the
atoms on these planes give rise to out-of-phase reflections.

Erwin Schrödinger (1887 – 1961) was an Austrian physicist who won
the Nobel prize in physics with Paul Dirac in 1933 “for the discovery of
new productive forms of atomic theory”. Based on the view that electrons can have particle-like and wave-like properties, he formulated
his famous time-independent Schrödinger equation in 1926 in a paper
entitled “Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem” (Quantization as an
Eigenvalue Problem) in Annalen der Physik (Volume 384, Issue 4,
361-376), in which he solved it for the hydrogen atom and showed that
it gave the right energies. The 1926 Analen der Physics volume had
several papers from Schrödinger, including the harmonic oscillator
problem in Chapter 4. (Courtesy of Interfoto / Alamy Stock Photo)
